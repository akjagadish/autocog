## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

        )

    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

## Replacement

### `pi_3` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** **Limited-Sample Noisy Cue Counting (LSNC).** People neither integrate all cues (Tallying) nor consult a single best cue (Take-The-Best). Instead, on each choice they inspect only a *limited, randomly selected subset* of the presented expert ratings, tally feature-wise wins **within that sample only**, and pick the option that is ahead in the sample; a within-sample tie (including a sample containing no discriminating cue) forces a guess.

Three commitments define the theory:
1. **Equal-probability sampling.** The inspected subset is drawn uniformly at random from the whole profile — it is *not* validity-ordered and *not* validity-weighted. Stated validities are too weakly represented to steer the search order, so no cue enjoys priority. Consequently, on globally tally-tied, side-counterbalanced profiles the process is exactly symmetric and choice is 50/50, with no tendency to follow the most valid discriminating cue.
2. **Sample-size limitation with tie dilution.** The number of cues actually inspected, K, is a random variable with mean k < n (implemented as K = 1 + Binomial(n−1, q), so at least one cue is always read). Because the subset is drawn from *all* features, non-discriminating (tied) features occupy sampling slots and dilute the evidence: two profiles with the same raw tally margin M produce different adherence depending on how many uninformative cues pad the profile, and on the proportion (not the raw count) of informative cues won. This is the signature that dissociates LSNC from softmax Tallying, whose predictions depend only on M.
3. **Encoding noise + lapse.** Each inspected feature-wise comparison is registered with the wrong sign with probability nu (attention/encoding noise), and with probability epsilon the whole decision is replaced by a coin flip.

Because a small, noisy sample can easily reverse the sign of a large global margin, adherence to the full-tally winner is *capped well below 1* even on high-margin conflict trials — the systematic attenuation that full Tallying cannot produce without degenerate temperature — while symmetry guarantees exactly chance behaviour on tally-tied pairs.

**Rationale:** Take-The-Best (pi_1) is falsified in both directions (0.90 vs 0.474; 0.14 vs 0.65) and softmax Tallying (pi_2), while parameter-freely correct at chance on Experiment 1's tally ties, over-predicts conflict-trial adherence (0.85 vs 0.65) because a large raw margin drives its softmax to near-determinism unless beta collapses toward guessing everywhere. LSNC dissolves this tension with a single mechanism.

(1) **Experiment 1 is fit parameter-freely.** On tally-tied, side-counterbalanced profiles nA = nB, and uniform (validity-blind) subset sampling plus symmetric encoding noise make the whole process exchangeable in A/B, so p(A) = 0.5 exactly for every parameter setting. Predicted TTB-agreement = 0.50 (real 0.4738), and the only across-subject variance is binomial (0.25/32 ≈ 0.0078 vs. observed 0.0073) — matching not just the mean but the observed between-subject spread.

(2) **Experiment 2's attenuation falls out mechanically.** The two conflict configurations are (nA=1, nB=4, nT=1) and (nA=1, nB=3, nT=2). Exact enumeration gives adherence to the tally winner of ~0.60 (K=1), ~0.63 (K=2), ~0.67 (K=3) at nu ≈ 0.25, rising only slowly toward 1 as K → n. With the declared ranges (mean k ≈ 2.5, nu ≈ 0.22, eps ≈ 0.06) the pooled prediction is ≈ 0.655, essentially the observed 0.6538, and the parameter spread contributes ≈ 0.002 on top of the 0.007 binomial variance, landing near the observed 0.0092. Crucially, adherence is *capped*: no amount of increasing determinism drives it to 1 unless the sample becomes the full profile, so the model is not merely a re-tuned Tallying.

(3) **It is a genuine rival with a testable dissociation.** Because the subset is drawn from all cues — including tied ones — adherence depends on the *proportion* of informative cues won and is *diluted* by uninformative cues, not on the raw margin M. Note above that the 1-vs-4 (margin 3, one tied cue) and 1-vs-3 (margin 2, two tied cues) cases already differ by ~0.03–0.05 at fixed parameters in a direction Tallying cannot represent; a 2-0 versus 4-2 design (both M=2) yields a large predicted gap under LSNC and none under Tallying. The model uses no validity information at all, honouring the Experiment 1 evidence against validity-ordered or validity-weighted search, and it generalises to any n_features and any validity vector without refitting.
