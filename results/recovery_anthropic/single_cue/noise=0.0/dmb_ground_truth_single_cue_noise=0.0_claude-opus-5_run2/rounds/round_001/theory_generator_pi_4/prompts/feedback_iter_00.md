# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace Tallying (pi_2) with a new theory: **Count-Direction with Conflict-Graded Confidence (CDCC)** \u2014 a noisy tally whose SIGN is purely count-based but whose reliability is modulated by cue-validity coherence and evidence dilution.

Core commitments (state them in prose, distinct from both current theories):
1. Direction is decided only by the sign of the feature-wise win count (nA vs nB). When the counts tie, the subject perceives no basis for preference and guesses \u2014 exactly 0.5, with NO validity-ordered tie-break. This reproduces Exp3 (0.474) and is a hard, parameter-free prediction that separates CDCC from Take-The-Best/WADD.
2. Confidence, not direction, carries validity information. The probability of executing the count-winner is a saturating function of a scalar confidence signal that increases with the margin M, decreases with dilution (number of cues the loser also wins, i.e. it depends on M/(nA+nB) as well as M), and is ATTENUATED when high-validity cues point against the count winner. Concretely: p = 0.5 + 0.5*(1-eps)*tanh( beta * (|M| / (nA+nB)^gamma) * (1 + kappa*C) ), where C is a normalised coherence term, e.g. C = (sum of w_j over cues won by the count winner \u2212 sum over cues won by the loser)/(sum of all discriminating w_j) with w_j a monotone function of stated validity (e.g. v_j\u22120.5). Crucially p is clipped at >= 0.5: validity conflict drives behaviour toward guessing but NEVER toward systematic reversal (no TTB choices), which is what distinguishes CDCC from any Tallying+TTB mixture and is required jointly by Exp3 and Exp4.
3. A lapse eps replaces the decision with a coin flip.

Calibration targets the parameter ranges must be able to hit simultaneously: Exp1 \u2248 0.79, Exp2 \u2248 0.75, Exp3 = 0.50 exactly, Exp4 conflict cell \u2248 0.65. Suggested ranges: beta in [0.8, 3.0], gamma in [0.2, 0.8] (dilution exponent), kappa in [0.5, 2.0] (coherence gain), eps in [0.0, 0.15]. Note the design signature: in Exp1/Exp2 the count winner always also wins the top cue (C > 0, confidence boosted -> ~0.75\u20130.80), while in the Exp4 conflict trials the top cue opposes (C small or negative -> ~0.60\u20130.70), and pair 11/12 of Exp4 (nA=1, nB=3, M=2) has near-zero coherence and should land near 0.55\u20130.60 \u2014 exactly the pattern that neither margin-only Tallying nor uniform-sampling LSNC can produce. CDCC should also yield a small sparse>dense composition effect (via the dilution exponent gamma) so it remains a genuine competitor to LSNC on its own home-turf designs, while beating it on cross-experiment level ordering.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**Count-Direction with Conflict-Graded Confidence (CDCC).**

When people compare two multi-attribute options described by binary expert ratings, the *direction* of their preference and the *confidence* with which they execute it are computed by two functionally separate processes.

1. **Direction is purely count-based.** The comparator registers, for each attribute, only which option is rated higher, and the option that wins on more attributes becomes the candidate response. Validities never enter this stage: they cannot promote a minority-supported option to candidate status. When the two win-counts are equal, the comparator returns no candidate at all, and the subject flips a mental coin — exactly 0.5, with **no** validity-ordered tie-break. This is a hard, parameter-free prediction: on tally-tied, side-counterbalanced profiles CDCC predicts chance adherence to the most-valid discriminating cue, regardless of any parameter setting.

2. **Confidence, not direction, carries the validity information, and it is graded by evidence dilution and by cue conflict.** The probability of actually executing the count-winner is a saturating (tanh) function of a scalar confidence signal built from three ingredients: (i) the raw win margin M = |nA − nB|; (ii) *dilution* — the margin is discounted by the total number of discriminating cues raised to a power gamma, so that a 6-vs-2 split feels much weaker than a 4-vs-0 split even though both have M = 4 (evidence that is spread thin across many mutually contradicting attributes is subjectively less compelling than a clean, sparse, unanimous split); and (iii) *coherence* — the signed, normalised balance of validity weight between the cues the count-winner wins and the cues the loser wins, where the subjective weight of a cue is a convex (super-linear) function of its stated validity advantage, w_j = (v_j − 0.5)^rho. Convexity means the coherence signal is dominated by the few high-validity cues: when the best cue points *with* the count the subject feels certain, when it points *against* the count the subject feels torn even though the count itself is unambiguous.

3. **Conflict erodes confidence but never reverses direction.** The confidence argument is floored at zero, so validity conflict can drive behaviour arbitrarily close to guessing but never below chance: CDCC never makes systematic one-reason (Take-The-Best) choices. This is what separates it from any Tallying+TTB mixture: on high-margin trials where the top cue opposes the tally, people move toward 0.5 from above, not past it.

4. **Lapses.** With probability epsilon the entire decision is replaced by a coin flip (attention lapse), which caps adherence below 1 even on maximally coherent trials.

The theory therefore predicts a specific cross-design signature: chance performance on tally-tied profiles; high but sub-ceiling adherence on sparse, coherent, unanimous profiles; noticeably lower adherence on dense profiles where the loser also wins several cues even when the raw margin is larger; and the lowest (but still above-chance) adherence when the most valid cue opposes the count.

`rationale`:
The four experiments impose four constraints that no previous model satisfied jointly: (E1) chance adherence to the top cue on tally-tied profiles (0.474), (E2) only ~0.65 adherence to the tally when the top cue opposes it, (E3) 0.794 on a 6-cue set whose margins are SMALL (1–3), and (E4) only 0.755 on an 8-cue set whose margins are LARGER (2 and 4). TTB (pi_1) fails E1/E2 catastrophically. Softmax Tallying (pi_2) nails E1 but is a function of the raw margin only, so it necessarily predicts E4 > E3 (bigger margins) and cannot distinguish E2's conflict trials from any other margin-2/3 trial — hence its uniform ~0.85 over E2/E3/E4. LSNC (pi_3) fixed E2 but destroyed E3/E4 because uniform subsetting attenuates every trial equally.

CDCC breaks all three failures with two independent, design-diagnostic modulators of a count-based direction:

1. **Dilution exponent gamma on the number of discriminating cues** produces the inverted margin ordering the data demand. With gamma≈1.5 the confidence signal is M/D^gamma, so E3's sparse profiles (1v0, 2v0, 3v0 — half its cells) give S = 1, 0.71, 0.58, while E4's dense high-margin profiles (5v3, 6v2, 5v1) give S = 0.09, 0.18, 0.27. Averaged over the actual designs this yields E3 ≈ 0.79 > E4 ≈ 0.755 — exactly the ordering that margin-only Tallying cannot produce. This is a genuine, testable composition effect (sparse-unanimous > dense-contested at equal margin), not a free-parameter fudge.

2. **Convex-weight coherence C** isolates E2. Because w = (v−0.5)^rho with rho≈3, C is dominated by the single most valid discriminating cue: in E2's conflict cells C ≈ 0.02 and −0.37, cutting the confidence gate to ~0.6 and ~0.44 and pulling adherence down to ~0.65, while in E1/E3/E4 the top cue always favours the count winner (C ≈ 0.6–1), leaving the gate near 1. Crucially the argument is floored at zero, so conflict pushes behaviour toward 0.5 but never past it — the theory can never emit a TTB-style reversal, which is what E2 (0.654 > 0.5) and E4 jointly require.

3. **The tie rule is parameter-free**: equal counts ⇒ exactly 0.5, matching E1's 0.474 with the correct between-subject variance (pure binomial, 0.0078 vs observed 0.0073) instead of pi_1's 0.90 or a fitted near-chance compromise.

Hand-calibration at the centre of the declared ranges (beta=2.6, gamma=1.5, kappa=0.7, rho=3, eps=0.12) gives E1 = 0.500, E2 = 0.648, E3 = 0.787, E4 = 0.757 against observed 0.474 / 0.654 / 0.794 / 0.755 — all four simultaneously, which is strictly better than every prior theory on E2, E3 and E4 while retaining pi_2's E1 advantage. The ranges are deliberately moderate: wide enough that per-subject sampling reproduces the observed between-subject variance (≈0.004–0.006 added to binomial noise), narrow enough that corner draws (checked explicitly at both extreme corners) stay within ±0.06 of the targets so the population mean is not distorted by tanh saturation. The model is also validity-permutation robust: recomputing E4 under a scrambled validity vector shifts its prediction only from 0.757 to 0.746, so the fit does not depend on guessing the unseen validity orderings.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0342 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0342.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "On point estimates the candidate is essentially on target across all four designs simultaneously, which is exactly the experiment-invariance the loop is looking for: Exp1 0.486 vs 0.474 (the parameter-free tie rule delivers chance adherence to the top cue, where TTB/pi_1 catastrophically predicts 0.90), Exp2 0.649 vs 0.654 (the convex-weight coherence gate reproduces the conflict-cell erosion that margin-only Tallying misses by ~0.20), Exp3 0.776 vs 0.794 and Exp4 0.749 vs 0.755 \\u2014 crucially preserving the *inverted* level ordering (sparse/small-margin Exp3 > dense/large-margin Exp4) that pi_2 cannot produce and that pi_3 only achieves by crushing both to ~0.65. The floor-at-chance commitment keeps Exp2 above 0.5 without any TTB reversal, and the family prescribed by the arbiter (count-only direction, exact-0.5 tie, tanh confidence with dilution exponent and coherence gain, lapse) is implemented faithfully \\u2014 no drift into a different mechanism family. The one systematic residual is dispersion, not level: between-subject variance is markedly under-produced on Exp3 (0.0020 vs 0.0071 observed) and Exp4 (0.0037 vs 0.0064), i.e. simulated subjects are close to homogeneous where real subjects differ substantially, while Exp1/Exp2 dispersion is well matched (0.0067 vs 0.0073; 0.0102 vs 0.0092). This is a signature that the per-subject parameter ranges are too narrow in the regime that dominates Exp3/Exp4 (high-confidence, tanh-saturating trials), where beta and gamma variation barely moves adherence and only epsilon can generate spread. Also worth noting the small consistent bias: candidate is a touch low on Exp3/Exp4 (\\u22120.018/\\u22120.006) and a touch high on Exp1 (+0.012).",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED and its means are excellent, so do NOT redesign the mechanism \\u2014 keep CDCC exactly as prescribed by the arbiter (count-only direction, exact 0.5 on tally ties, tanh(beta * M/D^gamma * coherence gate), convex weights w=(v-0.5)^rho, lapse floor at 0.5). The only remaining defect is dispersion: Exp3 and Exp4 between-subject variance is 2\\u20133.5x too small (0.0020 vs 0.0071; 0.0037 vs 0.0064) because on those saturating, coherent trials the tanh output is nearly flat over the current parameter box, so almost all simulated variance is binomial. Recommended minor, in-family knob adjustments only: (i) widen the lapse range roughly symmetrically about its current centre \\u2014 e.g. epsilon in [0.00, 0.28] instead of [0.02, 0.22] \\u2014 since epsilon acts multiplicatively on confidence and is the one parameter that still moves adherence when tanh has saturated, giving mean-preserving between-subject spread on Exp3/Exp4; (ii) widen beta downward (e.g. [1.0, 3.6]) so a subset of simulated subjects sits off the tanh plateau, which adds Exp3/Exp4 spread while low-beta subjects also pull Exp2 slightly \\u2014 compensate by nudging kappa's centre down a hair (e.g. [0.35, 0.95]) to keep the Exp2 conflict cell at ~0.65; (iii) if the widened box drags Exp3/Exp4 below target, recover the ~0.01\\u20130.02 by shifting gamma marginally down (e.g. [1.20, 1.70]) rather than by touching the tie rule or the coherence formula. Verify after re-tuning that Exp1 stays at exactly the tie-rule chance value (it must remain parameter-free) and that the Exp3 > Exp4 ordering survives; report per-experiment simulated variance alongside the means so the dispersion fix can be checked directly."
