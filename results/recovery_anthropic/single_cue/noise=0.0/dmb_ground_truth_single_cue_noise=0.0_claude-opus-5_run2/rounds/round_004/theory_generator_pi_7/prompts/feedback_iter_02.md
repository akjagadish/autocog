# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with a *graded* inverse-validity tallying account that removes coarse tiering and the unconditional majority discount, and that explains the large-panel washout by smooth dilution rather than by a hard capacity cliff. Sketch:

**Gated Linear Inverse-Validity Integration with Panel-Size Dilution (GLIV-D).**
1. Count gate (shared with pi_6, strongly supported by Exp3, Exp1's tied cells and Exp2's C3): if nA == nB the display is non-diagnostic and P(A)=0.5 exactly, with no validity tie-break and no take-the-best fallback.
2. When a strict count winner exists, evidence is E = sum_j w_j * sign(a_j - b_j) with a *linear* (or at most mildly concave, exponent 0.8-1.2) panel-relative inverse-validity weight w_j = 1 - lam * (v_j - v_min)/(v_max - v_min), lam in ~0.85-1.20. This is the crucial departure from pi_6: mid-panel experts must retain roughly half-weight so that two mids (~.74/.70) exactly offset one floor voice (~.52) \, forcing Exp2's C4 to ~0.50 rather than 0.83, while still making the top expert near-zero/slightly negative (preserving Exp7/Exp8's large negative contrasts and Exp9's 0.66).
3. Graded dilution instead of a 7.5-expert step: slope beta is divided by D^gamma * (n/6)^tau (tau ~0.6-1.2, gamma ~0.7-1.0). This must reproduce, without any threshold, that star-backed dense majorities on n=6/7 panels are reversed or well below chance (Exp1, Exp7, Exp8) while the same structural profiles on n=8 panels regress to chance (Exp10 obs 0.485), and that overall tally adherence on mixed dense displays stays ~0.75-0.80 (Exp5 0.794, Exp6 0.755).
4. Only a mild release of the discount when a single cue discriminates (lam_eff scaled by (D-1)/((D-1)+kappa), kappa small), plus a lapse ~0.10-0.20 keeping predictions off the 0/1 rails \, the observed values are all intermediate (0.40-0.79, or -0.02), so parameter ranges should be chosen so that no cell is pushed past ~0.90 or below ~0.10.

Calibration targets the new theory must hit simultaneously: Exp1 ~0.40-0.45; Exp2 ~-0.10 to +0.05; Exp3 ~0.48-0.52; Exp4 ~0.62-0.70; Exp5 ~0.78-0.82; Exp6 ~0.73-0.78; Exp7 ~-0.75; Exp8 ~-0.90; Exp9 ~0.65-0.70; Exp10 ~0.45-0.52. It should be designed to be *distinguishable* from pi_6 by two clean signatures: (i) mid-panel-backed majorities facing a lone star should be clearly above chance under GLIV-D but near chance under pi_6's saturating inversion, and (ii) the n=7 -> n=8 transition should be smooth under GLIV-D but a step under pi_6's capacity gate.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**Superlinear Redundancy-Discounted Tallying with Baselined Seniority-Scaled Dissent Salience and Two-Regime Panel-Size Precision Dilution (SR-DT-3).**

People told the validities of a panel of binary expert ratings do not weight experts *by* validity; they weight them by how much *news* a rating carries, which is a decreasing function of how senior the expert is inside the displayed panel. Six commitments.

**(1) The count comparator is a gate, not a weight.** Before any expert is evaluated, an unweighted feature-wise comparison asks: does one product win on strictly more attributes? If not (equal win-counts, including wholly non-discriminating displays), the display is construed as non-diagnostic: choice is exactly 0.5, with NO validity tie-break and NO take-the-best fallback. Parameter-free: on tally-tied, side-counterbalanced profiles adherence to the most-valid discriminating cue is exactly chance whatever the validity vector.

**(2) Seniority is measured against the chance baseline and the panel's best voice, and the discount is SUPERLINEAR in seniority.** s_j = (v_j - 0.5)/(v_max - 0.5), clipped to [0,1]; news value w_j = 1 - lambda * s_j^omega with omega > 1. The discount is negligible across the bottom half of the panel, about half weight for genuine mid-panel experts, and only for the top one or two voices does it drive weight to zero or below. Two mid-panel experts therefore roughly offset one floor-level voice, while a single top expert is worth nothing or less.

**(3) Redundancy requires same-side corroboration.** An expert is discounted only because he is heard as restating what colleagues pointing the same way already say: lambda_side = lambda_n * (m_side - 1)/((m_side - 1) + kappa). A lone voice cannot be redundant with anybody.

**(4) A lone voice is heard at MORE than face value, with a seniority-graded bonus on top of a constant dissent baseline.** Being the only expert who differentiates the products is intrinsically arresting — any solitary discriminating voice is taken at slightly above face value (baseline phi0 >= 1) — and the surplus grows with the speaker's standing: w = phi0 + (phi - phi0) * s_j. This yields a graded dissociation rather than an all-or-none one: a solitary near-perfect authority can hold its own against a four-cue majority (Exp2's 1-vs-4 conflict cell sits at chance), while a solitary *floor-level* voice, though slightly amplified by its isolation, only just balances a mid-panel pair (Exp10's C4 sits at chance instead of being outvoted). A pure face-value construal for lone low-validity cues is too weak; a flat large bonus is too strong; the baseline-plus-seniority form is the unique intermediate that satisfies both cells.

**(5) Precision falls with conflict and, in two regimes, with panel size.** Confidence is beta * E / (D^gamma * (n/n_ref)^tau * (1 + eta * max(0, n - 7))). Weighted evidence spread across many mutually contradicting cues is compressed superlinearly (gamma > 1); decision precision degrades mildly and smoothly with panel size across the ordinary range (small tau), and then sharply once the panel exceeds the ~7-item working-memory span (eta), where the subject can no longer hold the whole display in mind at once. This is a *graded* two-regime dilution, not a cliff.

**(6) Ordering fidelity decays smoothly with panel span.** lambda_n = lambda * exp(-rho * max(0, n - 7)): the seniority discount fades once the panel exceeds span. Combined with (5), 8-expert panels show a weakened inversion (star-backed dense majorities regress to chance rather than being reversed) *and* markedly lower overall tally adherence, while six- and seven-expert panels show the sharpest tallying and the strongest inversion. An attention lapse epsilon mixes every decision with a coin flip.

**Cross-design signature:** exact chance on tally-tied displays of any validity composition; strong reversal of chorus-backed star majorities on six/seven-expert panels; near-chance for the same structure on eight-expert panels together with visibly reduced (but still above-chance) pure tally adherence there; near-ceiling following of a lone high-validity discriminating cue; near-chance when a lone star opposes a broad majority; and mid-panel-backed majorities facing a lone floor voice sitting essentially at chance.

`rationale`:
Minimal-diff edit on the ACCEPTED base (loss 0.1266). Two lines of `predict` change plus two new scalars; every commitment, name and equation is otherwise byte-identical.

**(A) Two-regime panel-size dilution — implements the critic's item (2), and fixes Exp4/Exp8.** `size_fac` becomes `(n/6)^tau * (1 + eta*max(0, n-7))` with tau now in [0.0,0.4] and a new eta in [1.2,2.2]. At n=6 it is exactly 1 (as before); at n=7 it is now ~1.00-1.06 instead of ~1.47, restoring the slope the critic identified as having flattened Exp6; at n=8 it is ~1.8-3.0 (mean ~2.7) versus the old ~2.05, i.e. the supra-span penalty is *strengthened* exactly where the two n=8 experiments need it. Hand-computation: Exp4's mean underlying z (1.92 at 0.824 adherence) falls by ~1.4x to ~1.40 -> adherence ~0.762 (real 0.755, was 0.824, the largest single residual); Exp8's z of -0.20 shrinks to -0.145 -> 0.469 (real 0.485, was 0.456). Exp6 gains the restored n=7 slope: recomputing all six cells of its metric by hand gives d1 ~ -0.83 (from -0.773), moving the total from -0.794 toward ~-0.84 (real -0.938). Exp1/2/3/5/7/9 (n=5,6) are untouched by construction.

**(B) A baseline on the lone-dissent salience — fixes Exp10, the corpus's key discriminator.** The lone-voice weight becomes `w = phi0 + (phi - phi0)*s_j` (phi0 in [1.00,1.15]) instead of `1 + (phi-1)*s_j`. Theoretically: isolation is itself arresting, so *any* solitary discriminating voice is heard slightly above face value, with the surplus still graded by standing. Quantitatively this is the only cell in the corpus that moves much: in Exp10's C4 (mid pair .74/.70 versus the lone floor expert .52 on an n=7 panel) the restored n=7 slope from edit (A) would otherwise have driven the contrast from -0.070 to ~-0.079; with phi0 ~1.08 the lone floor voice weighs ~1.11 against the mid pair's ~1.10, so C4 lands at ~0.48-0.52 and the C4-C3 contrast lands near -0.01 (real -0.0225). Everywhere the lone voice is the *star* (Exp2 cell 1, Exp5, Exp6 pair 2, Exp7 trial 3) s~1 so the weight is still phi and nothing changes; where the lone voice is mid/low the small lift pushes Exp2 (0.692 -> ~0.68, real 0.654) and Exp9 (0.445 -> ~0.43, real 0.405) in the right direction, at a cost of only ~+0.013 on Exp7.

**(C) Why I did NOT add the critic's top-priority opposition gate (lam_eff = lam_side * m_lose/(m_lose+kappa2)).** Its stated justification was that the model's Exp6 d2 (sparse-unanimous minus dense-unanimous) is positive. I recomputed Exp6's two unanimous cells by hand with the design validities [0.94,0.58,0.86,0.63,0.72,0.80,0.55]: the sparse cell (A wins f2,f4; D=2) gives p~0.865 and the dense cell (A wins f0,f3,f5,f6; D=4) gives p~0.919, i.e. the model's d2 is already **-0.054**, the correct sign. Zeroing the discount on unanimous displays would send both to the lapse ceiling (~0.935) and push d2 to 0, *worsening* Exp6 by ~0.05 and cancelling the entire gain from edit (A) on the very metric the gate was meant to repair; it would also make Exp10's C4 mid-pair evidence larger and drive that contrast to ~-0.14. Its remaining benefits (Exp3 +0.02, Exp5/Exp7 +0.015 each) do not cover that. I therefore kept commitment (3) as pure same-side corroboration and used the critic's items (2) and (3) instead. I also left phi's upper bound trimmed only slightly ([1.15,1.55]) rather than to 1.40, because phi is what keeps Exp2's 1-vs-4 star cell at chance and Exp3's lone-star unanimous cell at ceiling. The parameter-free count gate (Exp1) is untouched, and lam/omega are unchanged so Exp5/6/7/9's inversion signatures are preserved.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1528 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1266 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1046 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.1046.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a clear overall success within the arbiter's prescribed family: it reproduces the two hardest signatures in the corpus — the large negative coherence-contrast on n=6/7 panels (Exp5 -0.796 vs -0.763; Exp6 -0.847 vs -0.938), the marginal-tier preference on Exp7 (0.708 vs 0.661), the near-chance star-backed-majority adherence on the n=8 panel (Exp8 0.533 vs 0.485), the below-chance marginal-net metric of Exp9 (0.454 vs 0.405), the chance-level tally-tie gate of Exp1 (0.513 vs 0.474) and, crucially, Exp10's near-zero contrast (-0.091 vs -0.023) where both pi_5 (-0.73) and pi_6 (+0.33) failed catastrophically in opposite directions. The chance-anchored superlinear seniority profile plus same-side corroboration is doing exactly what the rationale claims: mid experts retain roughly half weight, so the C4 mid-pair-vs-floor cell lands near chance rather than at either rail, and lone dissenters are resisted rather than inverted. Residual misfit is concentrated in three cells, and it has a clean, interpretable structure. (i) Exp4 (n=8, pure tally adherence) is badly OVER-predicted: 0.872 vs 0.755. Because ordering fidelity decays as exp(-rho*(n-7)), the inversion largely switches off on 8-expert panels and the model degenerates into near-pure tallying with a big slope, giving near-ceiling adherence. (ii) Exp3 (n=6, pure tally adherence) is UNDER-predicted: 0.713 vs 0.794. So the model has the n=6 vs n=8 adherence ordering backwards relative to the data: humans follow the tally *more* on the smaller panel and regress toward chance on the larger one, whereas the candidate does the reverse. (iii) Exp2 conflict adherence is over-predicted (0.794 vs 0.654): the lone-dissenter release (lam_side=0 at m=1) plus a strong slope makes a lone star too easy to outvote. Together these mean the fade-with-n mechanism is currently the *only* thing that changes with panel size, and it changes the wrong quantity — it removes the discount instead of removing decision precision.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED and should remain the base; the request is for a targeted, in-family tune, not a redesign. Keep every commitment intact (count gate, chance-anchored superlinear seniority s=(v-0.5)/(v_max-0.5) with omega>1, same-side corroboration lambda_side, conflict dilution D^gamma, span-graded fidelity, lapse). Three minor adjustments, in priority order: (1) Add the arbiter's panel-size SLOPE dilution that the current version omitted: z = beta*E / (D^gamma * (n/6)^tau) with tau ~0.6-1.2. Right now panel size only fades the discount (lam_n), never the precision, which is why the n=8 experiments split — Exp4 goes to ceiling (0.872 vs 0.755) while Exp8 needs chance. A slope divided by (8/6)^tau pulls Exp4 down toward ~0.78-0.80 and nudges Exp8 from 0.533 toward 0.49, without touching the n=6/7 fits (Exp5/6/7/9/10) at all. (2) Compensate on n=6 by raising beta modestly (shift the range up to roughly [13, 19]) and/or narrowing epsilon to ~[0.08, 0.16]; Exp3 needs +0.08 of tally adherence at n=6, and once (1) is in place the extra slope no longer inflates Exp4. (3) For Exp2, soften the full lone-voice release rather than removing it: use lam_side = lam_n * (m-1+delta)/((m-1+delta)+kappa) with a small delta>0, or equivalently give a lone dissenting cue a weight slightly ABOVE 1 (a dissent-salience factor phi in ~[1.0,1.4] applied only when m_side==1). Either knob lets a solitary star resist a 4-cue majority harder, moving Exp2 from 0.79 toward the observed 0.65, and it will also shave the small over-prediction on Exp7. Do NOT increase lam/omega globally to fix Exp2 — that would re-break Exp10's near-zero contrast, which is currently the candidate's best discriminating win. Also leave the parameter-free count gate untouched: Exp1 is already fine.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1528 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1266 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-2 candidate is the running best (0.1266 vs 0.1528) and my previous top-priority advice (add a panel-size SLOPE dilution term (n/6)^tau, raise beta, add a lone-dissent factor) was validated by the gate. The two biggest previous errors were repaired: Exp2 fell 0.794 -> 0.692 (real 0.654) thanks to the seniority-scaled phi, and Exp4 fell 0.872 -> 0.824 (real 0.755) thanks to the size dilution, while Exp8 moved 0.533 -> 0.456 (real 0.485) and Exp10 stayed near-zero (-0.070 vs -0.023) — still the corpus's cleanest discriminating win versus pi_5 (-0.73) and pi_6 (+0.33). The signature negative coherence contrasts remain intact (Exp5 -0.805 vs -0.763; Exp7 0.713 vs 0.661; Exp9 0.445 vs 0.405) and the count gate keeps Exp1 at chance.

Residual error is now concentrated in two places, both about UNANIMOUS / non-conflicting dense displays rather than about the inversion itself.
(i) Exp6 is the largest residual (-0.794 vs -0.938, Δ +0.143) and it got WORSE than iter 1 (-0.847). Exp6's metric is d1 (coherence contrast, computed only on trials where both sides discriminate) plus d2 (sparse-unanimous minus dense-unanimous adherence). d1 is well captured elsewhere (Exp5, Exp7), so the shortfall is most plausibly in d2: in the current model an unanimous display with many cues gets a LARGER same-side redundancy discount (lam_side grows with m_side) while the D^gamma term keeps per-cue evidence flat, so dense unanimous adherence ends up BELOW sparse unanimous — i.e. model d2 > 0 where the data want d2 <= 0. Raising tau to [2,3] also diluted n=7 by ~1.5x, further flattening Exp6 relative to iter 1, which is exactly the wrong direction for this experiment.
(ii) Exp3 (n=6 pure tally adherence) is under-predicted and, despite the beta raise, drifted DOWN 0.713 -> 0.691 (real 0.794). Inspection of Exp3's profiles shows most majorities are star-backed, so the seniority discount plus the new phi bonus on lone opposing stars actively suppresses tally adherence there. Exp4 (n=8) is still over (0.824 vs 0.755). So the n=6 (needs more adherence) / n=8 (needs less) tension that I flagged in iter 1 is reduced but not resolved.
Rationale: Keep the accepted base and all six commitments (count gate, chance-anchored superlinear seniority, same-side corroboration, D^gamma conflict dilution, span-graded fidelity, lapse, seniority-scaled lone salience) — this is squarely in the arbiter's graded inverse-validity + panel-dilution family and is faithful to it. Three minor, in-family knobs, in priority order:

(1) NEW (top priority, targets Exp6 and Exp3 simultaneously): make the redundancy discount require OPPOSITION, not just same-side corroboration. Multiply lam_side by an opposition factor, lam_eff = lam_side * m_lose/(m_lose + kappa2) with kappa2 small (~0.05-0.3), so that an unopposed (unanimous) display carries essentially no inverse-validity discount and is followed strongly regardless of how many cues back it. Rationale: an expert can only be heard as 'redundant hype' when someone points the other way; with no dissent the tally is unambiguous. This raises dense-unanimous adherence, which (a) drives Exp6's d2 from positive toward ~0/negative and should recover most of the +0.143 gap without touching d1 (d1 is computed only on trials with n_lose>0, so Exp5/Exp7/Exp8/Exp9 conflict cells are untouched), and (b) lifts Exp3 toward 0.79. Note this is the opposite sign of the small over-negativity on Exp5 (-0.805 vs -0.763), so it should help there too.

(2) Re-reference the panel-size precision dilution instead of strengthening it further. Adding (n/6)^tau was accepted, so do NOT remove it — but tau in [2,3] over-penalises n=7, which is where Exp6 and Exp10 live and where Exp6 regressed. Use size_fac = (max(n,7)/7)^tau (i.e. no extra dilution until the panel exceeds 7) or equivalently keep (n/6)^tau but drop tau to ~[0.8,1.5] and add a separate n>7 term. This restores slope at n=7 (Exp6 more negative) while keeping the n=8 correction that fixed Exp4/Exp8. Since fix (1) will push Exp4 up again, the n>7 dilution exponent can carry the extra load (tau_8 effective ~2-3 at n=8).

(3) Trim phi slightly (range ~[1.05,1.40] instead of [1.15,1.65]) and keep beta where it is. Exp2 is now only +0.038 off, so phi has done its job; but the lone-star bonus is part of what is depressing Exp3's tally adherence, and a smaller phi combined with (1) should keep Exp2 near 0.65-0.70 while letting Exp3 climb.

Do NOT touch the parameter-free count gate (Exp1 fine), do not raise lam/omega globally (that would re-break Exp10's near-zero contrast, the candidate's best discriminator), and do not revisit the delta-style softening of the lone-voice release that I mooted in iter 1 — the seniority-scaled phi already covers that ground.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1266 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1046 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "The iter-3 candidate is the running best (0.1046, down from 0.1266 and 0.1528) and my last round's advice (re-reference the panel-size dilution to a two-regime form, keep tau small below n=7 and add an n>7 term; trim the lone-dissent bonus) was validated by the gate: Exp4 fell 0.824 -> 0.784 (real 0.755), Exp8 landed at 0.497 (real 0.485), Exp6 recovered from -0.794 to -0.871 (real -0.938), and Exp10 \u2014 the corpus's cleanest discriminator, where pi_5 gives -0.73 and pi_6 gives +0.33 \u2014 is now -0.011 vs real -0.023. Exp1's parameter-free count gate is essentially exact (0.492 vs 0.474). The theory stays inside the arbiter's prescribed family (graded panel-relative inverse-validity weighting + graded panel-size dilution + count gate + lapse); the superlinear seniority profile and lone-dissent salience are elaborations of, not departures from, that family, so faithfulness is fine.\n\nThe residual structure is now sharply one-sided and diagnostic. Nine of ten experiments are within ~0.06; the outlier is Exp3 (pure n=6 tally adherence): 0.665 vs real 0.794, a -0.129 gap that has grown monotonically across all three iterations (0.713 -> 0.691 -> 0.665). Every other misfit points the SAME direction as Exp3: the model is systematically OVER-inverting. Exp5 -0.818 vs -0.763 (too negative), Exp7 0.710 vs 0.661 (too much marginal-tier preference), Exp9 0.438 vs 0.405 (hmm, this one is too high, i.e. under-inverted), Exp2 0.715 vs 0.654 (tally adherence too high on conflict trials, which under this model is driven by the star's NEGATIVE weight actively counting against its own side). The common cause is that with lam ~1.35-1.90 and s=1 for the panel's top expert, w_top = 1 - lam is strongly negative (down to -0.9): the star does not merely fail to count, it counts for the opponent. That is what depresses star-backed majorities in Exp3 (whose cells are mostly star-backed and even unanimous) and what inflates Exp2's tally adherence and Exp5/Exp7's inversion beyond the observed magnitudes.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED and should remain the base \u2014 do not redesign, do not leave the arbiter's family. One targeted in-family knob, plus two smaller ones.\n\n(1) TOP PRIORITY \u2014 floor the news-value weight so the top expert is IGNORED, not ANTI-COUNTED. Replace w_j = 1 - lam_side * s_j^omega with w_j = max(w_floor, 1 - lam_side * s_j^omega), w_floor a new free parameter in roughly [0.00, 0.25] (keep lam and omega ranges exactly as they are so the mid-panel half-weight that wins Exp10 is untouched). Theoretical gloss inside the existing story: a maximally senior voice carries no *news*, but news value cannot go negative \u2014 hearing the star endorse a product never counts as evidence against it. Predicted movement, all in the right direction on five experiments at once: Exp3 star-backed and unanimous majorities stop being penalised, adherence should climb from 0.665 toward ~0.75-0.79 (the single largest residual, ~ -0.13); Exp2's conflict cells lose the spurious pro-tally boost supplied by -w_star and should fall 0.715 -> ~0.66-0.68 (real 0.654); Exp5 should relax -0.818 -> ~ -0.77 (real -0.763); Exp7 0.710 -> ~0.67 (real 0.661); Exp9 0.438 -> ~0.41 (real 0.405). The costs are small and bounded: Exp6 loses a little negativity (-0.871 -> maybe -0.82 vs real -0.938) and Exp10's C3 cell shifts the contrast slightly positive (-0.011 -> ~+0.01, real -0.023). Net this should be a clear win; tune w_floor to the low end (~0.05-0.10) if Exp6 degrades more than ~0.05.\n\n(2) Compensate Exp6 with slope, not with a bigger discount: since (1) shrinks |E| on conflict cells, allow beta's upper bound to rise modestly (e.g. [15, 22]) and/or tighten epsilon to ~[0.07, 0.15]. This sharpens d1 on the n=6/7 panels (Exp5, Exp6, Exp7) without reintroducing negative star weights, and n=8 stays protected by the eta term that the gate has already rewarded.\n\n(3) Do NOT re-attempt the opposition gate (lam_eff scaled by m_lose/(m_lose+kappa2)) that I pushed in iter 2. The proposer declined it with an explicit hand-computation showing model d2 is already negative on Exp6, and the accepted iter-3 candidate improved without it; the weight floor in (1) reaches the same Exp3/Exp6 territory through a mechanism that is also correct for Exp2/Exp5/Exp7/Exp9. Likewise leave the count gate, the two-regime size dilution, the same-side corroboration term and the seniority-scaled lone-dissent bonus byte-identical \u2014 those are the parts the gate has repeatedly validated, and Exp1/Exp4/Exp8/Exp10 are already at or near the observed values."
