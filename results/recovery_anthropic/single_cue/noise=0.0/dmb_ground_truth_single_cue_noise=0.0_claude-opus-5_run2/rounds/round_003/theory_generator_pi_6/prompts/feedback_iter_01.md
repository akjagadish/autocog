# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace pi_4 (CDCC) with a smooth 'inverted-informativeness' integration theory 
call it Graded Validity-Inversion Weighted Tallying (GVIT) 
that is a genuinely stronger competitor to pi_5 by fixing pi_5's systematic overshoot while keeping the anti-validity sign.

Core claims:
1. SUBJECTIVE NEWS VALUE IS INVERSELY GRADED IN STATED VALIDITY. A rating from a near-perfect expert is predictable and construed as restating the obvious, so it carries little decision weight; a rating from a barely-diagnostic expert is surprising and treated as genuine private information. Formally, weights are a CONTINUOUS, panel-relative function of validity: s_j = (v_j - v_min)/(v_max - v_min) computed within the displayed panel, w_j = 1 - lambda * s_j, with lambda in roughly [0.6, 1.6] so that at high lambda the single best expert can carry a small NEGATIVE weight (active contrarianism) but at moderate lambda the ordering is merely flattened or mildly reversed. No median split, no discrete tiers, no special-case release at D=1, and no count-margin contrarian term 
every cue enters through one smooth function.
2. EVIDENCE AND CHOICE. E = sum_j w_j * sign(a_j - b_j); p(A) = logistic(beta * E / D^gamma) where D is the number of discriminating cues (dilution: evidence spread over many mutually contradicting cues is subjectively weaker; gamma ~ 0.3-0.8). When E = 0 exactly (including all tally-tied, weight-matched profiles) the model returns exactly 0.5 with no validity tie-break 
this reproduces Exp 3 (0.474) without pi_5's accidental tier-matching.
3. LARGE LAPSE / CEILING. epsilon in ~[0.15, 0.35], so even maximally coherent profiles top out near 0.75-0.88, matching the empirical ceiling in Exps 5 (0.794) and 6 (0.755) and preventing the 0.90+ / 0.10- extremes that made pi_5 miss Exps 1, 2 and 4.

Target quantitative behaviour to check while building it: Exp 7 coherent-minus-conflict about -0.5 to -0.8; Exp 8 about -0.7 to -0.95; Exp 1 marginal-tier adherence about 0.65-0.75 (NOT 0.9); Exp 2 star-backed-majority adherence about 0.42-0.55 (the +2 count margin and the inverted weights should roughly cancel once dilution at D=6 is applied); Exp 3 about 0.40-0.50; Exp 4 about 0.65-0.80; Exps 5-6 about 0.75-0.82. Choose parameter ranges (lambda, beta, gamma, epsilon) so that this whole envelope is reachable inside the box, and make sure the box does NOT contain settings that force sub-0.2 or above-0.9 predictions on dense mixed profiles.

How it differs from both incumbents: unlike pi_4 it allows adherence to the count winner to go below chance (the sign reversal actually observed), and unlike pi_5 it does so continuously and with bounded strength, with no tiering, no majority-margin discount, and no sparse-display patch 
so it should dominate pi_5 on Exps 1, 2 and 4 while matching it on Exps 7 and 8.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**Capacity-Gated Graded Validity-Inversion Tallying (GVIT-CAP).**

Four commitments describe how people combine binary expert ratings whose stated validities they have been told.

**(1) The count comparator is a gate, not a weight.** Before any evaluation of *whose* rating is whose, the subject asks a purely ordinal question: does one product win on more attributes than the other? This is answered with unweighted feature-wise comparisons. If the answer is "no" (equal numbers of winning attributes, including displays where nothing discriminates), the display is construed as *non-diagnostic*, no candidate is generated, and the subject flips a mental coin. Stated validities are **never** used as a tie-break. This is a hard, parameter-free prediction: on tally-tied, side-counterbalanced profiles, adherence to the most-valid discriminating cue is exactly chance whatever the validity vector.

**(2) When a majority exists, integration uses inverse-informativeness weights.** The subjective news value of a rating is a smooth, panel-relative, *decreasing* function of stated validity: s_j = (v_j − v_min)/(v_max − v_min) within the displayed panel, w_j = 1 − λ_eff·s_j. A near-perfect expert is construed as merely restating the obvious consensus quality of the product, so his rating adds almost nothing (and, for λ_eff > 1, is mildly counter-indicative); a barely-diagnostic expert is surprising and is treated as genuine private information carrying full weight. Evidence is the single scalar E = Σ_j w_j·sign(a_j − b_j). Because the anti-validity term can outweigh the count term inside E, this predicts *below-chance* adherence to a majority carried only by the panel's star experts, and *above-chance* adherence when the composition is reversed.

**(3) Redundancy is comparative; evidence spread over many contradicting cues is compressed.** An expert is discounted only because other experts are heard as echoing him, so the inversion scales with how many voices actually speak on the trial: λ_eff = λ_n·(D−1)/((D−1)+κ_D), where D is the number of discriminating cues; when exactly one expert differentiates the products there is no chorus and his rating is taken at face value. Confidence in E is then compressed by the *number of mutually contradicting cues*, D^γ with γ ≈ 0.8–1.0 (much stronger than a square-root discount): a clean 2-vs-1 split is far more compelling than the same weighted balance smeared over five or six mutually contradicting experts.

**(4) The inversion is a capacity-limited construal: it collapses when the panel exceeds working-memory span.** Discounting the star requires the subject to actually *hold the validity ordering of the whole panel in mind* — to know who is the star and who is the idiosyncratic voice. That ordering can be maintained only up to roughly seven experts. Beyond capacity the ordering blurs, so the redundancy construal washes out toward equal weighting (λ_n = λ·(1 − ψ·o)) and integration itself becomes noisier (slope divided by 1 + χ·o), where o = logistic((n − 7.5)/0.2) is a near-step overload indicator. This yields a sharp, design-level signature that no graded panel-size discount produces: profiles of *identical* weighted composition are followed **against** the count on 6- and 7-expert panels but drift back to near chance (and, for broadly-based majorities, back to ordinary tallying) on 8-expert panels. Finally an attention lapse ε replaces the decision by a coin flip, capping adherence near 0.91.

Cross-design signature: exact chance on tally-tied profiles; strong systematic *reversal* of star-backed majorities on panels of ≤7 experts; near-chance behaviour for the same star-backed profiles on panels of 8+ experts, together with preserved high tally adherence there for broad-mixture majorities; near-ceiling following of a lone discriminating expert; and markedly attenuated confidence whenever the weighted evidence is spread across many mutually contradicting cues.

`rationale`:
Minimal-diff edit on the accepted base: I kept the parse, the majority gate, the panel-relative weights w = 1 - lam_eff*s, the comparative-redundancy release, the single scalar E and the lapse, and changed exactly two things — (i) raised the cue-count compression (gamma 0.525 -> ~0.9, beta 6.25 -> ~6, lam 1.2 -> ~1.45), as the critic asked, and (ii) replaced the graded panel-size term (n/6)^tau by a capacity-threshold overload o = logistic((n-7.5)/0.2) that washes out the INVERSION strength (lam_n = lam*(1-psi*o)) and mildly noises integration (denominator *(1+chi*o)).

Why I deviated from 'shrink tau': I hand-computed every qualifying trial in all eight designs. The graded (n/6)^tau term is pulled in *opposite* directions by n=7 and n=8 and therefore cannot be tuned: Exp6 (n=7) needs the STRONGEST reversal in the whole battery (-0.938), while Exps 4 and 8 (both n=8) need the reversal attenuated (Exp8 star-backed majorities at chance 0.485) *and* ordinary tally adherence preserved (Exp4 0.755). Raising tau fixed Exp8 but drove Exp6 to -0.74; shrinking tau fixed Exp6 but drove Exp8 to 0.21 and Exp4 to 0.90. Crucially, Exp5 T9 (n=6: A wins 0.94/0.86/0.70/0.78, B wins 0.57/0.62) and Exp8 T5 (n=8: A wins the four stars, B wins two marginals) are the SAME weighted profile with the same D, yet humans reverse the first (~0.12) and are at chance on the second (0.485). The data show a step at panel size ~7, not a gradient — i.e. a working-memory limit on resolving *who is the star*, not a graded loss of evidence. Making capacity act on the weights (lam) rather than only on the slope also automatically restores Exp4: with the inversion half-off at n=8, broad-mixture majorities are followed at 0.75 again.

Hand-computed envelope at the box centre (lam=1.45, beta=6, gamma=0.9, kappa_d=0.10, psi=0.48, chi=0.95, eps=0.16), computed trial-by-trial from each design's own validity vector: Exp1 0.500 (real 0.474), Exp2 0.864 (0.654), Exp3 0.757 (0.794), Exp4 0.750 (0.755), Exp5 -0.756 (-0.763), Exp6 -0.851 (-0.938), Exp7 0.697 (0.661), Exp8 0.499 (0.485). Sum of squared errors 0.055 versus 0.135 for the accepted base under the same hand-calculation (which reproduced the simulator to within ~0.02 on every experiment), i.e. an expected loss well under the 0.1423 floor, with the largest single-experiment errors cut from 0.26/0.22 (Exps 2/8) to 0.21/0.01.

I deliberately did NOT take the optional attenuated tie-gate: because the inverted weights make E point away from the top expert on tally-tied trials, attenuating the gate does push Exp1 below 0.5, but the same term pushes Exp7's two tied designs ABOVE 0.5 (their E favours the marginal-preferred side), which would raise Exp7 from 0.70 toward 0.78 and cost more than the 0.026 it buys on Exp1. I also verified that no in-box draw forces >0.92 or <0.07 on dense mixed profiles, and the predictions now sit mostly in 0.6-0.9 rather than saturated, which should raise the simulated between-subject variances the critic flagged.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1423 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0952 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0952.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is clearly the best of the family so far: it nails the anti-validity signature that no other theory except pi_5 reproduces (Exp5 -0.736 vs -0.763; Exp6 -0.821 vs -0.938), it lands Exp3 (0.828 vs 0.794) and Exp4 (0.772 vs 0.755) close to target, and its majority-gate fixes pi_5's blow-ups on Exp1 (0.519 vs 0.474) and Exp7 (0.720 vs 0.661). It was accepted at loss 0.1423. However, two designs remain badly off and they are off in OPPOSITE directions, which is diagnostic rather than random noise: (a) Exp2 star-vs-count conflict trials: model 0.913 vs real 0.654 (err 0.26). Here the count winner is backed by several mid/high-validity experts while only the single top expert opposes, so both the count and the inverted weights agree and the model saturates at p_raw~1.0; humans are only mildly above chance. (b) Exp8 star-backed dense majorities: model 0.269 vs real 0.485 (err 0.22). Here the inversion over-fires in the reverse direction; humans are essentially at chance while the model commits to the anti-star option. Both failures are on DENSE displays (D=5-6 in Exp2, D>=4 in Exp8), whereas the experiments the model fits well (Exp5 coherent trials with D=3, Exp3/Exp4 large-margin trials) are sparser or lopsided. That pattern says the compression of evidence with the number of mutually discriminating cues is currently too weak (gamma~0.5 is not enough to keep z out of saturation at D=5-6), while the panel-size term (tau~2.5, n/6) is being asked to do work it cannot do cleanly: it cannot separate Exp2 (n=6) from Exp5 (n=6), and it over-attenuates Exp6 (n=7), which is exactly where the model undershoots the reversal (-0.82 vs -0.94). Note also the simulated between-subject variances are systematically smaller than the real ones (e.g. Exp2 0.0037 vs 0.0092, Exp4 0.0023 vs 0.0064), consistent with the deterministic saturation.
Rationale: Stay inside the prescribed GVIT family 
 keep the smooth panel-relative inverse-informativeness weights w_j = 1 - lambda_eff*s_j, the single scalar E, the majority gate, the comparative-redundancy release, and the lapse. The fix I want is a re-balancing of the two dilution terms, not a new mechanism.

1) SHIFT COMPRESSION FROM PANEL SIZE TO CUE COUNT. Raise gamma substantially (try a box like [0.9, 1.6] instead of [0.45, 0.60]) and simultaneously raise beta (roughly [7, 12]) so that sparse, lopsided displays stay sharp while dense contradictory displays are pulled toward chance. Hand-check with lam~1.2, kappa_d~0.1, eps~0.18: at D=3 (Exp5 coherent, |E|~1.1) beta=9/gamma=1.5 keeps adherence near 0.15-0.20 (real ~0.12), while at D=5 (Exp2 conflict, |E|~1.9) it drops the prediction from 0.91 to ~0.72-0.75, and Exp8's D=4-6 star-backed majorities rise from 0.27 toward 0.40-0.48. This is the only design variable that actually separates the experiments you fit from the two you miss (Exp2 D=5-6 vs Exp5 D=3 at identical n=6), so it should be doing the compressing.

2) SHRINK tau. With gamma carrying the load, drop the panel-size term to something small ([0.0, 1.2]) or fold it away entirely. It currently over-attenuates n=7 (Exp6 -0.82 vs real -0.94) and is the main reason Exp8 was pushed past chance rather than to it. Verify Exp4 (n=8) stays in 0.72-0.78 after the change.

3) LEAVE lam AND THE GATE ALONE. Do not lower lambda to fix Exp8 
 that would also kill the Exp5/Exp6/Exp7 reversal, which is the theory's main empirical win. Do not raise it to fix Exp2 either; lambda is being pulled in opposite directions by those two designs and D-dilution is the correct arbiter.

4) OPTIONAL SMALL KNOB (only if 1-3 leave Exp1 high): replace the hard tally-tie gate with a strongly attenuated one, z_tie = delta * z with delta in [0.03, 0.15]. Because the inverted weights make E point away from the top expert on tally-tied trials, this yields ~0.45-0.49 rather than exactly 0.50, matching Exp1's slightly-below-chance 0.474 without abandoning the gate. Check the knock-on to Exp7 (which contains tie trials) and keep it at or below ~0.70.

Acceptance targets to hand-verify before submitting: Exp1 0.46-0.51, Exp2 <=0.78 (ideally 0.68-0.75), Exp3 0.76-0.82, Exp4 0.72-0.78, Exp5 <=-0.72, Exp6 <=-0.85, Exp7 0.63-0.70, Exp8 0.38-0.50, and make sure no in-box parameter draw forces >0.95 or <0.10 on dense mixed profiles (that saturation is what is producing the too-small simulated between-subject variances).

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1423 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0952 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Iteration 2 is a genuine improvement (0.1423 -> 0.0952, ACCEPTED) and it moved in exactly the direction I asked: stronger cue-count compression (gamma 0.525 -> ~0.9) plus a higher beta cut the two dense-display failures. Exp8 went from 0.269 to 0.507 (real 0.485, err now 0.02), Exp1 from 0.519 to 0.486 (real 0.474), Exp7 from 0.720 to 0.699 (real 0.661), and the anti-validity signature is still intact and essentially unique to this family (Exp5 -0.773 vs -0.763; Exp6 -0.799 vs -0.938; compare pi_1..pi_4 which are near zero or positive). Faithfulness to the arbiter's family is acceptable: the core is still smooth panel-relative inverse-informativeness weights w_j = 1 - lam_eff*s_j, a single scalar E, D-dilution and a lapse; the only drift is that the graded panel-size term was replaced by a near-step capacity indicator o = logistic((n-7.5)/0.2). That is a sharper claim than the arbiter's 'smooth, no special-case' brief, but it is a modulation of the same weight function rather than a new family, and it is what buys the Exp5(n=6)/Exp8(n=8) dissociation, so I would not undo it.\n\nWhat is left is now dominated by ONE experiment. Exp2 conflict trials: model 0.871 vs real 0.654 (err 0.217) accounts for the large majority of the remaining squared error; every other design is within 0.04 except Exp6 (-0.799 vs -0.938, err 0.139, model UNDERSHOOTS the reversal). These two residuals pull in opposite directions on beta/eps but in the SAME direction on the D-compression knob, because Exp2's qualifying trials are dense (D = 5-6 at n=6) while Exp6's reversal trials are comparatively sparse/lopsided. Secondary symptom: simulated between-subject variances are still far below the real ones on the designs where the model is near-deterministic (Exp3 0.0015 vs 0.0071; Exp4 0.0016 vs 0.0064), indicating predictions are still clustered too tightly across parameter draws.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED and should remain the base; I want one more in-family retune, not a redesign. Keep the parse, the majority gate, w_j = 1 - lam_eff*s_j, the comparative-redundancy release, the capacity term, the single scalar E and the lapse EXACTLY as they are. Three targeted knobs:\n\n1) EXTEND (do not reverse) the compression direction that the gate rewarded last round, but only enough to fix Exp2. Push gamma modestly further, e.g. box [0.95, 1.30] instead of [0.80, 1.00], and simultaneously raise beta (e.g. [6.5, 9.0]) so that lopsided, low-D profiles do NOT lose sharpness. The point of raising both together is that z = beta*E/D^gamma then discriminates high-E/D from low-E/D more strongly: Exp2's D=5-6 conflict trials should fall from 0.87 to roughly 0.70-0.78, while Exp3/Exp4's large-margin trials must be held at 0.75-0.80 (they are currently 0.754/0.731, i.e. already ~0.03 LOW, so verify they do not sag further \\u2014 that is the binding constraint on gamma).\n\n2) SHARPEN THE REVERSAL SLIGHTLY VIA THE LAPSE, NOT VIA lam. Exp6 (-0.799 vs -0.938) is capped by eps=0.16, which ceilings |d1| near 0.84. Try eps in [0.09, 0.15]. Do NOT touch lam to fix Exp6 (raising it would blow up Exp2 and Exp8, which are now well fitted); lam is being pulled in opposite directions by Exp2 and Exp5/6 and eps/beta are the correct arbiters here.\n\n3) VARIANCE / SATURATION. Widen the parameter box a little (lam [1.25, 1.65], kappa_d [0.03, 0.25]) so simulated between-subject variance rises toward the empirical 0.006-0.009 range on Exps 3, 4, 8. Also re-verify that no in-box draw forces >0.93 or <0.07 on dense mixed (D>=5) profiles.\n\nExplicitly do NOT: reintroduce a graded (n/6)^tau panel term (my last 'shrink tau' suggestion was superseded and the capacity step outperformed it), add validity tie-breaks on tally-tied displays (Exp1 is now excellent at 0.486 vs 0.474), or add a count-margin contrarian term. Acceptance targets to hand-verify before submitting: Exp1 0.45-0.51, Exp2 0.68-0.79, Exp3 0.76-0.82, Exp4 0.73-0.79, Exp5 <= -0.72, Exp6 <= -0.86, Exp7 0.63-0.70, Exp8 0.42-0.53. If the retune cannot get Exp2 below ~0.80 without dropping Exp3/Exp4 below 0.72, submit the smaller step (gamma ~1.05, beta ~7.5) rather than the aggressive one \\u2014 the gate will discard anything worse than 0.0952."
