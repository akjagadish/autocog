# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_10" and "pi_9") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_10" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_9" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_10
**Chorus-Threshold Novelty Weighting, Balanced-Gradient variant (CTN-BG).**

People told the accuracies of a panel of binary expert ratings do not weight a rating by its accuracy; they weight it by how much *news* it carries, and news is loud only when it stands against a genuine CHORUS. Six commitments, all smooth and continuous (no mute band, no solo release, no discrete count switch).

**(1) The count comparator is a parameter-free gate.** Before any expert identity is consulted, an unweighted feature-wise comparison asks: does one product win on strictly more attributes? If not — equal win counts, including wholly non-discriminating displays — the display is non-diagnostic and the subject flips a mental coin: exactly 0.5, with NO validity tie-break and NO take-the-best fallback, at every panel composition and size.

**(2) Seniority is panel-relative; novelty is a smooth convex, monotonically DECREASING function of it, and the descent is STEEP.** s_j = (v_j − v_min)/(v_max − v_min); nov_j = (1 − s_j)^kappa with kappa ≈ 14–16.5. Nothing is muted by fiat and nothing is released by fiat, but the curve is sharp: only the panel's genuinely idiosyncratic BOTTOM voice speaks with nov ≈ 1; the second-from-bottom voice retains a real but small share; a mid voice essentially nothing; a star nothing at all. Novelty is never negative — a star is ignored, never counted against its own side.

**(3) THE CORE CLAIM — a novel voice is loud only in proportion to the CHORUS it speaks into, and a chorus is measured in *mid-expert equivalents*.** Each other discriminating voice contributes a subjective unit u_i = (1 + tau·s_i)/(1 + tau/2): a mid-panel voice counts as exactly one unit, a star ≈ 1.4, a bottom voice ≈ 0.6. The chorus a cue j faces is Q_j = Σ_{opposing} u_i + lam_own·Σ_{own side, i≠j} u_i — voices it contradicts counted in full, voices it merely stands beside echoed at a discount. Loudness is a smooth logistic of that chorus, g_j = Gmax·σ((Q_j − q0)/wid), with a narrow but continuous threshold at roughly two-and-a-half mid-equivalents. BOTH how many voices and how senior they are matter, in one scalar: two mid voices are not yet a chorus, two stars just barely are, three upper voices fully are.

**(4) The ungated panel gradient is THIN and only MILDLY convex — a bare ordinal pull that does not, by itself, give the panel's bottom voice an edge over a pair of mid voices.** Every discriminating cue contributes r_j = eta + c·(1 − s_j)^nu with small eta, small c and a moderate exponent nu ≈ 1.7–2.05. The scale is small enough that all-upper displays drift near chance at any count margin, and the exponent is flat enough that a single floor cue's residual is worth about the same as two mid cues' residuals — so a floor voice opposed by a mid PAIR is a dead heat (it needs the chorus gate, not the gradient, to win), while a floor voice opposed by a three-cue upper bloc is carried past chance by the gate.

**(5) Integration is Luce-like and saturating.** w_j = r_j + nov_j·g_j; E = Σ dir_j w_j; z = beta·E/((c_n + Σ_j w_j)·D^gamma). Evidence is judged relative to the total weight of evidence on the table plus a constant of indecision, and is diluted by the number of mutually discriminating attributes with gamma ≈ 1, so a lone cue and an unopposed pair of the same tier feel about equally compelling. An attention lapse epsilon mixes the result with a coin flip.

**(6) Capacity is a near-total collapse of the chorus construal past ~7 voices, with only mild extra noise.** For n > 7 the amplification essentially vanishes (Gmax × (1 − psi·(n−7))) while integration noise grows only slightly, so eight-expert star-backed majorities sit near chance rather than being reversed, and eight-expert plain tally adherence survives on the residual gradient.

**Cross-design signature:** exact chance on tally ties at any composition; near-chance on displays whose every discriminating voice is upper-band, at every margin; moderate (not ceiling) adherence to majorities containing no bottom voice; a bottom voice facing two MID voices lands at chance, facing two STARS reverses substantially, facing a three-cue upper bloc reverses to ≈.12–.18; near-ceiling following of majorities that contain the bottom voice; attenuated integration on eight-expert panels.

**Mute-Band Maverick Arbitration with a HARD (near-step) Band and a Stronger Capacity Noise Term (MBM-PG7).**

People who are told the accuracies of a panel of binary expert ratings do not weight experts *by* accuracy; they weight them by how much *news* a rating carries, and news is a steeply thresholded, panel-relative quantity. Six commitments.

**(1) The count comparator is a parameter-free gate.** Before any expert identity is consulted, an unweighted feature-wise comparison asks a purely ordinal question: does one product win on strictly more attributes? If not — equal win counts, including wholly non-discriminating displays — the display is construed as non-diagnostic and the subject flips a mental coin: exactly 0.5, with NO validity tie-break and NO take-the-best fallback, at every panel composition and size.

**(2) HARD, NEAR-STEP MUTE BAND, CHORUS-INDEPENDENT.** Seniority is read off the *displayed panel*: s_j = (v_j − v_min)/(v_max − v_min). Only voices lying within a narrow band theta (≈12-20% of the panel span) above the panel floor are heard as carrying private, surprising information, and *within* that band the listening function is now strongly convex: m_j = max(0, 1 − s_j/theta)^rho with rho ≈ 1.7-2.5. The maverick construal is therefore close to categorical — only the panel's genuinely idiosyncratic BOTTOM voice speaks with full force; a voice that merely sits low-ish (a fifth to a half of the way into the band) is already nearly as mute as a star. Muting is unconditional: a lone star cue is as mute as a star inside a bloc.

**(3) GRADED, STRONGLY ASYMMETRIC CHORUS AMPLIFICATION WITH A LATE, STEEP KNEE — and the post-knee amplification is DEEP.** A maverick's voice is loud only in proportion to the redundancy it is heard against, and redundancy is *asymmetric*: the bloc a cue CONTRADICTS is the chorus proper, while the bloc a cue sits INSIDE echoes it only weakly and therefore counts at a discount lam_own. For cue j: C_j = (m_opp − 1) + lam_own·(m_own − 1) when the cue is opposed, and C_j = (m_own − 1) when the display is unanimous. Amplification G_j = 1 + alpha·C_j^p/(C_j^p + kappa) with a LATE, STEEP knee (p ≈ 6.4, kappa ≈ 205) and a LARGE post-knee asymptote (alpha ≈ 52). Because (2) is now near-categorical, this large amplification is applied essentially only to true floor voices: a partial, mid-band voice can no longer borrow a 20-30x chorus gain and masquerade as a maverick.

**(4) THE PANEL GRADIENT: the mute band is quiet, not empty, and the listening floor is THIN.** Muted experts do not vanish; each discriminating cue contributes a residual r_j = eta + c·(1 − s_j) — a thin flat listening floor plus an inverse-seniority gradient. Displays in which no voice is inside the mute band hover near chance at any count margin, while the preserved slope still generates the anti-validity contrasts on conflict displays.

**(5) DILUTION AND LAPSE.** Net evidence E = Σ_j dir_j·(G_j·m_j + r_j) is compressed by the number of mutually contradicting cues, D^gamma, and mixed with an attention lapse epsilon.

**(6) CAPACITY IS BOTH A FLATTENING AND A SUBSTANTIAL NOISE SOURCE.** Holding the whole seniority ordering in mind is possible only up to about seven voices. For n > 7 the amplification collapses toward 1 AND integration becomes markedly noisier (divisor × (1 + chi·(n−7)) with chi now appreciably larger), so eight-expert star-backed majorities sit at chance and eight-expert plain tally adherence is systematically LOWER than the six-expert equivalent even though the tally still governs direction.

**Cross-design signature:** exact chance on tally ties at any composition; chance on displays whose every discriminating voice is upper-band, at ANY count margin; only the panel's bottom voice (not the second- or third-from-bottom) can reverse a majority; a lone floor voice opposed by a mere PAIR lands at chance while the same voice opposed by a three-cue bloc reverses it to ≈.15; near-ceiling following of dense unanimous displays and of majorities containing the floor voice; and visibly attenuated, noisy integration on eight-expert panels.

**Rationale:** GOAL: dissociate CTN-BG (advocated) from MBM-PG7 (competing). The two models are near-twins: parameter-free count gate (tally ties -> exactly 0.5), panel-relative seniority s=(v-vmin)/(vmax-vmin), a near-categorical bottom-voice 'maverick/novelty' weight, chorus-gated amplification of that voice, dilution by D^gamma, a lapse, and a capacity term past 7 voices. With one lone floor expert and everything else far above the band, their novelty/mute functions AGREE (nov=1 vs mav=1 at s=0; both ~0 for every s>=0.45, for every theta<=0.20 and every kappa in [14,16.5]). So band-shape cells are wasted. They differ on exactly ONE structural commitment that this design attacks from four directions, plus a magnitude difference in the residual gradient.

THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE. CTN-BG measures the chorus in MID-EXPERT EQUIVALENTS: Q_j = sum_opp u_i + lam_own*sum_own u_i with u=(1+tau*s)/(1+tau/2) (mid=1.00, star~1.33-1.43, floor~0.6), gated by a narrow logistic at q0~2.45 units. MBM-PG7 measures it in RAW COUNTS: base = (m_opp-1) + lam_own*(m_own-1), gated by a late steep knee (p~6.4, kappa~205) that needs base >~2.3. Hence: TWO STARS are a chorus for CTN (Q=2.63-2.86 > q0) but not for MBM (base=1 -> G=1.20-1.32); THREE MIDS are a chorus for both (Q=3.0; base=2 -> G=11.6-22.2); an UNOPPOSED 3-cue bloc containing the floor voice is a chorus for MBM (base=2) but not for CTN (own-side echo lam_own*(u_star+u_star)=1.32-2.00 < q0).

PANEL (screen order deliberately scrambled so validity rank is decoupled from position): [f0=.74, f1=.94, f2=.54, f3=.76, f4=.92, f5=.72]. vmin=.54, vmax=.94, span=.40 -> s = .50/1.00/.00/.55/.95/.45. Exactly ONE floor voice (f2=.54, s=0: nov=1 in CTN, inside MBM's band for every theta), TWO stars (s=1.00, .95: u=1.34-1.43 each), THREE mids straddling s=0.5 (.45/.50/.55, so any two of them sum to exactly 2.00 mid-equivalents and all three to exactly 3.00). n=6 keeps both models below their capacity terms, removing panel-size nuisance. 8 configurations x 2 exact A/B mirrors = 16 unique pairs x K=96//16=6 repetitions = 96 trials. Tied cues are coded sometimes 1-1 and sometimes 0-0 so the number of displayed 1s never tracks condition. No cell is tally-tied (both models would trivially return 0.5).

CELLS (A-favouring version listed; the next trial is its exact mirror). Nominal P(choose A): CTN-BG (eta=.04, c_res=.12, nu=1.88, kappa=15, tau=1.2, lam_own=.60, gmax=1.9, q0=2.45, wid=.14, c_n=2.9, beta=41, gamma=.96, eps=.12) vs MBM-PG7 (theta=.16, rho=2.1, eta=.23, c=2.0, beta=.80, gamma=.95, alpha=52, kappa=205, p=6.4, lam_own=.36, eps=.09).
C1 (T1/T2) FLOOR vs MID-PAIR (1 v 2, D=3; Q=2.00 units): A wins f2; B wins f5,f3. CTN 0.58, MBM 0.56. Low rung of the chorus ladder; both near chance.
C2 (T3/T4) FLOOR vs STAR-PAIR (1 v 2, D=3; Q=2.71 units, SAME COUNT as C1): A wins f2; B wins f1,f4. CTN 0.93, box [0.86,0.96]; MBM 0.68, box [0.62,0.75]. FLAGSHIP: the parameter boxes are DISJOINT, and the within-subject contrast C2-C1 is +0.25..+0.40 for CTN but only +0.04..+0.21 for MBM (whose only lever here is the thin star residual).
C3 (T5/T6) FLOOR vs MID-TRIO (1 v 3, D=4; Q=3.00 units, only ~0.3 units more than C2 but one more COUNT): A wins f2; B wins f5,f0,f3. CTN 0.90, MBM 0.92. SECOND KEY CONTRAST: C3-C2 is ~0.00 (range -0.05..+0.03) for CTN, because 2 stars and 3 mids are the same chorus in mid-equivalents, but +0.08..+0.33 (nominal +0.24) for MBM, whose knee sits between base=1 and base=2. C2 and C3 together are the crossed dissociation: seniority-driven (CTN) versus count-driven (MBM) amplification.
C4 (T7/T8) FLOOR+STAR-PAIR vs LONE MID (3 v 1, D=4): A wins f2,f1,f4; B wins f0. CTN 0.90 (box [0.66,0.93]); MBM 0.62 (box [0.58,0.65]). CTN's own-side echo of two stars (0.6*2.71=1.63) plus the opposing mid crosses q0; MBM's own-side echo is 0.36*2=0.72 counts, far below its knee.
C5 (T9/T10) FLOOR+MID-PAIR vs LONE STAR (3 v 1, D=4): A wins f2,f5,f3; B wins f1. CTN 0.90 (equal to C4, since 1.375+0.6*2.00 ~ 1.00+0.6*2.71), MBM 0.75. CTN predicts C4=C5; MBM predicts C5-C4 ~ +0.13 (its thick residual gradient c~2.0 makes mid companions worth far more than star companions).
C6 (T11/T12) UNANIMOUS FLOOR+STAR (2 v 0, D=2): A wins f2,f1; four ties. CTN 0.76, MBM 0.79. Deliberate near-agreement anchor that identifies each model's lapse/slope.
C7 (T13/T14) UNANIMOUS FLOOR+STAR+STAR (3 v 0, D=3): A wins f2,f1,f4; three ties. CTN 0.72 (box [0.63,0.89]) vs MBM 0.95 (box [0.93,0.98]). THIRD KEY CONTRAST, and it runs in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from C2/C4 (so no generic 'one model is more decisive' confound can explain the data): adding a second star to an unopposed bloc containing the floor voice leaves CTN flat or slightly lower (C7-C6 in [-0.06,+0.03], D-dilution offsets the sub-threshold echo) but pushes MBM from base=1 to base=2, i.e. across its knee (C7-C6 = +0.08..+0.26).
C8 (T15/T16) ALL-UPPER MID-TRIO vs LONE STAR (3 v 1, D=4, no floor voice discriminates): A wins f5,f0,f3; B wins f1. CTN 0.63, MBM 0.665. Deliberate agreement cell that is SELF-DIAGNOSTIC: TTB/one-reason would give <0.2 here and near-1.0 in C2/C7, so systematic star-following falsifies BOTH models; it also verifies that the residual gradient alone yields only moderate adherence on displays with no bottom voice.

PREDICTED PROFILE (C1..C8): CTN-BG = .58, .93, .90, .90, .90, .76, .72, .63 ; MBM-PG7 = .56, .92-ambiguous? no: .56, .68, .92, .62, .75, .79, .95, .665. They agree only on the deliberate anchors C1, C3, C6 and C8.

INTERPRETATION. A large C2-C1 jump (~+0.35) with C2 at or above 0.86 and C3 no higher than C2, C4 = C5 near 0.90, and a FLAT C6->C7 (unanimous bloc growth does nothing) uniquely support CTN-BG's mid-expert-equivalent chorus. A flat C2-C1 (~+0.1) with C2 capped near 0.70, a large C3-C2 jump (~+0.24), C5 clearly above C4 with both near 0.6-0.75, and a big C6->C7 jump to ~0.95 uniquely support MBM-PG7's count-based knee.

CONTROLS: every configuration appears in an A-favouring and a B-favouring mirror, so side bias cancels exactly; validity rank is scrambled relative to screen position; tie coding alternates 1-1/0-0 within and across cells; every trial has a strict count winner and requires reading several ratings; n=6 removes all capacity-term nuisance.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Both models agree that the panel's unique floor expert (f2, v=.54) is the only 'news' carrier, and both are parameter-free coin flips on tally ties; they differ on ONE thing: how the amplifying chorus is measured. CTN-BG measures it in mid-expert EQUIVALENTS (two stars already constitute a chorus; an unopposed own-side bloc does not), whereas MBM-PG7 measures it in RAW COUNTS with a late knee between base=1 and base=2 (two stars are NOT a chorus, but any three-cue bloc, including an unopposed one, is).

The metric is a within-subject DOUBLE contrast on the rate of choosing the option the floor voice favours:
  POS cells (opposed floor voice, chorus in seniority units but low raw count):
    C2 floor vs star-pair, C4 floor+2 stars vs lone mid, C5 floor+2 mids vs lone star.
  NEG cell (unopposed 3-cue bloc containing the floor voice, raw count 2 but only a discounted own-side echo in units):
    C7 unanimous floor+star+star.
Score = P(follow floor side | POS) - P(follow floor side | C7).

Predicted values from the design's nominal parameterisations: CTN-BG ~ 0.91 - 0.72 = +0.19; MBM-PG7 ~ 0.68 - 0.95 = -0.27. A gap of roughly 0.45-0.5 with opposite SIGNS. Crucially the two components move in opposite directions across the theories, so no generic 'one model is more decisive/noisier' confound can mimic it, and differencing two within-subject rates cancels overall lapse rate and side bias (each cell appears in exact A/B mirrors). POS pools 36 trials and NEG 12 trials per subject, keeping the per-subject binomial noise small (sd ~0.15), so with N=25 subjects the Welch contrast should be far beyond alpha=0.01.

**Rationale:** GOAL: dissociate MBM-PG7 (advocated) from CTN-BG (competing). The two models are near-twins 
oun the structural level (parameter-free count gate -> exactly 0.5 on tally ties; panel-relative seniority s=(v-vmin)/(vmax-vmin); a near-categorical bottom-voice 'maverick/novelty' weight; chorus-gated amplification of that voice; dilution by D^gamma; a lapse; a capacity term past 7 voices). With exactly ONE floor expert and every other expert at s>=0.31, their band/novelty functions agree (mav=nov=1 at s=0; both ~0 for every s>=0.31 at any theta<=0.20 or kappa>=14), so band-shape cells are wasted. They differ on exactly TWO things, and this design converts both into parametric, within-subject signatures rather than isolated cells.

DIFFERENCE 1 - HOW A CHORUS IS COUNTED. MBM measures the chorus in RAW COUNTS: base = (m_opp-1) + lam_own*(m_own-1), gated by a LATE, STEEP knee (p~6.4, kappa~205) that needs base >~2, i.e. it needs THREE opposing voices; the identity of the opposers is irrelevant to the gain and enters only through the THICK residual gradient r = eta + c(1-s) with c~2.0. CTN measures it in MID-EXPERT EQUIVALENTS: Q = sum_opp u_i + lam_own*sum_own u_i with u=(1+tau*s)/(1+tau/2), gated by a NARROW logistic at q0~2.45 with wid~0.14; hence TWO STARS (u=1.29+1.38=2.66) already constitute a full chorus while two low-upper voices (u=0.86+0.93=1.79) do not, and the identity of the opposers is everything.

THE NOVEL CORE: A FOUR-POINT SENIORITY TITRATION AT FIXED COUNT (C1-C4). A lone floor voice (f1=.52) is opposed by a PAIR whose mid-equivalent sum is titrated in four steps straddling CTN's threshold: Q = 1.79 (C1: .65+.69), 2.14 (C2: .75+.79), 2.39 (C3: .79+.89), 2.66 (C4: .89+.94). For MBM the gain is CONSTANT across all four (base = 1 -> G = 1.25 always); only the opposers' residuals shrink, producing a SHALLOW, nearly linear rise. For CTN the gate sweeps its logistic, producing a STEEP sigmoid. Nominal predictions P(choose the floor-backed option): MBM = .53, .59, .63, .67 (total rise +0.14); CTN = .49, .71, .90, .94 (total rise +0.45). C4 alone has nearly disjoint boxes (MBM [.62,.75] vs CTN [.86,.96]).

THE CROSSED CONTRAST (C4 vs C5). C5 opposes the same floor voice with a THREE-cue LOW bloc (.65/.69/.75; Q=2.82, base=2). MBM crosses its count knee (G jumps 1.25 -> 16.2) and predicts .92; CTN is already saturated at C4 and predicts .92 as well, i.e. C5-C4 = +0.25 for MBM but -0.02 for CTN. Note the two cells are matched in mid-equivalents (2.66 vs 2.82) but differ in COUNT: a seniority-driven chorus (CTN) must be flat here, a count-driven knee (MBM) must jump. C1 vs C5 (+0.39 for both) is the shared control showing the manipulation works.

DIFFERENCE 2 - OWN-SIDE ECHO (C7 vs C6). MBM's own-side term is a COUNT discounted by lam_own~0.36, so an UNOPPOSED bloc of three that contains the floor voice has base = m_own-1 = 2 and crosses the knee, whereas CTN's own-side echo of two stars is 0.6*2.66 = 1.60 mid-equivalents, far BELOW q0, so no amplification ever occurs on unanimous displays. Predictions: C7 (floor + one star, 2v0) MBM .81 / CTN .76 (deliberate near-agreement anchor); C6 (floor + two stars, 3v0) MBM .955 / CTN .72. The within-subject bloc-growth contrast C6-C7 is +0.15 for MBM and -0.04 for CTN (D-dilution wins), and it runs in the OPPOSITE direction from the C1-C4 titration, so no generic 'one model is simply more decisive' account can explain both patterns.

ANCHORS / SELF-DIAGNOSTICS. C1 (both ~chance) fixes the low rung. C8 (all-upper low trio .65/.69/.75 beats a lone .94 star; no floor voice discriminates) is a deliberate agreement cell (MBM .69 / CTN .67) that anchors slope/lapse and is self-diagnostic: TTB/WADD would give <0.2 here and near 1.0 in C4, so systematic star-following falsifies BOTH models.

PANEL: 7 experts, validities in deliberately scrambled screen order [f0=.79, f1=.52, f2=.94, f3=.65, f4=.89, f5=.75, f6=.69]; vmin=.52, vmax=.94, span=.42 -> s = .643/.000/1.000/.310/.881/.548/.405. Exactly one floor voice (f1, s=0: full maverick/novelty in both models); every other voice sits at s>=0.31, outside MBM's widest band (theta<=0.20) and with CTN novelty <=0.004, so the dissociation rests purely on the chorus rule and the residual gradient. n=7 keeps BOTH models exactly at their capacity thresholds (over=0), removing all panel-size nuisance.

DESIGN: 8 configurations x 2 exact A/B mirrors = 16 unique pairs x K = 96//16 = 6 repetitions = 96 trials. No cell is tally-tied (both models trivially return 0.5 there); every trial has a strict count winner and requires reading several ratings.

PREDICTED PROFILE (C1..C8, P(choose the focal/floor-backed option)): MBM-PG7 = .53, .59, .63, .67, .92, .955, .81, .69 ; CTN-BG = .49, .71, .90, .94, .92, .72, .76, .67.

INTERPRETATION: a SHALLOW seniority titration (<=0.15 total across C1-C4, with C4 capped near 0.70), a large count-driven jump from C4 to C5, a large jump from C7 to C6 on unanimous bloc growth, and near-ceiling C6 uniquely support MBM-PG7's raw-count knee with a thick residual gradient. A STEEP sigmoid across C1-C4 (with C3/C4 >= 0.86), a flat or negative C4->C5 step, and a flat-to-negative C7->C6 step uniquely support CTN-BG's mid-expert-equivalent chorus.

CONTROLS: every configuration appears in an A-favouring and a B-favouring mirror, so side bias cancels exactly; validity rank is scrambled relative to screen position so positional heuristics cannot mimic validity-based weighting; tied cues are coded sometimes 1-1 and sometimes 0-0 within and across cells so the number of displayed 1s never tracks condition or seniority.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The two models are near-twins except in HOW a chorus is counted, and the design converts this into two cells that move in OPPOSITE directions.

Cell A (pooled C3 and C4): a lone floor voice (f1, v=.52, s=0) opposed by a PAIR of senior voices ({f0,f4} and {f2,f4}). For MBM-PG7 the chorus is a raw count: base = (2-1) + lam_own*0 = 1, far below its late, steep knee (kappa~205, p~6.4), so the gain is a constant G=1.25 regardless of how senior the opposing pair is; the floor-backed option is chosen only ~.63-.67 of the time. For CTN-BG the chorus is in mid-expert equivalents (Q = 2.39 and 2.66), which straddles/exceeds its narrow logistic gate at q0~2.45, so the floor voice is fully amplified and the focal option is chosen ~.90-.94.

Cell B (C6): the SAME floor voice sitting inside an unanimous 3v0 bloc with two stars. Here MBM's own-side count term gives base = m_own-1 = 2, which crosses its knee (G jumps to ~16), predicting ~.955. CTN's own-side echo is 0.6*2.66 = 1.60 mid-equivalents, well below q0, so no amplification ever occurs on unanimous displays and dilution keeps it at ~.72.

The difference (pooled C3/C4 focal rate) - (C6 focal rate) is therefore predicted to be about -0.30 under MBM-PG7 and about +0.20 under CTN-BG: a gap of ~0.50 in a quantity bounded in [-1,1]. Crucially it is a WITHIN-SUBJECT difference of two rates, so side bias, lapse rate and general decisiveness cancel; no 'one model is just noisier/more decisive' account can produce the sign flip. With 24 trials feeding the first term and 12 the second per subject, the binomial contribution to between-subject variance is only ~0.013, so the contrast should be tight enough to separate the theories with 25 subjects.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

{
  "interpretation": "Across the 18 experiments a very consistent empirical picture emerges, and it is only partially matched by either theory.\n\nThe robust regularities in the real data are: (i) tally ties are exactly chance (Exp3: .474); (ii) displays whose discriminating voices are all upper-band sit at chance at ANY count margin (Exp15 .489, Exp16 .489, Exp10 .485, Exp17 solo-vs-flat \\u2248 0, Exp18 \\u2248 +.05); (iii) the panel's lowest-validity voice is enormously powerful \\u2014 a 3-cue majority opposed by the lone floor expert reverses to .145 (Exp14), and coherent-minus-conflict tally adherence is \\u2212.76/\\u2212.94 (Exp7, Exp8); (iv) overall tally adherence is moderate-to-high only when a low voice is on the majority side (.79 in Exp5, .755 in Exp6 with 8 features \\u2014 i.e. capacity attenuation is mild at most, if anything Exp6 \\u2248 Exp5).\n\nBoth pi_10 (CTN-BG) and pi_9 (MBM-PG7) capture (i)\\u2013(iii) reasonably well, because they share the count gate, panel-relative seniority, and a near-categorical bottom-voice weight. Where they were explicitly pitted against each other \\u2014 Experiments 1 and 2, both purpose-built around the CHORUS rule \\u2014 both failed, and failed in a very informative way. Exp1 observed \\u2212.017 (pi_10 predicted +.199, pi_9 predicted \\u2212.271); Exp2 observed +.015 (pi_10 +.158, pi_9 \\u2212.314). The observed contrasts are essentially ZERO in both cases, sitting between the two theories' opposite-signed predictions. Substantively: the floor voice's power does NOT scale with how senior its opposing chorus is (killing CTN-BG's mid-equivalent gate), and it is NOT further boosted by sitting inside an unopposed three-cue bloc (killing MBM-PG7's raw-count knee). The amplification appears to be essentially context-independent \\u2014 a flat, near-constant dominance of the panel's bottom voice.\n\nOn the whole corpus pi_10 is the better of the two (closer on Exp1, Exp2, Exp5, Exp7, Exp12, Exp14, Exp17, Exp18; pi_9 wins mainly on Exp6, Exp8, Exp16). pi_9 is the weaker theory and its distinctive commitments (hard step mute band; late, steep count knee with alpha\\u224852; strong capacity noise) are the ones most directly contradicted: its predicted large negative contrasts in Exp1/Exp2 were the largest single errors in the entire set, and its own-side count knee predicts a unanimous-bloc boost that simply is not there. It should be replaced, and replaced by a theory that is a genuine competitor to pi_10 rather than a cosmetic variant: one that removes chorus gating altogether.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_9 with a CHORUS-FREE, PURELY INVERSE-VALIDITY (contrarian) weighting theory \\u2014 call it e.g. 'Flat Maverick / Inverse-Seniority Normalised Integration (FM-ISN)'. Core commitments:\n\n(1) Keep the parameter-free count gate: if the two options win on equally many features (including wholly non-discriminating displays), P = exactly 0.5, no validity tie-break, no take-the-best fallback. This is required by Exp3 (.474) and is common ground.\n\n(2) Weight each discriminating cue by a STEEPLY DECREASING function of panel-relative seniority s_j = (v_j \\u2212 v_min)/(v_max \\u2212 v_min): w_j = eta + A\\u00b7(1 \\u2212 s_j)^kappa, with kappa \\u2248 4\\u201312 and A/eta large (A \\u2248 1\\u20133, eta \\u2248 0.02\\u20130.15). The floor voice carries almost all the weight; mid and star voices carry only a thin, weakly graded residual.\n\n(3) THE DECISIVE NEW CLAIM \\u2014 NO CHORUS AMPLIFICATION OF ANY KIND. The bottom voice's weight is fixed by seniority alone and is completely independent of (a) how many voices oppose it, (b) how senior those opposing voices are, and (c) whether it sits inside a unanimous own-side bloc. This is exactly what Exp1 (\\u22120.017) and Exp2 (+0.015) demand: opposed-floor cells and unanimous-bloc cells must come out at the SAME rate, and the seniority titration across an opposing pair must be FLAT. Both pi_10 (seniority-unit gate) and pi_9 (raw-count knee) are falsified here; the new theory's signature is a null on both contrasts.\n\n(4) Normalised / saturating integration so that upper-only displays land at exact chance at every margin: z = beta\\u00b7(\\u03a3 dir_j w_j)/((c_n + \\u03a3_j w_j)\\u00b7D^gamma) with gamma \\u2248 0.8\\u20131.2 and c_n chosen so that a 3v1 or 2v0 display made entirely of upper-band voices yields .48\\u2013.55 (Exp15 .489, Exp16 .489, Exp10 .485, Exp17 \\u2248 0, Exp18 \\u2248 +.05), while a floor-backed majority yields \\u2248 .80 and a 3-cue upper majority opposed by the lone floor voice reverses to \\u2248 .13\\u2013.17 (Exp14 .145).\n\n(5) Only a MILD capacity effect: at n = 8 the model must still deliver \\u2248 .75 tally adherence (Exp6) while star-backed 8-expert majorities stay at chance (Exp10). Do NOT include the strong noise inflation of pi_9, which over-flattened, nor pi_10's amplification collapse, which under-predicted Exp6 (.699 vs .755). Capacity should be at most a small slope reduction, or absent entirely.\n\n(6) A lapse epsilon (\\u2248 .05\\u2013.20) mixing with a coin flip; parameter ranges should be set so that the model reproduces Exp4 \\u2248 .65, Exp5 \\u2248 .79, Exp7 \\u2248 \\u2212.76, Exp8 \\u2248 \\u2212.9, Exp9 \\u2248 .66, Exp11 \\u2248 .41, Exp13 \\u2248 .70.\n\nThe new theory is thus a strictly simpler, strictly more task-invariant competitor to pi_10: identical on the count gate and on anti-validity dominance, but committed to a context-free maverick weight, which is the one place where pi_10 demonstrably over-predicts (Exp1 +.20 vs observed \\u2212.02; Exp2 +.16 vs observed +.02; Exp15 .571 vs observed .489)."
