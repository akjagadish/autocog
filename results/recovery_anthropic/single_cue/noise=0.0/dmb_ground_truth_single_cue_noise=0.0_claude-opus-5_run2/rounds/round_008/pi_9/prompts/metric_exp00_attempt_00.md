# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** GOAL: dissociate MBM-PG7 (advocated) from CTN-BG (competing). The two models are near-twins 
oun the structural level (parameter-free count gate -> exactly 0.5 on tally ties; panel-relative seniority s=(v-vmin)/(vmax-vmin); a near-categorical bottom-voice 'maverick/novelty' weight; chorus-gated amplification of that voice; dilution by D^gamma; a lapse; a capacity term past 7 voices). With exactly ONE floor expert and every other expert at s>=0.31, their band/novelty functions agree (mav=nov=1 at s=0; both ~0 for every s>=0.31 at any theta<=0.20 or kappa>=14), so band-shape cells are wasted. They differ on exactly TWO things, and this design converts both into parametric, within-subject signatures rather than isolated cells.

DIFFERENCE 1 - HOW A CHORUS IS COUNTED. MBM measures the chorus in RAW COUNTS: base = (m_opp-1) + lam_own*(m_own-1), gated by a LATE, STEEP knee (p~6.4, kappa~205) that needs base >~2, i.e. it needs THREE opposing voices; the identity of the opposers is irrelevant to the gain and enters only through the THICK residual gradient r = eta + c(1-s) with c~2.0. CTN measures it in MID-EXPERT EQUIVALENTS: Q = sum_opp u_i + lam_own*sum_own u_i with u=(1+tau*s)/(1+tau/2), gated by a NARROW logistic at q0~2.45 with wid~0.14; hence TWO STARS (u=1.29+1.38=2.66) already constitute a full chorus while two low-upper voices (u=0.86+0.93=1.79) do not, and the identity of the opposers is everything.

THE NOVEL CORE: A FOUR-POINT SENIORITY TITRATION AT FIXED COUNT (C1-C4). A lone floor voice (f1=.52) is opposed by a PAIR whose mid-equivalent sum is titrated in four steps straddling CTN's threshold: Q = 1.79 (C1: .65+.69), 2.14 (C2: .75+.79), 2.39 (C3: .79+.89), 2.66 (C4: .89+.94). For MBM the gain is CONSTANT across all four (base = 1 -> G = 1.25 always); only the opposers' residuals shrink, producing a SHALLOW, nearly linear rise. For CTN the gate sweeps its logistic, producing a STEEP sigmoid. Nominal predictions P(choose the floor-backed option): MBM = .53, .59, .63, .67 (total rise +0.14); CTN = .49, .71, .90, .94 (total rise +0.45). C4 alone has nearly disjoint boxes (MBM [.62,.75] vs CTN [.86,.96]).

THE CROSSED CONTRAST (C4 vs C5). C5 opposes the same floor voice with a THREE-cue LOW bloc (.65/.69/.75; Q=2.82, base=2). MBM crosses its count knee (G jumps 1.25 -> 16.2) and predicts .92; CTN is already saturated at C4 and predicts .92 as well, i.e. C5-C4 = +0.25 for MBM but -0.02 for CTN. Note the two cells are matched in mid-equivalents (2.66 vs 2.82) but differ in COUNT: a seniority-driven chorus (CTN) must be flat here, a count-driven knee (MBM) must jump. C1 vs C5 (+0.39 for both) is the shared control showing the manipulation works.

DIFFERENCE 2 - OWN-SIDE ECHO (C7 vs C6). MBM's own-side term is a COUNT discounted by lam_own~0.36, so an UNOPPOSED bloc of three that contains the floor voice has base = m_own-1 = 2 and crosses the knee, whereas CTN's own-side echo of two stars is 0.6*2.66 = 1.60 mid-equivalents, far BELOW q0, so no amplification ever occurs on unanimous displays. Predictions: C7 (floor + one star, 2v0) MBM .81 / CTN .76 (deliberate near-agreement anchor); C6 (floor + two stars, 3v0) MBM .955 / CTN .72. The within-subject bloc-growth contrast C6-C7 is +0.15 for MBM and -0.04 for CTN (D-dilution wins), and it runs in the OPPOSITE direction from the C1-C4 titration, so no generic 'one model is simply more decisive' account can explain both patterns.

ANCHORS / SELF-DIAGNOSTICS. C1 (both ~chance) fixes the low rung. C8 (all-upper low trio .65/.69/.75 beats a lone .94 star; no floor voice discriminates) is a deliberate agreement cell (MBM .69 / CTN .67) that anchors slope/lapse and is self-diagnostic: TTB/WADD would give <0.2 here and near 1.0 in C4, so systematic star-following falsifies BOTH models.

PANEL: 7 experts, validities in deliberately scrambled screen order [f0=.79, f1=.52, f2=.94, f3=.65, f4=.89, f5=.75, f6=.69]; vmin=.52, vmax=.94, span=.42 -> s = .643/.000/1.000/.310/.881/.548/.405. Exactly one floor voice (f1, s=0: full maverick/novelty in both models); every other voice sits at s>=0.31, outside MBM's widest band (theta<=0.20) and with CTN novelty <=0.004, so the dissociation rests purely on the chorus rule and the residual gradient. n=7 keeps BOTH models exactly at their capacity thresholds (over=0), removing all panel-size nuisance.

DESIGN: 8 configurations x 2 exact A/B mirrors = 16 unique pairs x K = 96//16 = 6 repetitions = 96 trials. No cell is tally-tied (both models trivially return 0.5 there); every trial has a strict count winner and requires reading several ratings.

PREDICTED PROFILE (C1..C8, P(choose the focal/floor-backed option)): MBM-PG7 = .53, .59, .63, .67, .92, .955, .81, .69 ; CTN-BG = .49, .71, .90, .94, .92, .72, .76, .67.

INTERPRETATION: a SHALLOW seniority titration (<=0.15 total across C1-C4, with C4 capped near 0.70), a large count-driven jump from C4 to C5, a large jump from C7 to C6 on unanimous bloc growth, and near-ceiling C6 uniquely support MBM-PG7's raw-count knee with a thick residual gradient. A STEEP sigmoid across C1-C4 (with C3/C4 >= 0.86), a flat or negative C4->C5 step, and a flat-to-negative C7->C6 step uniquely support CTN-BG's mid-expert-equivalent chorus.

CONTROLS: every configuration appears in an A-favouring and a B-favouring mirror, so side bias cancels exactly; validity rank is scrambled relative to screen position so positional heuristics cannot mimic validity-based weighting; tied cues are coded sometimes 1-1 and sometimes 0-0 within and across cells so the number of displayed 1s never tracks condition or seniority.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** **Mute-Band Maverick Arbitration with a HARD (near-step) Band and a Stronger Capacity Noise Term (MBM-PG7).**

People who are told the accuracies of a panel of binary expert ratings do not weight experts *by* accuracy; they weight them by how much *news* a rating carries, and news is a steeply thresholded, panel-relative quantity. Six commitments.

**(1) The count comparator is a parameter-free gate.** Before any expert identity is consulted, an unweighted feature-wise comparison asks a purely ordinal question: does one product win on strictly more attributes? If not — equal win counts, including wholly non-discriminating displays — the display is construed as non-diagnostic and the subject flips a mental coin: exactly 0.5, with NO validity tie-break and NO take-the-best fallback, at every panel composition and size.

**(2) HARD, NEAR-STEP MUTE BAND, CHORUS-INDEPENDENT.** Seniority is read off the *displayed panel*: s_j = (v_j − v_min)/(v_max − v_min). Only voices lying within a narrow band theta (≈12-20% of the panel span) above the panel floor are heard as carrying private, surprising information, and *within* that band the listening function is now strongly convex: m_j = max(0, 1 − s_j/theta)^rho with rho ≈ 1.7-2.5. The maverick construal is therefore close to categorical — only the panel's genuinely idiosyncratic BOTTOM voice speaks with full force; a voice that merely sits low-ish (a fifth to a half of the way into the band) is already nearly as mute as a star. Muting is unconditional: a lone star cue is as mute as a star inside a bloc.

**(3) GRADED, STRONGLY ASYMMETRIC CHORUS AMPLIFICATION WITH A LATE, STEEP KNEE — and the post-knee amplification is DEEP.** A maverick's voice is loud only in proportion to the redundancy it is heard against, and redundancy is *asymmetric*: the bloc a cue CONTRADICTS is the chorus proper, while the bloc a cue sits INSIDE echoes it only weakly and therefore counts at a discount lam_own. For cue j: C_j = (m_opp − 1) + lam_own·(m_own − 1) when the cue is opposed, and C_j = (m_own − 1) when the display is unanimous. Amplification G_j = 1 + alpha·C_j^p/(C_j^p + kappa) with a LATE, STEEP knee (p ≈ 6.4, kappa ≈ 205) and a LARGE post-knee asymptote (alpha ≈ 52). Because (2) is now near-categorical, this large amplification is applied essentially only to true floor voices: a partial, mid-band voice can no longer borrow a 20-30x chorus gain and masquerade as a maverick.

**(4) THE PANEL GRADIENT: the mute band is quiet, not empty, and the listening floor is THIN.** Muted experts do not vanish; each discriminating cue contributes a residual r_j = eta + c·(1 − s_j) — a thin flat listening floor plus an inverse-seniority gradient. Displays in which no voice is inside the mute band hover near chance at any count margin, while the preserved slope still generates the anti-validity contrasts on conflict displays.

**(5) DILUTION AND LAPSE.** Net evidence E = Σ_j dir_j·(G_j·m_j + r_j) is compressed by the number of mutually contradicting cues, D^gamma, and mixed with an attention lapse epsilon.

**(6) CAPACITY IS BOTH A FLATTENING AND A SUBSTANTIAL NOISE SOURCE.** Holding the whole seniority ordering in mind is possible only up to about seven voices. For n > 7 the amplification collapses toward 1 AND integration becomes markedly noisier (divisor × (1 + chi·(n−7)) with chi now appreciably larger), so eight-expert star-backed majorities sit at chance and eight-expert plain tally adherence is systematically LOWER than the six-expert equivalent even though the tally still governs direction.

**Cross-design signature:** exact chance on tally ties at any composition; chance on displays whose every discriminating voice is upper-band, at ANY count margin; only the panel's bottom voice (not the second- or third-from-bottom) can reverse a majority; a lone floor voice opposed by a mere PAIR lands at chance while the same voice opposed by a three-cue bloc reverses it to ≈.15; near-ceiling following of dense unanimous displays and of majorities containing the floor voice; and visibly attenuated, noisy integration on eight-expert panels.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** **Chorus-Threshold Novelty Weighting, Balanced-Gradient variant (CTN-BG).**

People told the accuracies of a panel of binary expert ratings do not weight a rating by its accuracy; they weight it by how much *news* it carries, and news is loud only when it stands against a genuine CHORUS. Six commitments, all smooth and continuous (no mute band, no solo release, no discrete count switch).

**(1) The count comparator is a parameter-free gate.** Before any expert identity is consulted, an unweighted feature-wise comparison asks: does one product win on strictly more attributes? If not — equal win counts, including wholly non-discriminating displays — the display is non-diagnostic and the subject flips a mental coin: exactly 0.5, with NO validity tie-break and NO take-the-best fallback, at every panel composition and size.

**(2) Seniority is panel-relative; novelty is a smooth convex, monotonically DECREASING function of it, and the descent is STEEP.** s_j = (v_j − v_min)/(v_max − v_min); nov_j = (1 − s_j)^kappa with kappa ≈ 14–16.5. Nothing is muted by fiat and nothing is released by fiat, but the curve is sharp: only the panel's genuinely idiosyncratic BOTTOM voice speaks with nov ≈ 1; the second-from-bottom voice retains a real but small share; a mid voice essentially nothing; a star nothing at all. Novelty is never negative — a star is ignored, never counted against its own side.

**(3) THE CORE CLAIM — a novel voice is loud only in proportion to the CHORUS it speaks into, and a chorus is measured in *mid-expert equivalents*.** Each other discriminating voice contributes a subjective unit u_i = (1 + tau·s_i)/(1 + tau/2): a mid-panel voice counts as exactly one unit, a star ≈ 1.4, a bottom voice ≈ 0.6. The chorus a cue j faces is Q_j = Σ_{opposing} u_i + lam_own·Σ_{own side, i≠j} u_i — voices it contradicts counted in full, voices it merely stands beside echoed at a discount. Loudness is a smooth logistic of that chorus, g_j = Gmax·σ((Q_j − q0)/wid), with a narrow but continuous threshold at roughly two-and-a-half mid-equivalents. BOTH how many voices and how senior they are matter, in one scalar: two mid voices are not yet a chorus, two stars just barely are, three upper voices fully are.

**(4) The ungated panel gradient is THIN and only MILDLY convex — a bare ordinal pull that does not, by itself, give the panel's bottom voice an edge over a pair of mid voices.** Every discriminating cue contributes r_j = eta + c·(1 − s_j)^nu with small eta, small c and a moderate exponent nu ≈ 1.7–2.05. The scale is small enough that all-upper displays drift near chance at any count margin, and the exponent is flat enough that a single floor cue's residual is worth about the same as two mid cues' residuals — so a floor voice opposed by a mid PAIR is a dead heat (it needs the chorus gate, not the gradient, to win), while a floor voice opposed by a three-cue upper bloc is carried past chance by the gate.

**(5) Integration is Luce-like and saturating.** w_j = r_j + nov_j·g_j; E = Σ dir_j w_j; z = beta·E/((c_n + Σ_j w_j)·D^gamma). Evidence is judged relative to the total weight of evidence on the table plus a constant of indecision, and is diluted by the number of mutually discriminating attributes with gamma ≈ 1, so a lone cue and an unopposed pair of the same tier feel about equally compelling. An attention lapse epsilon mixes the result with a coin flip.

**(6) Capacity is a near-total collapse of the chorus construal past ~7 voices, with only mild extra noise.** For n > 7 the amplification essentially vanishes (Gmax × (1 − psi·(n−7))) while integration noise grows only slightly, so eight-expert star-backed majorities sit near chance rather than being reversed, and eight-expert plain tally adherence survives on the residual gradient.

**Cross-design signature:** exact chance on tally ties at any composition; near-chance on displays whose every discriminating voice is upper-band, at every margin; moderate (not ceiling) adherence to majorities containing no bottom voice; a bottom voice facing two MID voices lands at chance, facing two STARS reverses substantially, facing a three-cue upper bloc reverses to ≈.12–.18; near-ceiling following of majorities that contain the bottom voice; attenuated integration on eight-expert panels.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

For MBM-PG7 the chorus is a raw count: base = (2-1) + lam_own*0 = 1, far below its late, steep knee (kappa~205, p~6.4), so the gain is a constant G=1.25 regardless of how senior the opposing pair is; the floor-backed option is chosen only ~.63-.67 of the time. For CTN-BG the chorus is in mid-expert equivalents (Q = 2.39 and 2.66), which straddles/exceeds its narrow logistic gate at q0~2.45, so the floor voice is fully amplified and the focal option is chosen ~.90-.94.\n\nCell B (C6): the SAME floor voice sitting inside an unanimous 3v0 bloc with two stars. Here MBM's own-side count term gives base = m_own-1 = 2, which crosses its knee (G jumps to ~16), predicting ~.955. CTN's own-side echo is 0.6*2.66 = 1.60 mid-equivalents, well below q0, so no amplification ever occurs on unanimous displays and dilution keeps it at ~.72.\n\nThe difference (pooled C3/C4 focal rate) - (C6 focal rate) is therefore predicted to be about -0.30 under MBM-PG7 and about +0.20 under CTN-BG: a gap of ~0.50 in a quantity bounded in [-1,1]. Crucially it is a WITHIN-SUBJECT difference of two rates, so side bias, lapse rate and general decisiveness cancel; no 'one model is just noisier/more decisive' account can produce the sign flip. With 24 trials feeding the first term and 12 the second per subject, the binomial contribution to between-subject variance is only ~0.013, so the contrast should be tight enough to separate the theories with 25 subjects."
