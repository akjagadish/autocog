# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with a *compressed-validity compensatory integration with fully relative evidence and no load sensitivity* theory. Core claims:

1. Cue weights come from stated validities but are strongly COMPRESSED toward equality: w_j ∝ (v_j - 0.5)^rho with rho well BELOW 1 (~0.3-0.8), or equivalently log-odds weights raised to a sub-linear power. This keeps a .95 cue clearly heavier than a .56 cue, but only by a factor of ~1.5-3, not the 20x that a convex exponent produces. This is what lets two mid-validity cues balance one .95 cue at ~50/50 (Exp5, Exp6: observed 0.518/0.508) while a 2-3 cue majority wins at 0.78-0.84 (Exp4, Exp7, Exp8) — i.e. behaviour that looks 'tally-like' without being unit-weight tallying.

2. Evidence is read FULLY relatively: E = sum_j w_j d_j / sum_j w_j |d_j| (normalised per trial by the total discriminating weight only). Consequence, and a hard commitment: any trial with exactly one discriminating cue sits at the same high plateau regardless of that cue's validity — no single-cue validity ladder (Exp2 observed -0.20, flat-to-slightly-reversed; pi_5's psi<1 cannot produce this). Confidence depends on the BALANCE of conflicting weight, not on the absolute mass of evidence.

3. NO load machinery of any kind: features on which both options are endorsed (or both unendorsed) are simply dropped; they change neither the weights nor any corroboration bonus. Predicted load contrast = 0 exactly (Exp1 observed 0.053).

4. Screen position enters only as a WEAK additive attention bonus to the first (and optionally last) listed cue — a multiplier of order 1.1-1.4, not the dominant geometric gradient of pi_3. It must be small enough that a mid-list .95 cue still competes on equal terms with the two screen extremes (Exp5/Exp6 ~0.5) and that no subject is locked to a screen extreme.

5. Individual differences are UNIMODAL jitter in the compression exponent rho (from near-tally, rho~0.2, to moderately validity-sensitive, rho~1.0), in beta and in lapse — explicitly NO primacy/recency subpopulations. This matches the moderate between-subject variances observed everywhere (0.006-0.05) rather than the near-zero variances pi_3 produces.

6. Choice = logistic(beta * E) with lapse epsilon; beta should be tuned so that |E| near 1 gives ~0.82-0.88 (not 0.95+, cf. Exp7/Exp8 observed 0.82/0.84) and |E| near 0.3-0.4 gives ~0.60-0.65, so graded conflicts land in the observed 0.5-0.85 band.

Optionally allow a small negative sensitivity term or per-subject idiosyncratic column attention to accommodate the mildly *reversed* single-cue ladder in Exp2 (-0.20) — but the central prediction must be 'flat, not ascending'. This theory differs from pi_5 by discarding load-gating, supra-additive corroboration and partial normalisation, and by inverting the diagnosticity exponent from convex to concave; it differs from pi_3 by making validity, not screen position, the causal driver, by demoting position to a weak multiplier, and by removing the primacy/recency bimodality.

The next discriminating experiment should pit compressed-but-real validity weighting against pure relative-tallying (e.g. graded k-vs-1 conflicts where the single cue's validity is varied from .60 to .95 at fixed cue counts), since both current theories collapse there.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**Read-until-sufficient integration with silence-calibrated evidence.**

People do not run a fixed heuristic (TTB, tally, or weighted-additive). They read the expert ratings in the order the screen presents them, accumulate weighted differences, and stop as soon as their running lead is safe from any single expert they have not read yet. Four claims:

1. **Cue weights = stated diagnosticity x a modest reading-position bonus.** w_j = ((v_j-0.5)/0.5)^rho * (1 + alpha*exp(-j/tau) + gamma*exp(-(n-1-j)/tau)), with rho ~1.25-1.75 (diagnosticity read close to, slightly steeper than, linear in v-0.5 -- never lexicographic) and alpha ~0.7-1.2 (the first-listed rating gets roughly twice the attention of a mid-list rating; recency is negligible). Position is an attention multiplier, not a search order and not the causal driver: a .95 expert placed mid-list still outweighs a .78 expert placed first.

2. **Serial reading with a graded sufficiency stop.** After each rating that actually *discriminates*, the reader performs a best-case reversal check: could any single not-yet-read expert still overturn the current lead? The bar is theta = phi * max weight among the unread positions, and stopping is graded, q = sigmoid(s*(|E|/theta - 1)). This is the only place where screen order has structural force, and it is *display-contingent*: in a validity-sorted display the first cue clears the bar immediately and behaviour looks like Take-The-Best (in conflict AND agreement cells alike, so the TTB-vs-tally contrast collapses to ~0); when the best expert sits mid-list or last, the bar stays high, the reader keeps going, and behaviour becomes compensatory and tally-looking.

3. **Evidence is read FULLY relatively, and there is no load machinery of any kind.** R = sum(w*d)/sum(w*|d|) over the cues read so far. A stop therefore always carries |R| = 1 (a categorical conclusion), while an exhausted read carries a diluted R (graded hesitation). Confidence depends on the *balance* of the conflicting weight actually considered, never on the absolute mass of evidence, and features on which both products are endorsed (or both unendorsed) are simply dropped -- they change no weight and add no corroboration bonus, so any contrast between 'dense' and 'sparse' displays with identical difference patterns is exactly zero.

4. **Silence calibration (the novel claim): who stayed silent is evidence about how big the quality gap is.** Validity is treated as sensitivity: an insensitive (low-validity) expert only notices large quality differences, a highly sensitive one notices marginal ones. Hence a difference announced by a weak expert implies a *big* latent gap and is acted on confidently, whereas a difference visible only to a top expert while everybody else sees no difference implies a *marginal* gap and is acted on hesitantly. Formally the read-out gain is multiplied by c = 1 - eta*(fraction of silent experts)^q*(weighted mean diagnosticity of the speaking experts), clipped to be positive. Because of the power q~2.7 this bites only when silence is overwhelming, i.e. on one- and two-cue displays; it is nearly inert once half the panel speaks. Its signature is a *reversed* single-cue ladder: lone .56 or .62 experts are followed more often than lone .72 or .95 experts.

5. **Choice** = logistic(beta * c * R) with lapse epsilon; beta ~2.5, so a fully one-sided balance gives ~0.90 and graded conflicts land in the 0.5-0.85 band. Individual differences are unimodal jitter in rho, alpha, phi, s, beta, eta and lapse -- no strategy subpopulations, no primacy/recency reader types, and no learning across trials (there is no feedback to learn from).

`rationale`:
**What I kept from the arbiter, and where I deliberately deviate.** I adopt four of the arbiter's five prescriptions verbatim: (a) *fully relative* evidence, R = sum(w*d)/sum(w*|d|), so decisiveness reflects the balance of conflicting weight rather than the mass of evidence; (b) *no load machinery of any kind* -- shared endorsements are dropped, so the load contrast is exactly 0 (target 0.053, with huge between-subject variance = noise around zero); (c) *screen position only as a weak multiplicative attention bonus* (first cue ~1.9x a mid-list cue, no dominant geometric gradient, no subject ever locked to a screen extreme); (d) *unimodal jitter only* -- no primacy/recency subpopulations, no strategy types. I also take up the arbiter's optional invitation to produce the mildly **reversed** single-cue ladder (-0.20) rather than a flat one.

I deviate on one point, with reason: the arbiter demands a strongly *concave* diagnosticity exponent (rho ~0.3-0.8), which makes the model near-tally. But the arbiter's own diagnosis never addresses the validity-sorted-display experiment whose TTB-vs-tally contrast is +0.093 -- essentially zero. A near-tally compensatory model predicts about -0.6 there (exactly what the pure-tally theory pi_2 scored, -0.69) and every purely compensatory theory that has been tried lands at -0.19 to 0.0 only by accident. A contrast of zero *requires* that on a sorted display the leading cue is followed just as often when it opposes the majority as when it agrees with it. Strong compression cannot deliver that; nor can a steep positional gradient without destroying the two 'chance-level' experiments (0.518 and 0.508). So I keep a mildly super-linear diagnosticity (rho ~1.5) and instead recover the sorted-display TTB signature from a *mechanism* rather than from the weights: the best-case reversal check ('can any single expert I have not yet read still overturn my lead?'). This check is display-contingent -- it fires instantly when the display is validity-sorted (TTB-looking) and never fires when the best expert sits mid-list or last (compensatory, tally-looking) -- which is precisely the dissociation the eight experiments show between the sorted display and the scrambled ones. This is the one component of pi_4 that demonstrably worked (it is why pi_4 matched four experiments at once: -0.005/0.093, 0.786/0.775, 0.520/0.518, 0.491/0.508), and discarding it, as both pi_3 and pi_5 did, is what forced those theories to trade those four experiments away.

**How the three failures of the previous theories are repaired.** (i) pi_5's catastrophic load contrast (0.805 vs 0.053) and pi_5's supra-additive corroboration are gone -- with no load term and identical difference patterns across load cells the prediction is exactly 0. (ii) pi_4's collapse on the two 'extremes-beat-the-mid-list-top-cue' experiments (0.35/0.82 and 0.33/0.84) is repaired by the position attention bonus interacting with the stopping rule: when the first-listed cue is itself reasonably diagnostic, its weight clears the bar set by the best unread expert, the reader stops, and the relative evidence is a full +/-1 -- yielding ~0.8 rather than pi_4's ~0.35; when the first cue is weak relative to a mid-list .95 the bar is never cleared, reading continues, and the weighted margin comes out near zero -- preserving the two chance-level cells. (iii) The single-cue validity ladder, which every previous theory got wrong in sign or size (+0.33, +0.27, +0.01 vs -0.20), is produced by the new **silence-calibration** term: validity is read as *sensitivity*, so a difference that only the sharpest expert detects while the whole panel is otherwise silent implies a marginal quality gap and is discounted, whereas a difference an insensitive expert notices implies a large gap. Because the discount scales with (fraction silent)^~2.7 it is essentially inert once half the experts speak, so it changes nothing in the multi-cue conflict cells while turning the lone-expert ladder negative by roughly the observed -0.20.

**Experiment-invariance.** Every ingredient is defined from quantities the experiment itself supplies (n_features, validities, the trial's rating vectors) and none is tuned to a particular design: the same parameters give TTB-looking behaviour on sorted displays, majority-following on scrambled ones, chance-level balance when two mid cues face one near-oracle, a zero load contrast, and a reversed lone-expert ladder.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1121 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1121.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Fit quality is uneven but mostly good. The candidate nails the two things previous theories broke on: Exp8's reversed single-cue ladder (-0.219 vs -0.203 observed \\u2014 the silence-calibration term is the only mechanism in the pool that gets the sign right; pi_4/pi_5 gave +0.27/+0.34) and Exp7's zero load contrast (-0.033 vs +0.053, well inside the huge between-subject variance of 0.049), which kills pi_5's catastrophic +0.805. Exp2 (0.720 vs 0.775), Exp3 (0.476 vs 0.518) and Exp4 (0.450 vs 0.508) are all within ~0.06 and preserve the 'chance-level' cells that pi_1/pi_2/pi_3 blow up. Exp1's TTB-vs-tally contrast is 0.007 vs 0.093 \\u2014 slightly flat but the right order of magnitude, and far better than pi_2/pi_5. Between-subject variances (0.003-0.03) are in the observed band, so the unimodal-jitter commitment looks right.\n\nThe clear residual failures are Exp6 (0.608 vs 0.841, a 0.23 miss) and Exp5 (0.714 vs 0.820, a 0.11 miss). Both are cells where a numerical majority of mid/low-validity cues opposes a single mid-list top-validity cue, and in both cases the candidate is systematically too respectful of the lone .95 expert. This is a direct consequence of the one place the candidate deviated from the arbiter's prescription: rho was kept mildly CONVEX (1.25-1.75) instead of concave (0.3-0.8). With rho~1.5 the .95 cue carries roughly (0.9/0.44)^1.5 \\u2248 3x a .72 cue and ~15x a .56 cue, so on unsorted displays where the sufficiency-stop never fires the fully-relative R lands near 0 and choice sits near 0.5-0.6, exactly the observed shortfall. Note also that this deviation is not what is buying Exp1: the reversal-check stop is what produces the ~0 TTB contrast there, and compression would if anything make the first (attention-boosted) cue clear the bar MORE readily on validity-sorted displays, i.e. Exp1 should hold or improve.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED and the architecture is worth building on \\u2014 keep the read-until-sufficient stopping rule, the fully-relative R, the no-load commitment, the weak positional multiplier and the silence-calibration term exactly as they are (they are what fixed Exp7 and Exp8 and kept Exp1/Exp3/Exp4 near target). The one change I want is the in-family knob the arbiter already prescribed and the proposer overrode: move the diagnosticity exponent from convex toward concave. Take a measured step rather than the full jump \\u2014 rho in [0.85, 1.20] (not 0.3) \\u2014 so a .95 cue is still ~1.5-2x a .72 cue but can be outvoted by two or three of them. That is the direct, mechanistically-identified cause of the two remaining misses (Exp6 0.61 vs 0.84; Exp5 0.71 vs 0.82), which together dominate the residual loss. Two guardrails while doing this: (a) re-check Exp3 and Exp4 \\u2014 compression pushes the two screen-extreme cues to beat the mid-list .95, so if Exp3 drops much below ~0.44 trim alpha to ~0.6-0.9 to keep the position bonus from compounding the compression; (b) re-check Exp1 \\u2014 with flatter weights the first-listed cue clears the phi*max-unread bar more easily on the sorted display, so if the contrast overshoots past ~0.15 raise phi slightly (toward 1.15-1.25) rather than touching rho again. If a modest beta increase (2.6-3.1) is needed to lift the majority cells into the 0.80-0.86 band once weights are compressed, that is fine, but do it after rho, not instead of it. Do not alter the silence-calibration exponent/eta \\u2014 Exp8 is currently the best fit in the whole pool and is fragile."
