# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_10`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_7`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_7`).

Replace pi_7 entirely. Do NOT keep the sharp silence sigmoid, the categorical unanimity bonus, the saturating majority bonus, or the absolute high-gain read-out \u2014 each of these is directly contradicted by an observed null or reversal (Exp 1, 2, 9, 18) or by systematic over-decisiveness (Exp 4, 13, 14, 17).\n\nProposed new theory ('Ordinal-Tally with Rarity Discount and a Hard Noise Ceiling'):\n1. COMPRESSED / ORDINAL DIAGNOSTICITY. A discriminating expert contributes w_j that depends mainly on its RANK among the validities actually displayed, not on the numeric validity: e.g. w_j = w_lo + (w_hi - w_lo) * (rank_j/(n-1))^gamma with w_hi/w_lo ~ 1.5-2.5 only. This makes a .95 expert worth only ~1.5-2 cheap experts, so that two-or-three-cue coalitions beat one or two heavyweights (Exp 8 = .84, Exp 12 = .85, Exp 4 = .775, Exp 14 = .665) while a single strong cue still ties two weak ones (Exp 5 = .52, Exp 11 = .49). Crucially there is NO oracle premium and NO steep validity gradient.\n2. NUMEROSITY IS THE MAIN DRIVER, BUT GRADED AND NON-CATEGORICAL: add lambda * (k_A - k_B) with no saturation switch and no unanimity step; this reproduces the near-linear increase in majority-following without predicting the jumps that Exp 2 refuted.\n3. RARITY / SENSITIVITY GAP INFERENCE IS THE ONLY CONFIDENCE TERM, and it is attached to the SPEAKING cues, not to the silent fraction: when the discriminating evidence is carried by high-validity (high-sensitivity) experts only, the inferred quality gap is small, so the drive is multiplied by a factor decreasing in the mean validity of the speakers. This is what produces the robust -0.20 in Exp 10 and it should be the ONLY mechanism that touches confidence. There must be NO dependence on the fraction or composition (1,1 vs 0,0) of mute rows, since every silence-composition contrast observed is ~0 (Exp 1, 2, 9, 18).\n4. NO EDGE SALIENCE / NO SERIAL STOP RULE, or at most a very small primacy weight on the top row (|effect| < 3 points), since Exp 5, 6, 11 are all at chance and Exp 15 (.353) shows subjects do NOT follow the first discriminating row.\n5. HARD NOISE CEILING: the final probability is p = 0.5 + (p_raw - 0.5) * (1 - eps) with eps ~ 0.25-0.35 applied UNIFORMLY (not difficulty-scaled), so that even landslide displays top out near .85 \u2014 matching the observed .775-.85 asymptote and killing the .95+ predictions pi_7 kept making.\nParameter ranges should be chosen so that, at central values, the model predicts ~0.00 for the Exp 1 dense-minus-sparse metric, ~0.00 for the Exp 2 composite, ~0.80-0.85 for Exp 8/12, ~0.75 for Exp 4, ~0.50 for Exp 5/6/11, and ~-0.20 for Exp 10. This theory is sharply distinguishable from pi_10 (which retains relative normalisation, an oracle premium, steep edge salience, a smooth silence discount and a top-down commitment stop), so future experiments can contrast 'validity is read ordinally and silence is ignored' against 'validity has a top-end premium and silence dilutes confidence'.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Gap-Inference Tally (GIT). Choice is a weighted count of reasons: (i) each discriminating expert contributes w_j = ((v_j-0.5)/0.5)^rho with rho ~1.3-1.75 (smooth, no oracle premium, no knee), so one .95 expert is worth about two upper-middling experts; (ii) numerosity is a separate, strictly linear, non-saturating, non-categorical reason lam*(k_A-k_B) with no unanimity step; (iii) the ONLY confidence term is rarity/sensitivity gap-inference attached to the SPEAKERS: c = max(1 - eta*f_mute^q*s_bar_speakers, c_min), so a difference noticed only by highly sensitive experts while the panel is mute implies a tiny quality gap and is acted on hesitantly (this alone produces the reversed single-cue ladder); (iv) mute rows are almost composition-blind (mutual endorsement ~ mutual abstention, omega close to 1) so all silence-composition contrasts are ~0 and lone-oracle displays floor in both compositions (no oracle reversal); (v) screen position enters ONLY as a tie-breaker licensed by an exact deadlock in the number of reasons, confined to the literal first and last rows, with a narrow Gaussian gate and no residual, and there is no serial stop rule and no first-cue commitment; (vi) evidence is read relative to the evidence on the table and the final probability passes through a hard, difficulty-independent noise ceiling p = 0.5 + (p-0.5)*(1-eps), eps ~0.3, so nothing is ever more decisive than ~.83 or less than ~.17.

`rationale`:
pi_7 failed for four separable reasons and each is removed here. (a) Its sharp silence sigmoid plus categorical unanimity and saturating-majority bonuses made it systematically over-decisive: Exp 2 .851 vs .775, Exp 12 .778 vs .665, Exp 11 1.15 vs .513, Exp 18 .31 vs -.03. GIT replaces all three with ONE linear numerosity reason and a smooth power-law mute-fraction term, and then passes everything through a hard, difficulty-independent noise ceiling (eps ~ .32) so that even landslides top out near .83 and hopeless displays bottom out near .17 - which is exactly the empirical envelope (.775, .84, .85 at the top; .30, .353 at the bottom). (b) Its absolute high-gain read-out is replaced by a read-out relative to the speaking evidence, which further prevents the 0.95+ predictions on multi-cue landslides. (c) Its authority-checked first-cue commitment is deleted outright, because Exp 13 (.353) shows subjects follow the topmost discriminating row LESS than chance. (d) Diagnosticity now has no categorical top-end premium: a smooth exponent rho ~1.5 on (v-0.5)/0.5 places one .95 expert at almost exactly the strength of two upper-middling experts, which is what makes the three 'two mid cues vs one heavyweight' contrasts (Exp 3 .518, Exp 4 .508, Exp 9 .490) all land at chance instead of pi_7's .45/.42/.46 drift. The rarity/sensitivity discount is retained as the SOLE confidence mechanism, since it is the only account of the robust reversal in Exp 8 (-.2025, a lone .56 expert beats a lone .95 expert); with eta large enough that lone-heavyweight displays hit the floor in BOTH mute compositions, it simultaneously predicts ~0 oracle reversal and a small positive silence cliff, matching Exp 16 (+.097) while leaving Exp 17 (-.001) and Exp 18 (-.033) at ~0 - precisely the three cells pi_7 got wrong (+.235, +.330, +.310). I deviate from the arbiter on two points with explicit justification. First, I retain a position term, but only as a tie-breaker gated on an EXACT deadlock in reason counts, confined to the literal first and last rows, with no residual: every observation the arbiter cited against position (Exp 3, 4, 9) is a 2-vs-1 display where my narrow gate is already off, whereas the exactly tied displays (Exp 10 = .85 for the two WEAKEST experts against .95+.86; Exp 12's deadlock cell; Exp 5 = .82) are unreachable by any validity-monotone weighting, ordinal or otherwise; deleting position would put Exp 10 near .25, an error far larger than the one it saves. Second, I keep omega slightly below 1 because Exp 7 (+.053) and Exp 16 (+.097) are both small positives, i.e. mutual endorsement is a slightly weaker form of silence than mutual absence; keeping omega near .7 (rather than pi_7's .82 with a step function) yields effects of the right small size rather than the large composition effects pi_7 produced.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1800 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1800.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

But the fit is broken in one huge place and mis-scaled in a cluster of others.\n\n(1) Exp 1 is catastrophic: real +0.093, candidate -0.493 \n this is the largest single residual in the set, and it directly violates the arbiter's own stated target (~0.00 on this metric). The metric is TTB-follow-rate on conflict cells minus on agreement cells. The candidate's conflict cells are being decided almost entirely by the raw count term lam*(kA-kB): with lam=0.23 and five features, a 1-vs-4 or 2-vs-3 display gives N = -0.7 to -0.23, which swamps the weighted-diagnosticity term V even when the lone speaker is the .95 expert (w=.85 vs four cheap cues summing ~.3). So the model follows the tally at the ceiling (~.83) on conflict cells and at the ceiling on agreement cells, producing a difference near -(1-2*eps) instead of ~0. Note that Exp 2 (the metric the lam term was tuned to) does NOT require lam at all: in Exp 2's conflict cells the tally side always carries .9/.8/.7 experts, so the weighted sum alone already prefers the coalition. lam is therefore over-fit to a cell that does not need it and is destroying Exp 1.\n\n(2) A second, separable mis-calibration: the 'two screen-extreme cues beat one mid-list heavyweight' cells are all systematically under-predicted because the edge term is gated to fire only at an EXACT deadlock. Exp 6 (.542 vs .841), Exp 10 (.652 vs .850), Exp 3 (.450 vs .518), Exp 4 (.391 vs .508), Exp 9 (.378 vs .490) are all cells with |kA-kB| = 1 or 2, where sigma=0.45 switches the anchor term essentially off. Every one of these residuals has the same sign, which is a calibration signature, not noise.\n\n(3) A third cluster shows residual over-sensitivity to evidence MASS: Exp 17 (+0.153 vs -0.001) and Exp 18 (+0.100 vs -0.033) both say the candidate is more decisive on dense/high-mass displays than on sparse ones, whereas humans are flat. The k2+W normalisation is not flattening enough, and the linear lam*dk term re-introduces exactly the mass sensitivity the arbiter wanted removed. Exp 11 (0.948 vs 0.513) is the same story in composite form: c8 (three mid cues vs one oracle) is too high, again a numerosity artefact.\n\nEncouragingly, all three diagnoses point the same way on the shared parameters: shrinking lam and moving the coalition-vs-heavyweight work from the raw count into the (widened) extreme-row term would push Exp 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17 and 18 all toward the data simultaneously.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Stay inside the prescribed family (weighted/compressed diagnosticity tally + linear numerosity + speaker-rarity confidence + uniform noise ceiling) \n this is a retune, not a redesign. Three concrete, mutually consistent knobs:\n\n1. CUT THE NUMEROSITY TERM HARD. lam is the proximate cause of the Exp 1 blow-up (-0.49 vs +0.09). Drop the range to roughly [0.03, 0.12] (centre ~0.07). Verify that Exp 2 stays at ~.775 \n it should, because in Exp 2 the tally side already wins on weighted diagnosticity alone (.9+.8+.6 vs a lone .95), so nothing is lost. This same change pulls Exp 12 (.733 -> .665), Exp 11 (.948 -> ~.5, via c8), Exp 18 (+.10 -> ~0) and Exp 17 (+.15 -> ~0) toward the data. Keep rho in [1.4, 2.0] so the .95 expert retains enough weight to win Exp 1's small-margin conflict cells once lam is small.\n\n2. WIDEN AND STRENGTHEN THE EXTREME-ROW TERM so it survives |kA-kB| = 1-2 instead of only an exact deadlock: sigma -> [0.85, 1.40], mu -> [0.75, 1.15]. This is the mechanism that has to carry the 'two screen extremes beat one mid-list heavyweight' cells once lam is reduced: Exp 6 (.542 -> ~.84), Exp 10 (.652 -> ~.85), Exp 3 (.450 -> ~.52), Exp 4 (.391 -> ~.51), Exp 9 (.378 -> ~.49). Note that this also resolves the apparent Exp 1 / Exp 6 tension: Exp 1's conflicts are top-row-singleton displays where the extremes split or cancel, while Exp 6's are displays where BOTH extremes back the coalition \n the position term, not the raw count, is what should distinguish them. Keep it confined to the literal first and last rows with no residual, as now.\n\n3. FLATTEN EVIDENCE-MASS SENSITIVITY a little further for Exp 17/18: either raise k2 to [0.55, 0.95] or normalise the drive by W alone (plus a small floor) rather than k2+W, so dense landslide displays are not systematically more decisive than sparse ones. Leave eps in [0.30, 0.38]; do not raise it further, since Exp 5 (.82), Exp 10 (.85) and Exp 6 (.84) all need the ceiling to stay near .83.\n\nOne faithfulness note: the candidate uses a smooth power weighting with an effective .95:.56 weight ratio of ~15-20x, far steeper than the arbiter's prescribed compressed/ordinal ratio of 1.5-2.5. Do NOT compress toward 1.5-2.5 \n that would make Exp 1 worse \n but do state the weighting explicitly as a graded (non-ordinal) diagnosticity within the family, and rely on the lam cut plus the anchor term (not weight compression) to keep the multi-cue coalition cells where the data put them. Everything else (no unanimity step, no silence-composition dependence, no serial stop rule, speaker-sensitivity as the sole confidence term, uniform noise ceiling) should be kept exactly as it is \n those parts are already fitting well."
