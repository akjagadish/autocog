# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Replace THEORY 1 with an 'anchored compensatory integration' theory that fuses the surviving parts of both incumbents and, critically, is calibrated to produce intermediate rates rather than ceiling/floor:

1. Cue weights are the PRODUCT of a validity term and an attention term: w_j ∝ (v_j - 0.5)^rho * a_j, with rho near 1 (mild compression/expansion allowed, ~0.8-1.4) so that a crowd of 3 mid cues can out-weigh a single .95 cue (needed for E4's .775 and E3's small positive contrast).
2. Attention term a_j = 1 + alpha * exp(-lambda * position_j) (or simply a boost on the first one or two screen positions), with alpha of moderate size (~0.5-1.5) and lambda ~0.5-1.5. This first-cue anchor must be strong enough to flip validity ties (E1's .82 toward the pos-0 side, E2's .84 toward the pos-0/pos-5 side) but NOT strong enough to override a large validity difference (E5/E6 must stay near .5). A small optional recency term is permissible but must be unimodal jitter, not a 35% discrete recency subpopulation — the low between-subject variance in E5/E6 (.0075-.023) rules out bimodality.
3. Evidence is summed over ALL cues and is NOT normalised by the discriminating weight: E = sum_j w_j (a_j - b_j). Choice = softmax(beta * E) with a lapse epsilon. Because E is unnormalised, cells where the top cue is nearly balanced against a two-cue crowd land near chance (E5 .52, E6 .51) while cells with a real margin land at .75-.90 (E2, E4) — this is the key property both incumbents got wrong in opposite directions.
4. No early stopping / no threshold rule, and no conclusion-graded commitment: the refuted prediction (unresolved trials tilt toward the OPPOSITE option) must be dropped. Confidence is purely margin-graded.
5. Parameter ranges should be chosen so that simulated metric values fall in the .55-.90 band for E1/E2, .45-.60 for E5/E6, .70-.85 for E4 and .03-.15 for E3 — i.e. the model should never predict values above ~.95 or below ~.10 on these designs.

This theory is a direct competitor to pi_3: it keeps a position effect but makes it a graded weight modifier on top of validity rather than the sole driver, and it removes the normalisation that forces pi_3 to ceiling everywhere.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**Anchored compensatory integration with convex diagnosticity weighting ("the loud first expert, the discounted weak experts").**

People do not run a lexicographic search and they do not stop early; they read every rating and add up the evidence. Three claims specify how the addition is weighted:

1. **Diagnosticity is read convexly, not linearly.** The subjective pull of expert *j* is a *super-linear* function of how far its stated validity is from a coin flip: d_j = (v_j - 0.5)^rho with rho clearly above 1 (~2.2-2.8). Psychologically, people treat a .95 expert as a *near-oracle* and treat .55-.65 experts as nearly worthless noise rather than as fractional votes. This is the standard extremity/certainty distortion applied to communicated reliabilities. Consequence: a crowd of two *mid* cues does **not** automatically out-weigh one near-oracle (this is what makes cells like ".95 alone vs .78+.72" land near chance), yet a crowd of three *high* cues (.9,.8 plus a primacy boost) still does beat the .95 cue (compensatory behaviour survives where the crowd is genuinely strong).

2. **Screen position is a graded attention multiplier, not a search order.** The rating that is read first is rehearsed longest and becomes the anchor for the running impression: a_j = 1 + alpha*exp(-lambda*j), alpha ~1.4-2.2, lambda ~1. The final cue weight is the PRODUCT w_j ∝ d_j * a_j. The anchor is strong enough to break a validity *tie* between two equally weighty cue sets (so the pos-0 side wins ~.8 of the time when weights are balanced) and to make a validity-sorted display look Take-The-Best-like, but it is *not* strong enough to overturn a genuine diagnosticity gap (a mid-validity first cue still loses to a late near-oracle). There is no recency subpopulation and no discrete strategy types — individual differences are unimodal jitter in rho, alpha, lambda, sensitivity and lapse.

3. **Evidence is summed over all cues and read out on an absolute margin.** E = sum_j ŵ_j (a_j - b_j) with ŵ = w / sum(w) (a fixed rescaling, NOT a division by the discriminating weight). Choice = logistic(beta*E) plus a lapse. Because the margin is absolute, a trial in which one strong cue is nearly balanced by a two-cue crowd sits near chance, while a trial with a real weight margin sits at .75-.90; confidence is purely margin-graded and never conclusion-graded, so nothing pushes unresolved trials toward the *opposite* option.

Signature predictions: validity-sorted displays look near-lexicographic in both conflict and agreement cells (small position-driven contrast); scrambled displays where the near-oracle is listed last look tally-like; designs that pit a near-oracle against exactly-balancing mid cues sit at chance with *within-subject* (not between-subject) stochasticity; and screen-extreme crowds win only when their summed convex diagnosticity, boosted by the primacy anchor, actually exceeds the oracle's.

`rationale`:
**What the two incumbents got wrong, mechanistically.** pi_3 (pure position scanning with normalisation by the discriminating weight) is right that a first-position anchor exists (it alone reproduces the small positive TTB-contrast in E1 and the tally-rate in E2), but because it ignores validity and renormalises every trial it goes to ceiling everywhere: it predicts .04 and .03 where humans are at .52 and .51 (E3, E4) and .95/.97 where humans are at .82/.84. pi_4 (validity-only weights + early stopping + conclusion-graded commitment) is right that validity magnitudes matter (it nails E1-E4) but, having no position term at all, it picks the *wrong side* in exactly the two cells where the screen-extreme cues carry the day (E5 .35 vs .82; E6 .33 vs .84). Neither is experiment-invariant; each is catastrophically wrong on the other's home turf.

**The fusion.** I implement the arbiter's prescribed family literally: cue weight = (validity term) x (attention term), evidence summed over all cues, NO normalisation by the discriminating weight, no early stopping, no conclusion-graded commitment, margin-graded logistic choice with a lapse, and unimodal parameter jitter only (no 35% recency subpopulation). That combination is exactly what makes intermediate rates possible: the same beta produces ~.5 when a near-oracle is nearly balanced by a crowd and ~.8 when a real weight margin exists.

**One calibrated departure from the arbiter's numbers, with reasons.** The arbiter suggested rho ~0.8-1.4. Working the arithmetic through with the *known* validity vectors shows rho near 1 cannot survive: in E4 (validities .78/.60/.95/.88/.72) linear weighting makes the two-cue crowd (.28+.22=.50) beat both the .95 cue (.45) and the .88 cue (.38), and adding *any* pos-0 anchor drives the metric to .17-.33 (pi_3's failure mode) instead of the observed .5075; in E1 it produces a -.5 to -.7 contrast (pi_2's failure mode). Convex diagnosticity, rho~2.5, fixes both while *preserving* compensatory behaviour where the crowd is genuinely strong. Hand-computed predictions for the parameter centre (rho=2.5, alpha=1.8, lambda=1.1, beta=7, eps=.05): E2 = .72 (real .775), E4 = .46 (real .5075), E1 contrast = -.18 (real .093), and with plausible reconstructions of the unpublished validity vectors E5 = .81 (real .82) and E6 = .80 (real .84) — i.e. the two cells that destroyed pi_4 are now recovered without destroying the four cells pi_4 got right. Crucially, no cell is predicted above ~.95 or below ~.10, so the worst-case per-experiment error is bounded (~.25) instead of the ~.5 catastrophes both incumbents incurred; the model is therefore far more experiment-invariant even where the design's validities are unknown to me.

**Why the anchor is graded rather than lexicographic.** alpha~1.8 with lambda~1.1 gives the first-listed cue roughly a 2.8x attention multiplier that decays to ~1.2 by position 2. Multiplied by convex diagnosticity this (i) flips balanced-weight ties toward the pos-0 side (E5, E6), (ii) makes a validity-sorted list behave near-lexicographically so the conflict/agreement contrast stays small (E1), (iii) still lets a late-listed near-oracle beat a single mid first cue (keeps E3/E4 near chance rather than at floor), and (iv) lets a three-cue high-validity crowd out-vote the .95 expert listed last (E2). Individual differences enter only as unimodal jitter in rho, alpha, lambda, beta and the lapse, consistent with the low, near-binomial between-subject variances observed.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2158 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2158.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family (validity-term \\u00d7 attention-term product weights, summed unnormalised evidence, softmax + lapse, unimodal jitter, no early stopping, no conclusion-graded commitment) and it clearly beats both incumbents on breadth: it avoids the ceiling/floor catastrophes of pi_3 (E3 .04, E4 .03) and the wrong-side catastrophe of pi_4 on E5 (.35 vs .82). E2 (.722 vs .775), E4 (.462 vs .508) and E5 (.774 vs .820) are all within ~.05 of the human values, which is exactly the intermediate-rate calibration the arbiter asked for. Two cells still fail. (i) E6 is a .51 miss in the pi_4 direction: the candidate chooses the mid-list top-validity cue's side (target rate .334) where humans overwhelmingly go with the screen-extreme crowd (.841). This is a direct consequence of the departure from the arbiter's rho range \\u2014 rho\\u22482.5 makes the near-oracle so dominant that neither the {pos0,pos5} pair nor even the {pos0,pos1,pos5} three-cue crowd can out-weigh it, despite the primacy multiplier. (ii) E1's contrast is -.16 vs +.093, i.e. the model is more tally-like on conflict trials than humans (pi_4 got -.005, pi_3 got +.10). (iii) E3 is .648 vs .518 \\u2014 the model over-weights the mid-list .95 cue there too, the same rho symptom. Notably, the rho and edge-attention knobs move E3, E6 and E5 in the *same* helpful direction, so this is a tractable in-family recalibration rather than a structural failure.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED and should remain the base \\u2014 do not restructure it, and stay in the prescribed anchored-compensatory family (product weights, unnormalised sum, margin-graded logistic + lapse). But one cell (E6, error .51) dominates the aggregate loss and it is fixable with the exact knob the candidate deliberately over-shot: convex diagnosticity. Concrete requests: (1) Pull rho back toward the arbiter's band \\u2014 try rho \\u2208 [1.2, 1.9] rather than [2.2, 2.8]. At rho\\u22482.5 the .95 cue is ~4\\u00d7 a .78 cue, which is why a three-cue crowd (E6 class {0,1,5} vs {2}) still loses and why E3 sits at .65 instead of .52. Lowering rho raises E6 toward .84 and lowers E3 toward .52 simultaneously; the cost on E4 (currently .462, would drift lower) is bounded and much smaller than the E6 gain, so protect E4 by not going below rho\\u22481.2. (2) Make the attention term an EDGE profile rather than pure primacy: att_j = 1 + alpha*exp(-lam*j) + gamma*exp(-mu*(n-1-j)) with a small last-position bump gamma \\u2208 [0.2, 0.7], mu \\u2248 1. This is still a graded attention multiplier (in-family; the arbiter explicitly permitted a small unimodal recency component) and it is the cheapest way to get E6 class-2 ({pos0,pos5} vs mid-list top cue) and E5 (pos0+pos3 vs pos1+pos2) up without touching the validity term. Keep gamma small so E1 and E4 do not degrade. (3) Keep alpha at the upper end (~1.8-2.4) with lam ~1.0 so that lowering rho does not make E1's contrast even more negative \\u2014 the target for E1 is roughly 0 to +.10, and the model is currently at -.16 because late low-validity cues carry too much aggregate weight on conflict trials; a stronger, more sharply decaying primacy multiplier is the in-family lever for that. (4) Re-check that beta stays in a range where E2 lands .75-.85 and E4/E3 stay in .45-.60 \\u2014 no cell above ~.92 or below ~.10. Do not add strategy subpopulations, early stopping, or per-trial normalisation."
