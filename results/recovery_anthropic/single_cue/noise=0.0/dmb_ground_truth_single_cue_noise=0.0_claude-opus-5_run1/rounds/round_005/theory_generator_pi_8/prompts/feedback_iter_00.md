# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_6`).

Replace pi_6 entirely. Do NOT re-tune SSI-DS+: its description commits to gamma~0.9 with exp(lam*j) recency dominance, which is sign-wrong on every monotone-validity design (Exp 2, Exp 12) and cannot be rescued by parameters.

Proposed replacement u2014 'TTL-RD: Take-The-Least-Valid with RANK-based geometric discounting and conflict-scaled noise'. Core claims:
(1) Subjects order the printed experts by validity and treat the LEAST valid discriminating expert as the decisive voice (the 'newsworthy dissent' intuition, same direction as MDSC-NV, so it reproduces Exp 2/3/5/6/12 correctly).
(2) CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE 1 u2014 weighting is by RANK, not by the numeric value of (1-v): w for the r-th least-valid discriminating cue is phi^r with phi ~ 0.30-0.50. Hence only the ORDER of the printed validities matters, not the size of the gaps. This makes sharp, opposite predictions to MDSC-NV in designs where two doubtful rows are numerically close but rank-separated (e.g. .55 vs .68, or the .945/.950/.955 families), and it predicts identical behaviour for designs that differ only in how far apart the labels are printed.
(3) CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE 2 u2014 evidence SUMS over ranks with the geometric discount: E = sum_r sign_r * phi^r, p(A) = sigmoid(beta*E). With phi < 0.5 the top-ranked cue normally wins, but a large coalition of lower-ranked cues can overturn it when the margin is big (1-vs-5 displays). This is exactly the regime where the real Exp 1 value (.593) sat BELOW pi_7's near-argmax prediction (.683), so the new theory should fit Exp 1 better while still matching Exp 2.
(4) CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE 3 u2014 NO null-verdict capture: non-discriminating rows are strictly irrelevant. All the pull toward chance comes from a conflict-scaled lapse g = 1-(1-eps0)*rho^min(nA,nB) that depends on the number of OPPOSED cues only (not on total display size), which lets dominance displays stay high (Exp 7 = .743) while conflict displays compress. This is a direct, testable clash with MDSC-NV claim (3).
(5) Ties in the printed labels (gap < .002) collapse adjacent experts into a single rank, broken by reading position (later = decisive); this reproduces the exact-chance 1-1 result of Exp 8 and the high late-low-validity adherence of Exp 10/11 (target ~.78-.82, i.e. slightly more deterministic than pi_7 achieved).
Parameter ranges: phi 0.25-0.55, beta 2-6, eps0 0.05-0.30, rho 0.55-0.90, plus a small position tiebreak weight. The next experiment can then be designed to pit rank-based vs magnitude-based doubt (numerically close but rank-distinct doubtful rows) and to test null-verdict capture directly by holding the discriminating rows fixed while silencing/unsilencing the globally most doubtful expert.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**DTV-RG — Doubt-Triggered One-Reason with Rank-Geometric weighting.**

Four claims about how people use printed expert validities.

**(1) Rank-geometric evidence, decided from the LEAST valid dissenting expert.** On each trial the subject lines the *discriminating* rows up in order of printed validity, least valid first, and sums their verdicts with a geometric discount: E = Σ_r s_r · φ^r, where r = 0 for the least valid discriminating expert and s_r = ±1 is its verdict. p(A) = σ(βE). Only the ORDER of the printed labels enters, never the size of the gaps: a .004 difference between two doubtful labels is as decisive as a .40 difference. This is why displays whose doubtful rows are separated only by .004–.005 (the .955/.950/.945 and .958/.954/.950 families) are still resolved almost deterministically in favour of the strictly least valid dissenter, and why coalitions of more valid experts normally buy nothing.

**(2) NEW — the discount rate is set by the ABSOLUTE doubtfulness of the decisive voice, not by rank alone.** One-reason choice is a *reaction to a near-chance expert*: a dissent voiced by someone who is barely better than a coin flip is a strange, newsworthy fact that has to be adjudicated on its own, and it seizes the decision. If, however, every discriminating expert is respectable, no verdict is newsworthy, nothing captures the decision, and the subject falls back on near-equal weighting of the rows. Formally φ = φ_lo + (φ_hi − φ_lo)·σ((v₀ − v_c)/w) where v₀ is the validity of the least valid DISCRIMINATING expert, φ_lo ≈ .25 (near take-the-least), φ_hi ≈ .88 (near tally), v_c ≈ .575 and w ≈ .015 (a sharp trigger: 'basically a coin flip' is a categorical judgement, not a graded one). Sharp, falsifiable predictions that no previous theory in this corpus makes: (i) two 1-vs-1 conflicts with identical rank structure but shifted absolute level — {.53 vs .97} and {.90 vs .95} — yield very different adherence (≈ .85 vs ≈ .61), even though a rank rule says they are the same display and a magnitude/doubt-ratio rule says the first should differ from {.55 vs .85} (it does not); (ii) adding a genuinely near-chance expert (v ≤ .55) to a display of respectable experts flips the whole display from compensatory to one-reason, even when that expert is not the one that decides the sign; (iii) the trigger depends on the least valid DISSENTING expert only — silencing or unsilencing a doubtful row that gives both products the same rating changes nothing.

**(3) NO null-verdict capture.** Non-discriminating rows are strictly irrelevant, whatever their validity. All pull toward chance comes from load, not from silent doubtful experts — a direct clash with MDSC-NV's claim (3).

**(4) Label-degeneracy gate and load lapse.** The doubt ordering presupposes that each printed validity picks out one expert. If any label is repeated (gap < .002) the columns are interchangeable, the ordering is unavailable, and choice collapses to an unweighted row tally — an exact coin flip on 1-1 splits (ties inside the ordering are otherwise broken by reading position, later = decisive). Independently, the more rows disagree the more often the subject loses the thread: p(guess) = 1 − (1−ε₀)·ρ^(m−2), which compresses many-row displays (including unanimous ones) toward chance. No feedback is given, so the rule is stationary across the block.

`rationale`:
I implement the arbiter's prescribed family (rank-based take-the-least with geometric discounting, evidence SUMMED over ranks, conflict/load lapse, NO null-verdict capture, degeneracy handling for repeated labels) but add the one mechanism that hand-simulation showed the pure rank rule cannot supply, and which also fixes the two experiments where the incumbent pi_7 is worst (Exp 11 err .091, Exp 2 err .056).

Why pure TTL-RD is not enough (worked through by hand on all 12 designs): with a single discount phi the model predicts the SAME adherence for every 1-vs-1 conflict regardless of validity level. The data are strongly graded by the absolute doubtfulness of the least-valid dissenter: {.53 vs .97} (Exp 4) -> .85, {.538 vs .958} (Exp 9) -> .82, {.545 vs .955} (Exp 8) -> ~.77, {.6 vs .93} (Exp 2, implied by p_tally - p_ttb_tie = .174) -> ~.6-.66, {.90 vs .95} and {.93 vs .99} (Exp 11, Exp 10) -> near .5-.6. Crucially this is NOT a gap/magnitude effect (the .55-vs-.85 pair in Exp 11 behaves like the .53-vs-.97 pair, and the .004 gaps of Exp 8/9 are resolved decisively, which kills every normalized doubt-weighting account), it is an ABSOLUTE-LEVEL effect: the one-reason mode is triggered only by an expert who is essentially a coin flip. I therefore make phi a sharp logistic function of v0, the validity of the least-valid discriminating expert (phi ~ .25 one-reason below ~.575, phi ~ .88 near-tally above ~.60). This is a new, testable claim that clashes with both pi_7 (which says doubt magnitude enters only through a near-argmax softmax over ALL rows) and with pure TTL-RD (which says only rank matters).

Hand-computed metric values with the midpoint parameters (real in brackets): Exp1 .284 [.282], Exp2 .187 [.174], Exp3 .291 [.286], Exp4 .145 [.150], Exp5 .74 [.743], Exp6 .50 [.507], Exp8 .770 [.770], Exp9 .758 [.819], Exp10 .441 [.418], Exp11 .637 [.593], Exp12 .291 [.261]. Sum of squared errors ~.0074 versus ~.0154 for pi_7 on the same eleven, with the largest single gains exactly where the arbiter diagnosed failure (Exp 11: .637 vs pi_7's .683; Exp 2: .187 vs .230; Exp 10: .441 vs .388; Exp 6: .500 vs .482), and no experiment worse than pi_7 by more than .015.

I deviate from the arbiter on two points, with reasons. (a) The lapse exponent stays (m-2) rather than min(nA,nB): with a min-based lapse the dominance displays of Exp 5 (real .743) force eps0 ~ .5, which then caps every conflict display near .70 and makes Exp 8/9 (real .77/.82) unreachable; the m-based form fits both. (b) Near-tied labels are NOT collapsed by rank (.004-.005 gaps are resolved, as Exp 8/9's high adherence requires); only exactly repeated labels (< .002) trip the degeneracy gate, which is what produces the exact-chance 1-1 result of Exp 6 (.507) that a position-tiebreak rank rule would miss by ~.3.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0377 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0377.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "DTV-RG is an impressively tight fit across the corpus and is clearly faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family (rank-ordered take-the-least, geometric discount summed over ranks, no null-verdict capture, degeneracy gate for repeated labels). Eight of twelve experiments are matched to within ~0.02: Exp1 .289/.282, Exp2 .184/.174, Exp3 .286/.286, Exp4 .142/.150, Exp6 .511/.507, Exp7 .456/.438, Exp8 .769/.770, Exp12 .268/.261. Crucially it keeps the sign-correct behaviour on the monotone-validity designs (Exp 12 at .27 vs pi_6's .74) that the arbiter flagged, and it fixes pi_7's two worst cells (Exp11 .630 vs pi_7 .683 against real .593; Exp2 .184 vs pi_7 .230 against real .174) without breaking anything else. The doubt-trigger on phi(v0) is doing real work: it is what lets the .53-.55 dissent families (Exp4/8/9) be near-deterministic while the respectable-dissent families (Exp10/11) drift toward chance.\n\nThe residuals are now concentrated in the LAPSE term, not in the core evidence rule, and they have a coherent structure. The model is too noisy where displays are unanimous or where the doubt is extreme (Exp5 dominance .699 vs .743; Exp9 .753 vs .819), and not noisy enough where conflict is genuine but doubt is mild (Exp10 .446 vs .418; Exp11 .630 vs .593). That is exactly the signature of a lapse driven by the wrong variable: the current g = 1-(1-eps0)*rho^(m-2) charges the same compression to a 6-0 dominance display as to a 3-3 conflict display, so eps0 has to be pushed to ~.25 to cover conflict cases and that drags the dominance cell down ~.04. Exp9 is partly irreducible (its near-twin Exp8 is hit exactly at .770 while real Exp9 is .819, and every other theory including pi_7 also under-shoots Exp9), so I would not chase it hard.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED and the core mechanism should be kept unchanged \"u2014 do NOT redesign the evidence rule, the rank-geometric sum, the phi(v0) doubt trigger, or the degeneracy gate, and do not drift out of the arbiter's rank-based take-the-least family. The only thing I want changed is the lapse, which is currently mis-parameterised and is the sole source of the remaining structured error.\n\nConcrete minor adjustment: factor the lapse into a load term and a conflict term, g = 1 - (1-eps0) * rho_m^max(m-2,0) * rho_c^min(nA,nB). Suggested ranges: eps0 0.08-0.18 (down from .22-.28), rho_m 0.85-0.95 (up from .75-.79, i.e. much gentler pure-load compression), rho_c 0.72-0.88. This (i) lifts the unanimous displays of Exp5 (min(nA,nB)=0, so almost no lapse beyond eps0) from .699 toward the observed .743 and should also help Exp9, and (ii) restores/increases compression precisely on the balanced-conflict trials that dominate the Exp10/11 metrics, pulling .446->~.42 and .630->~.60. Note the proposer's objection to the arbiter's pure min(nA,nB) lapse was that it makes Exp5 unreachable \"u2014 the hybrid above answers that objection while keeping a conflict-sensitive component, so it is worth one re-fit rather than dismissing the idea.\n\nGuardrails for the re-fit: Exp8 (.770), Exp12 (.261), Exp3 (.286) and Exp1 (.282) are currently near-perfect and are the experiments that discriminate this family from pi_6/pi_3 \"u2014 verify they move by <0.02. If the conflict term starts eating into Exp8, compensate with a small increase in beta (5.5-7) rather than by re-widening phi_lo. Also consider tightening v_crit/v_width only if Exp11 remains high after the lapse change; the trigger is currently sharp (w=.015) and moving v_crit below .545 would destabilise Exp8/9, so leave v_crit in [0.565, 0.580]."
