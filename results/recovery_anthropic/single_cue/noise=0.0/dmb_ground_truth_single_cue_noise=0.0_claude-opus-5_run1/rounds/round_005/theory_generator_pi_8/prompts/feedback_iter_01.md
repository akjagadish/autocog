# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_6`).

Replace pi_6 entirely. Do NOT re-tune SSI-DS+: its description commits to gamma~0.9 with exp(lam*j) recency dominance, which is sign-wrong on every monotone-validity design (Exp 2, Exp 12) and cannot be rescued by parameters.

Proposed replacement u2014 'TTL-RD: Take-The-Least-Valid with RANK-based geometric discounting and conflict-scaled noise'. Core claims:
(1) Subjects order the printed experts by validity and treat the LEAST valid discriminating expert as the decisive voice (the 'newsworthy dissent' intuition, same direction as MDSC-NV, so it reproduces Exp 2/3/5/6/12 correctly).
(2) CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE 1 u2014 weighting is by RANK, not by the numeric value of (1-v): w for the r-th least-valid discriminating cue is phi^r with phi ~ 0.30-0.50. Hence only the ORDER of the printed validities matters, not the size of the gaps. This makes sharp, opposite predictions to MDSC-NV in designs where two doubtful rows are numerically close but rank-separated (e.g. .55 vs .68, or the .945/.950/.955 families), and it predicts identical behaviour for designs that differ only in how far apart the labels are printed.
(3) CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE 2 u2014 evidence SUMS over ranks with the geometric discount: E = sum_r sign_r * phi^r, p(A) = sigmoid(beta*E). With phi < 0.5 the top-ranked cue normally wins, but a large coalition of lower-ranked cues can overturn it when the margin is big (1-vs-5 displays). This is exactly the regime where the real Exp 1 value (.593) sat BELOW pi_7's near-argmax prediction (.683), so the new theory should fit Exp 1 better while still matching Exp 2.
(4) CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE 3 u2014 NO null-verdict capture: non-discriminating rows are strictly irrelevant. All the pull toward chance comes from a conflict-scaled lapse g = 1-(1-eps0)*rho^min(nA,nB) that depends on the number of OPPOSED cues only (not on total display size), which lets dominance displays stay high (Exp 7 = .743) while conflict displays compress. This is a direct, testable clash with MDSC-NV claim (3).
(5) Ties in the printed labels (gap < .002) collapse adjacent experts into a single rank, broken by reading position (later = decisive); this reproduces the exact-chance 1-1 result of Exp 8 and the high late-low-validity adherence of Exp 10/11 (target ~.78-.82, i.e. slightly more deterministic than pi_7 achieved).
Parameter ranges: phi 0.25-0.55, beta 2-6, eps0 0.05-0.30, rho 0.55-0.90, plus a small position tiebreak weight. The next experiment can then be designed to pit rank-based vs magnitude-based doubt (numerically close but rank-distinct doubtful rows) and to test null-verdict capture directly by holding the discriminating rows fixed while silencing/unsilencing the globally most doubtful expert.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**DTV-RG/CL — Doubt-Triggered one-reason with Rank-Geometric weighting, under a two-component (load + conflict) leak and a DECISIVE degenerate-label tally.**

The evidence rule is unchanged from the accepted base; two claims about *how the rule degrades* are sharpened.

**(1) Rank-geometric evidence, decided from the LEAST valid dissenting expert.** On each trial the subject lines the *discriminating* rows up in order of printed validity, least valid first, and sums their verdicts with a geometric discount: E = Σ_r s_r · φ^r (r = 0 for the least valid discriminating expert, s_r = ±1 its verdict); p(A) = σ(βE). Only the ORDER of the printed labels enters, never the size of the gaps, which is why the .955/.950/.945 and .958/.954/.950 families are still resolved almost deterministically in favour of the strictly least valid dissenter, and why coalitions of more valid experts normally buy nothing (though a large enough coalition can still overturn one doubtful voice).

**(2) The discount rate is set by the ABSOLUTE doubtfulness of the decisive voice.** One-reason choice is a *reaction to a near-chance expert*: φ = φ_lo + (φ_hi − φ_lo)·σ((v₀ − v_c)/w), with v₀ the validity of the least valid DISCRIMINATING expert, φ_lo ≈ .25 (take-the-least), φ_hi ≈ .88 (near tally), v_c ≈ .575, w ≈ .015. Below the trigger the display is settled by one strange dissent; above it nothing is newsworthy and the rows are weighted nearly equally.

**(3) No null-verdict capture.** Non-discriminating rows are strictly irrelevant whatever their validity; all pull toward chance comes from the leak in (4).

**(4) NEW — the leak has TWO separable sources, and dominance displays leak only through the first.** Losing the thread is driven (i) by sheer display load — how many rows have to be held while the ordering is run — and (ii) independently by *opposition*: every additional row that argues the other way adds a fresh occasion to lose track of which side one was on. p(guess) = 1 − (1−ε₀)·ρ_m^max(m−2,0)·ρ_c^min(n_A,n_B), with ρ_m ≈ .79 (load) and ρ_c ≈ .97 (opposition). The two terms are close to orthogonal in the corpus: unanimous (dominance) displays have min(n_A,n_B)=0 and therefore leak only by load, so they stay well above the balanced-conflict displays of the same size, whereas a 3-vs-3 display of six rows is markedly noisier than a 6-vs-0 display of six rows. This is a direct, testable clash both with a pure-load leak (which charges a 6-0 display exactly what it charges a 3-3 display) and with a pure-opposition leak (which would make unanimous displays near-perfect).

**(5) NEW — when labels are degenerate the fallback tally is DECISIVE, not tepid.** The doubt ordering presupposes that each printed validity picks out one expert. If any label is repeated (gap < .002) the columns are interchangeable and choice collapses to an unweighted row tally — but that tally is used with a steep slope (κ ≈ 1.6, not ≈ 0.85): having nothing else to go on, the subject commits hard to the vote margin. Hence 1-vs-1 splits under duplicated labels are an exact coin flip (no anti-validity, no recency), while 2-vs-0 and 4-vs-0 splits under duplicated labels are chosen at ~.83 and ~.95 before the leak — which is what keeps unanimous displays high and what makes a 2-vs-1 display under duplicated labels clearly favour the majority rather than hovering near chance.

No feedback is given, so the rule is stationary across the block.

MINIMAL DIFF on the accepted base: (i) the lapse line becomes g = 1-(1-eps0)*rho_m^max(m-2,0)*rho_c^min(nA,nB) exactly as the critic prescribed (one extra factor, one extra parameter, nothing else in `predict` touched); (ii) the ranges of eps0/rho_m/rho_c are re-fit; (iii) tally_kappa is raised from [0.60,1.10] to [1.30,1.90]. The evidence rule, the rank-geometric sum, the phi(v0) doubt trigger and the degeneracy gate are untouched, per the critic's instruction.

Diagnosis behind the kappa move (the critic's residuals had a hidden cause). I back-solved the base model trial-by-trial and found that Exp 5 and Exp 7 are DEGENERATE-LABEL designs: with the base parameters the degenerate branch reproduces the reported values to three decimals (Exp5 hand-value .699 vs reported .6987; Exp7 .455 vs .4564), whereas the non-degenerate branch would have given .738 / much higher. So the two experiments the critic flagged as 'too noisy' are NOT governed by the lapse at all in the way assumed - they are governed by tally_kappa, which at ~0.85 makes a 2-0 unanimous display only sigmoid(1.7)=.85 confident before any lapse. Raising kappa to ~1.6 lifts Exp5 from .699 to ~.745 (real .743) and simultaneously pulls Exp7 from .456 to ~.434 (real .438) - it fixes BOTH of the critic's structured residuals with one parameter, and it cannot disturb Exp6 (whose metric trials are 1-1 splits, exactly .5 for any kappa).

Why I still adopt the conflict factor but keep it mild (rho_c ~ .965 rather than .72-.88). Exp 4 pins the 2-cue conflict retention at q(2,1)=P*rho_c=.733 (real .150 = .5-.477q) and Exp 3 pins the 4-cue/2-opposed retention at q(4,2)=P*rho_m^2*rho_c^2=.455; together these force rho_m^2*rho_c=.62, so a strong conflict term (rho_c<.9) can only be bought by pushing rho_m toward 1, which then makes 5- and 6-row displays too clean and blows up Exp 2 (+.03). A mild rho_c is what the data support: it buys the dominance-versus-conflict dissociation the critic wanted (min(nA,nB)=0 displays leak only by load) without breaking the two experiments that pin the leak. Hand-computed values with the midpoint parameters (real in brackets): Exp1 .280 [.282], Exp2 .191 [.174], Exp3 .288 [.286], Exp4 .150 [.150], Exp5 .745 [.743], Exp6 .50 [.507], Exp7 .434 [.438], Exp8 .768 [.770], Exp9 .753 [.819], Exp10 .448 [.418], Exp11 .625 [.593], Exp12 .267 [.261]; SSE ~.0066 versus ~.0090 for the accepted base, with the gains concentrated exactly where the critic diagnosed failure (Exp5 -.044 -> +.002, Exp7 +.018 -> -.004) and the four discriminating cells (Exp1, Exp3, Exp8, Exp12) all moving by <0.01 as demanded. Exp9 is left alone, per the critic's advice that it is irreducible (its near-twin Exp8 is hit exactly while real Exp9 sits .05 higher). I also verified that the critic's expectation for Exp10 is sign-inverted - its model value .446 is BELOW .5, so extra conflict noise would push it up toward .5, away from the real .418; keeping rho_c mild avoids that regression.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0377 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0195 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0195.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: DTV-RG is an impressively tight fit across the corpus and is clearly faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family (rank-ordered take-the-least, geometric discount summed over ranks, no null-verdict capture, degeneracy gate for repeated labels). Eight of twelve experiments are matched to within ~0.02: Exp1 .289/.282, Exp2 .184/.174, Exp3 .286/.286, Exp4 .142/.150, Exp6 .511/.507, Exp7 .456/.438, Exp8 .769/.770, Exp12 .268/.261. Crucially it keeps the sign-correct behaviour on the monotone-validity designs (Exp 12 at .27 vs pi_6's .74) that the arbiter flagged, and it fixes pi_7's two worst cells (Exp11 .630 vs pi_7 .683 against real .593; Exp2 .184 vs pi_7 .230 against real .174) without breaking anything else. The doubt-trigger on phi(v0) is doing real work: it is what lets the .53-.55 dissent families (Exp4/8/9) be near-deterministic while the respectable-dissent families (Exp10/11) drift toward chance.

The residuals are now concentrated in the LAPSE term, not in the core evidence rule, and they have a coherent structure. The model is too noisy where displays are unanimous or where the doubt is extreme (Exp5 dominance .699 vs .743; Exp9 .753 vs .819), and not noisy enough where conflict is genuine but doubt is mild (Exp10 .446 vs .418; Exp11 .630 vs .593). That is exactly the signature of a lapse driven by the wrong variable: the current g = 1-(1-eps0)*rho^(m-2) charges the same compression to a 6-0 dominance display as to a 3-3 conflict display, so eps0 has to be pushed to ~.25 to cover conflict cases and that drags the dominance cell down ~.04. Exp9 is partly irreducible (its near-twin Exp8 is hit exactly at .770 while real Exp9 is .819, and every other theory including pi_7 also under-shoots Exp9), so I would not chase it hard.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED and the core mechanism should be kept unchanged "u2014 do NOT redesign the evidence rule, the rank-geometric sum, the phi(v0) doubt trigger, or the degeneracy gate, and do not drift out of the arbiter's rank-based take-the-least family. The only thing I want changed is the lapse, which is currently mis-parameterised and is the sole source of the remaining structured error.

Concrete minor adjustment: factor the lapse into a load term and a conflict term, g = 1 - (1-eps0) * rho_m^max(m-2,0) * rho_c^min(nA,nB). Suggested ranges: eps0 0.08-0.18 (down from .22-.28), rho_m 0.85-0.95 (up from .75-.79, i.e. much gentler pure-load compression), rho_c 0.72-0.88. This (i) lifts the unanimous displays of Exp5 (min(nA,nB)=0, so almost no lapse beyond eps0) from .699 toward the observed .743 and should also help Exp9, and (ii) restores/increases compression precisely on the balanced-conflict trials that dominate the Exp10/11 metrics, pulling .446->~.42 and .630->~.60. Note the proposer's objection to the arbiter's pure min(nA,nB) lapse was that it makes Exp5 unreachable "u2014 the hybrid above answers that objection while keeping a conflict-sensitive component, so it is worth one re-fit rather than dismissing the idea.

Guardrails for the re-fit: Exp8 (.770), Exp12 (.261), Exp3 (.286) and Exp1 (.282) are currently near-perfect and are the experiments that discriminate this family from pi_6/pi_3 "u2014 verify they move by <0.02. If the conflict term starts eating into Exp8, compensate with a small increase in beta (5.5-7) rather than by re-widening phi_lo. Also consider tightening v_crit/v_width only if Exp11 remains high after the lapse change; the trigger is currently sharp (w=.015) and moving v_crit below .545 would destabilise Exp8/9, so leave v_crit in [0.565, 0.580].

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0377 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0195 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "The iter-2 candidate is a very tight, experiment-invariant fit and it is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family (rank-ordered take-the-least, geometric discount summed over ranks, no null-verdict capture, degeneracy gate for repeated labels). The two changes I asked for last round \\u2014 factoring the lapse into a load term and an opposition term, and re-fitting the fallback tally slope \\u2014 were implemented as a minimal diff and cut the aggregate loss almost in half (.0377 -> .0195, ACCEPTED). The two structured residuals I diagnosed are gone: Exp5 dominance went .699 -> .739 (real .743) and Exp7 .456 -> .438 (real .438), and crucially the four family-discriminating cells moved by <0.01 as demanded (Exp1 .284/.282, Exp3 .294/.286, Exp8 .770/.770, Exp12 .270/.261). Per-experiment absolute errors are now: Exp1 .002, Exp2 .003, Exp3 .008, Exp4 .010, Exp5 .003, Exp6 .004, Exp7 .000, Exp8 .000, Exp12 .009, Exp10 .019, Exp11 .030, Exp9 .056. The sign-critical behaviour on the monotone-validity designs is preserved (Exp12 .27 vs pi_6's .74; Exp2 .178 vs pi_7's .230), and Exp11 (.623 vs pi_7's .683) is still much closer to the real .593 than the parent theory.\n\nThe only non-trivial residual left is Exp9 (.7625 vs .8189). Exp9 is structurally a near-twin of Exp8 (validity ladders .958/.546/... vs .955/.545/...; in both, the strictly least valid row is also the last-read row, so the model's decisive voice and the metric's salience argmax coincide). The model hits Exp8 exactly while the human value in Exp9 sits .05 higher, and every competing theory under-shoots Exp9 too (pi_7 .771, pi_6 .736, pi_4 .709). That pattern says the gap is between-experiment/sample variability in the humans, not a missing mechanism the rank-geometric family can see. Worse, the remaining knobs are anti-correlated: Exp9 is a conflict-display metric, so any increase in the opposition leak (rho_c down) or any widening of v_width that would pull Exp10 (.437 -> .418) and Exp11 (.623 -> .593) toward the data would simultaneously push Exp9 further below its already-low value and start eroding the exact Exp8 hit. The candidate is sitting at a genuine local optimum of the prescribed family.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "Ship this candidate. It was ACCEPTED by the gate at loss .0195, it stays inside the arbiter's rank-based take-the-least family with no drift, and 11 of 12 experiments are matched within ~0.03 (9 of 12 within 0.01). The mechanisms are all earning their keep: the phi(v0) doubt trigger separates the near-chance-dissent families (Exp4/8/9, near-deterministic) from the respectable-dissent families (Exp10/11, drifting toward chance); the two-component load x opposition leak now simultaneously supports high dominance adherence (Exp5 .739) and compressed conflict displays; and the decisive degenerate-label tally keeps Exp5/Exp7 consistent without touching Exp6's 1-1 coin flip. The single remaining outlier, Exp9, is shared by every theory in the corpus and its exact structural twin (Exp8) is fit perfectly, so it reads as irreducible between-experiment human variation rather than a mechanism gap. Further tuning is now a zero-sum trade: the only levers that would lower Exp10/Exp11 (stronger rho_c conflict leak, wider v_width, lower beta) push Exp9 further down and jeopardise the exact Exp8/Exp7/Exp5 fits, so an additional round would most likely be rejected by the gate or overfit. Any future work is better spent on a NEW experiment that pits rank-based against magnitude-based doubt (numerically close but rank-distinct doubtful rows) and that tests the load-vs-opposition leak dissociation directly (6-0 vs 3-3 displays of equal size), since those are the claims this candidate makes that no rival currently matches."
