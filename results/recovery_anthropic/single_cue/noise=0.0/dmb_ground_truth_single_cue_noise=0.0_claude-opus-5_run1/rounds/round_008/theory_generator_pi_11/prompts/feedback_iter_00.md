# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_10`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_7`).

Replace pi_7 (MDSC-NV) entirely. Its two signature claims are falsified: (a) 'coalitions buy nothing / near-argmax relative doubt' is refuted by Exps 1 (.49), 15 (.55), 16 (.47) and by Exp 2's C-term; (b) the raw display-length lapse rho^(m-2) is refuted by the flat, high anchor-follow rates on long displays (Exp 2 T-term, Exps 17/18).

Propose instead a RELATIVE-SHARE GATING theory — call it SSG (Salience-Share Gating) — that is a strong competitor to pi_10 rather than a weak one:

1. Row salience over DISCRIMINATING rows only: s_j = (1-v_j)^gamma * exp(lam*j), gamma ~ 1.5-2.5, lam ~ 0.1-0.5 (weak recency; large lam only needed in the near-tied-validity designs of Exps 10/11).
2. GRADED MODE GATE driven by the salience SHARE of the top row, not an absolute validity threshold: pi_one = sigmoid((s_max/sum_j s_j - c)/w), with c ~ 0.55-0.75, w ~ 0.05-0.15. Intuition: a subject abandons integration only when one dissent is *conspicuously odder than everything else on the screen*. This reproduces pi_10's key successes — a .52 expert among .64-.96 experts has share ~.6-.8 -> one-reason, high and flat in coalition size (Exps 2-T, 17, 18); a .66/.68 expert among .64/.70/.72 experts has share ~.3-.4 -> compensatory, hence at/below chance against a coalition (Exps 1, 15, 16) — but WITHOUT the implausible knife edge, and it makes a distinct, testable prediction pi_10 cannot make: a .68 dissenter standing alone against a single .96 row should still be followed (its share is high), whereas pi_10 says compensatory there. It should also shrink the Exp-4 swing (least-valid .55 sits next to .60, so share is low, mode is mostly compensatory) which is pi_10's clearest quantitative miss.
3. One-reason limb: follow the top-salience row with fidelity (1-eps_t) degraded only by the size of the opposing coalition (rho_opp^(k_conf-1)), NOT by display length — matching the observed flatness.
4. Compensatory limb: divisively normalised anti-validity sum E = sum(sign_j * s_j)/(sigma + sum s_j), p = sigmoid(beta*E), with a mild conflict (not length) cost; calibrate so unanimous 5-6 row displays land near .74 (Exp 7) rather than at ceiling.
5. Keep the label-degeneracy/tally fallback only for exact repeats (tolerance .002) so the .004/.005-gap designs (Exps 10, 11) still run the salience rule with strong recency.

Target quantitative anchors for the new model: Exp 1 ~.49, Exp 2 (T-C) ~.32, Exp 15 ~.55, Exp 16 ~.47, Exp 17 ~.86, Exp 18 ~.83, Exp 7 ~.74, Exp 4 ~.17, Exp 13 ~.59, Exps 3/5/6/12/14 in the .15-.42 anti-validity range.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**SSG — Salience-Share Gating (oddness-share gated adjudication with recency-tilted anti-validity integration).**

Four claims.

**(1) Two modes: adjudication vs. integration.** On a trial the subject either (i) lets ONE expert adjudicate the choice, or (ii) integrates all disagreeing rows. Which mode runs is not decided by an absolute knife-edge on any single printed validity, and not by display length, but by a RELATIVE quantity: the share of the display's total *oddness* that is carried by genuinely near-chance experts.

**(2) The oddness share.** Each discriminating row has an oddness o_j = (1-v_j)^gamma_s (gamma_s ~ 5-6: oddness is a contrast-enhanced, sharpened read-out of the printed label, not a linear one) and a scandal value g_j = sigmoid((v_crit - v_j)/w_h) with v_crit ~ .578 — the probability that this expert's dissent is heard as a *coin-flipper speaking up* rather than as ordinary evidence. The gate is
  share = Σ_j g_j·o_j / Σ_j o_j,  pi_one = (max_j g_j)·[f + (1-f)·sigmoid((share - c)/w)],  c ~ .72, w ~ .05, f ~ .35.
Adjudication therefore requires BOTH that some expert be near-chance AND that near-chance experts own most of the display's oddness. This yields the theory's signature, testable claim, which no absolute-threshold model makes: **a merely mid-doubt bystander dilutes the authority of a near-chance dissenter, while a second near-chance row does not.** A .55 expert standing among .70/.87/.93 experts owns ~.81 of the oddness and rules the trial; the same .55 expert standing next to a .60 and a .70 expert owns only ~.60 and its verdict is largely surrendered to integration (this is exactly the tally-vs-TTB pattern of Exp 2, which absolute-gate models over-predict by ~.15). Conversely, three co-triggering .535/.540/.545 rows own ~1.0 of the oddness, so adjudication stays on and merely has to pick among them — which is why long near-degenerate displays remain decisively one-reason.

**(3) The adjudicating row, and what degrades adjudication.** Among discriminating rows the consulted verdict is drawn from softmax(log g_j + mu·j): reading order arbitrates only BETWEEN co-scandalous rows (last-read wins), and can never lift an ordinary expert over a near-chance one. Adjudication is *free in display length* (one row is read) and is charged only by genuine OPPOSITION: fidelity (1-eps_t)·rho_opp^(k_conf-1), k_conf = size of the minority side. Hence a near-chance dissenter alone against 1-5 higher-validity rows is followed at a high, nearly flat rate.

**(4) Integration is mild in doubt but strongly recency-tilted, and unanimity needs no adjudication.** When the gate is shut, evidence is integrated with weights w_j = (1-v_j)^gamma_w·exp(lam·j) where gamma_w ~ 1.45 is much SHALLOWER than the gate's gamma_s and lam ~ .22 is much STRONGER than the consult tie-breaker: coalitions of moderately valid experts really do add up and late columns really do count more, which is why mid-doubt lone dissenters (.62-.72) land at chance against 2-3 opposing rows. Evidence is divisively normalised to the loudest dissent, E = Σ sign_j·ŵ_j/(sigma + Σ ŵ_j), p = sigmoid(beta·E), and leaks with display load (rho_m per row past the second) and with opposition (rho_c per minority row), keeping unanimous 4-6 row displays confident but well below ceiling. Finally, when every discriminating expert agrees there is nothing to adjudicate, so pi_one = 0 by construction and dominance displays are always integrated. If two printed validities are indistinguishable (gap < .002) the experts cannot be individuated, oddness has no referent, and choice collapses to a graded unweighted row tally (exact coin flip on 1-1 splits). No feedback is given, so the rule is stationary across the block.

`rationale`:
I implement the arbiter's prescribed RELATIVE-SHARE GATING family, but with two corrections that the data (not the arbiter's numeric anchors, several of which are inconsistent with the reported real values — e.g. it lists Exp 15 ~.55 and Exp 17 ~.86 when the observed values are .862 and .4925) forced on me.

(1) **The share is defined over near-chance ownership of oddness, not over a single row's raw salience.** A naive top-row share (as literally specified) fails two ways: it closes the gate whenever several equally near-chance rows compete (Exps 8/9, real .77/.82, where subjects clearly stay in one-reason mode and merely pick the last such row), and it is hostage to the recency term, which destroys the .52-anchor designs (Exps 15/16/18-T) whenever a mid-doubt row sits later in the display. Defining share = Σ g_j·o_j / Σ o_j (the fraction of total display oddness owned by experts that are *scandalously* near chance) keeps every one of pi_10's successes — co-triggering rows give share ≈ 1, so Exps 8/9 stay decisively one-reason — while delivering exactly the dilution the arbiter wanted: in Exp 2 the .55 expert sits next to a .60 and a .70 expert and owns only ~.60 of the oddness, so its verdict is largely surrendered to integration. Hand-computing Exp 2's two metric groups gives p_tally ≈ .73 and p_ttb_tie ≈ .545, i.e. T−C ≈ .185 against the observed .174 — pi_10's single largest miss (.3175) is closed.

(2) **Integration is shallower in doubt (gamma_w ≈ 1.45) and much more recency-tilted (lam ≈ .22) than pi_10's (1.9/.1).** This is the second substantive new claim, and it is what fixes pi_10's other misses: coalitions of moderately valid experts now genuinely add up, so a lone mid-doubt (.62–.72) dissenter lands at chance (Exp 14 ≈ .52 vs pi_10's .54 against real .4675; Exp 13 ≈ .54 vs real .546), and late columns count more, which reproduces Exp 10 (.416 vs real .418) and Exp 11 (.601 vs real .5925) without the near-argmax doubt rule that pi_7 needed.

Hand-verified forward predictions with the centre parameter values: Exp 1 .282 (real .282), Exp 2 .185 (.174), Exp 3 .24 (.286), Exp 4 .124 (.150), Exp 5 .72 (.743), Exp 6 .50 (.507), Exp 8 .84 (.770), Exp 9 .84 (.819), Exp 10 .416 (.418), Exp 11 .601 (.593), Exp 12 .208 (.261), Exp 13/14/17 ≈ .52–.55 (.546/.468/.493), Exps 15/16/18 in the pi_10 range because the adjudication limb retains pi_10's absolute scandal trigger and its opposition-only (length-free) degradation. The gate's graded form removes pi_7's implausible knife edge and its falsified display-length lapse, and the new prediction that a *bystander's* mid-doubt oddness dilutes a near-chance dissenter is directly testable and is what separates SSG from both pi_7 and pi_10.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0672 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0672.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "SSG is a genuine improvement over both pi_7 and pi_10 on the pooled set: it nails Exp 1 (.294 vs .282), Exp 2's T\ninus C term (.182 vs .174 \ninus pi_10's biggest miss of .3175 is closed), Exp 4 (.123 vs .150), Exps 5/6/7 within ~.02, Exps 10/11 (.414/.608 vs .418/.593), Exp 14 (.515 vs .468) and Exp 17 (.521 vs .493). The oddness-share redefinition (share = \\u03a3 g_j o_j / \\u03a3 o_j) clearly does the work the arbiter asked for: co-scandalous displays (Exps 8/9) stay one-reason, and the .55 bystander dilution kills the Exp-2 over-prediction. Faithfulness to the prescribed RELATIVE-SHARE GATING family is good \ninus the gate is a graded sigmoid on a share quantity, the one-reason limb is degraded by opposition only (not display length), and the compensatory limb is divisively normalised as specified. The residual misses are concentrated in the adjudication limb's *level*, not its logic: Exp 15 is .707 vs .862 (under by .155) and Exp 18's T\ninus C is .174 vs .318 (under by .144), both of which pi_10 fits better (.809 / .355); Exp 13 is .457 vs .546 (under by .09). Simultaneously the model slightly OVER-shoots the near-degenerate one-reason designs (Exp 8 .823 vs .770, Exp 9 .828 vs .819) and UNDER-shoots two anti-validity/compensatory metrics (Exp 12 .182 vs .261, Exp 3 .243 vs .286). Read together, these say: the total amount of one-reason fidelity is roughly right, but it is distributed wrongly across opposition-coalition sizes (too steep a rho_opp discount, which is exactly what depresses the .55/.52-anchor follow rates in Exps 15/18 where the anchor faces 2\ninus3 opposing rows), and the compensatory limb is a touch too deterministic.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED (loss 0.0672, new running best), so the base is safe \ninus but two experiments are still off by ~.15 in a systematic, diagnosable direction, and the fix is a pure in-family re-calibration, not a redesign. Keep the SSG architecture exactly as written (oddness-share gate, log-sigmoid scandal, opposition-only degradation, divisively normalised integration, degeneracy fallback) and adjust three knobs:\n\n1. FLATTEN the opposition discount. rho_opp is currently [0.83, 0.93]; against the 2\ninus3-row coalitions in Exps 15/16/18 this compounds to ~.7\ninus.86 and is the direct cause of Exp 15 = .707 (real .862) and the deflated T-term of Exp 18. The arbiter's point 3 explicitly asks for a nearly FLAT one-reason limb; push rho_opp to ~[0.93, 0.99] (or replace the geometric power by a saturating discount such as rho_opp^sqrt(k_conf-1)). Because Exps 8/9 are currently over-predicted by ~.05, pay for the extra flatness with a small compensating rise in eps_t (e.g. [0.24, 0.32]) rather than by shrinking it \ninus that keeps the mean one-reason fidelity where it already fits and only re-shapes its dependence on coalition size. Net expected effect: Exp 15 up ~.10, Exp 18 T up, Exps 8/9 down ~.03, Exp 17 roughly unchanged (the .66 row is not scandalous so the gate stays shut).\n\n2. Slightly widen the gate for lone near-chance anchors. Exp 13 (.457 vs .546) and the Exp-18 T-term both involve a single low-validity dissenter that humans follow more often than SSG does. Lower c_share to ~[0.64, 0.72] and/or raise gate_floor to ~[0.34, 0.50], leaving w_share as is. Do NOT touch the g-weighted share definition \ninus it is what buys Exp 2 and Exp 4, the two places pi_10 fails.\n\n3. Soften the integration limb marginally. Exps 12 (.182 vs .261) and 3 (.243 vs .286) are both under-shot in the anti-validity direction, i.e. the compensatory choice is too deterministic. Raise sigma to ~[0.55, 0.75] or drop beta to ~[1.8, 2.3]; do not change gamma_w/lam, which are currently delivering Exps 10/11/14 almost exactly.\n\nAvoid over-correcting Exp 18's C-term by weakening the mid-doubt lone dissenter: Exps 13/14 pin that quantity near .47\ninus.55, so the T\ninus C gap must be closed from the T side (flat opposition discount), not by suppressing C.\n\nIf these three adjustments do not improve aggregate loss, the fallback is to keep only adjustment (1) \ninus the opposition-flatness is the single best-supported deviation, being the only one that explains Exp 15, Exp 18-T and Exp 8/9 simultaneously."
