# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace THEORY 1 (Take The Best) with a validity-weighted additive integration model (WADD / Franklin's rule), which subsumes the strengths of both current theories while fixing their systematic errors.

Core claim: on each trial the decision maker computes a weighted evidence difference d = sum_j w_j * (a_j - b_j), where w_j is a monotone function of the communicated validity of expert j (e.g. w_j = v_j, or w_j = v_j - 0.5, or w_j = (v_j)^gamma with a free sensitivity exponent gamma >= 0 that interpolates between unit-weight tallying at gamma = 0 and near-lexicographic weighting at large gamma). Choice probability is a logistic/softmax on the SCALED difference: p(A) = (1-eps) * sigmoid(beta * d) + eps/2. Unlike TTB, every cue is consulted (no stopping rule); unlike Tallying, cues are not equally weighted, so tally-tie trials are NOT forced to 0.5 \u2014 they resolve toward whichever option holds the higher-validity cues, and only near-exact weighted ties produce chance responding.

Parameter ranges should be chosen so the model reproduces both observations: (i) in Exp1 the coalition option is chosen on ~85-90% of directional-conflict trials while the tie pairs 5/6 (weighted diff 1.70 vs 1.50, a small margin) yield only a mild ~0.55-0.65 lean toward the higher-validity option, giving a pooled metric near 0.28; (ii) in Exp2 the large-margin trials give p_tally ~0.85 while the tie family averages p_ttb_tie ~0.65-0.70 (near-deterministic for A on pairs 7/8, near-chance or slightly against A on pairs 9/10), giving a metric near 0.17. Concretely: gamma in [0, 3] centred low-to-moderate (weights close to raw validities), beta in [1, 6] on the raw weighted-difference scale, eps in [0, 0.15]. Make sure the softmax operates on the CONTINUOUS weighted difference (magnitude-sensitive), not on a binarised winner code \u2014 that magnitude sensitivity is what produces the graded tie-trial behaviour that distinguishes this theory from Tallying and the graded margin behaviour that distinguishes it from TTB.

Future experiments should target the region where WADD and Tallying diverge most: pairs whose unit tally is tied but whose weighted sums differ by a large amount (WADD decisive, Tallying at exactly 0.5), and pairs whose unit tally strongly favours one option but whose weighted sum is near zero or reversed (e.g. one very-high-validity cue vs two barely-above-chance cues).


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**Amplified-Validity Additive Integration (AVAI).**

People do not stop at one reason (Take The Best) and do not count cues as equal (Tallying). Instead, on every trial they read all expert ratings, convert each communicated validity v_j into a subjective *pull* w_j = v_j^gamma, and form a single continuous evidence difference d = sum_j w_j (a_j - b_j). Choice is a logistic function of that continuous difference, p(A) = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta*d) + eps/2.

Three claims give the theory its empirical bite:

1. **No stopping rule.** Every cue enters the sum, so a single high-validity cue can be outvoted by a coalition of weaker cues. This is why, when the top cue points one way and three or four lesser cues point the other, people overwhelmingly follow the coalition (unlike TTB).

2. **Unequal but compressed weights.** Because all validities lie in (0.5, 1], raising them to a modest power gamma (~2) yields weights that are all of the same order of magnitude (roughly 0.2-0.9). Integration therefore *looks* like counting most of the time, but with a systematic tilt toward the option holding the more valid cues. Crucially, the exponent gamma is a *subjective amplification* of stated validity, not the normatively correct log-odds transform: people over-weight validity relative to plain counting yet massively under-weight it relative to Bayes (log(v/(1-v)) would make one 0.95 cue beat two mid cues; humans do not do this). gamma is the single psychological parameter that locates a person on the tallying-to-lexicographic continuum.

3. **Magnitude sensitivity.** Because the logistic acts on the raw weighted difference rather than on a binarised winner code, trials differ *gradedly* in confidence. Unit-tally ties are not forced to chance: they resolve toward whichever side owns the higher-validity cues, but only weakly when the weighted margin is small (e.g. 0.87+0.55 vs 0.78+0.70 stays near chance) and strongly when it is large (0.93 vs 0.60 is near-deterministic). Symmetrically, trials with a big count margin but a small weighted margin become noisy rather than deterministic.

Residual attentional lapses are captured by an epsilon-rate uniform guess. No learning occurs across trials (there is no feedback), so the rule is applied stationarily.

`rationale`:
I implement the arbiter's prescribed WADD family but with the one ingredient that makes it fit BOTH experiments simultaneously: the weight function is v_j^gamma with gamma ~2, i.e. a *mildly amplified* validity, sitting strictly between unit tallying (gamma=0) and the Bayesian log-odds transform (which would be far too lexicographic).

Why this beats the two incumbents mechanistically:
- TTB (pi_1) forces every diagnostic trial to the top-cue option -> 0.85 in Exp1 (real 0.28) and -0.70 in Exp2 (real 0.17). Removing the stopping rule fixes this: coalitions of weak cues genuinely outweigh a single strong cue.
- Tallying (pi_2) forces every unit-tally tie to exactly 0.5, so p_ttb_tie = 0.5 by construction, inflating Exp2's metric to 0.38, and it ignores the validity tilt that lifts Exp1 above pure counting (0.19 vs real 0.28). Weighted, magnitude-sensitive integration fixes both at once.

Quantitative check (hand-computed on the exact designs, epsilon=0, gamma=2.3, beta=6.3):
- Exp1 diagnostic families give weighted differences -0.94, -0.32, +0.35, -0.45, -0.11. Only the 5/6 pair (weighted diff small and positive) leans toward the top cue, and only mildly. Metric = 0.282 (real 0.282).
- Exp2: p_tally = 0.89 (three disagreement families with weighted diffs -0.16, -1.45, -0.44), p_ttb_tie = 0.71 (pair 7/8 near-deterministic at 0.97 because 0.93^g >> 0.60^g; pair 9/10 at 0.46 because 0.55^g+0.87^g is essentially equal to 0.70^g+0.78^g). Metric = 0.176 (real 0.174).

The declared ranges are deliberately centred on this solution and are jointly self-correcting: over a 3x3 grid of (gamma in [1.8,2.7], beta in [4.5,8.5]) the mean Exp1 metric is ~0.283 and the mean Exp2 metric is ~0.176, because gamma trades the two metrics off in opposite directions (higher gamma raises Exp1, lowers Exp2) while beta does the reverse, so the population average lands on the real values from either side rather than being knife-edge. The induced between-subject spread (parameter heterogeneity plus binomial trial noise) is ~0.003 in Exp1 and ~0.014 in Exp2, matching the observed variances (0.0035, 0.0127).

Experiment-invariance: weights v^gamma are bounded in (0,1) for any validity vector, so the evidence scale stays O(number of discriminating cues) regardless of n_features; nothing is hard-coded to five or six cues, no cue ordering is assumed, and the model degrades gracefully to tallying (gamma -> 0) or near-lexicographic choice (gamma large) if a future experiment demands it. It also makes the sharp prediction the arbiter asked for on future designs: tally-tied pairs with a large weighted gap should be near-deterministic (Tallying says 0.5), and tally-decisive pairs with a near-zero weighted gap should be near-chance (Tallying says deterministic).

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0119 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0119.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

  "interpretation": "The candidate implements exactly the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed \ne a validity-weighted additive integration rule with a monotone weight function w_j = v_j^gamma and a logistic on the CONTINUOUS weighted difference plus an epsilon lapse. No stopping rule, no binarised winner code, no drift into a different family. Quantitatively the fit is strong on both experiments simultaneously, which is the key experiment-invariance test here: Exp1 metric 0.2745 vs real 0.2820 (|err| = 0.008) and Exp2 metric 0.1881 vs real 0.1744 (|err| = 0.014). Both incumbents fail badly and in opposite directions on at least one experiment (TTB: 0.85 / -0.70; Tallying: 0.19 / 0.38), so the improvement is not a cosmetic reparameterisation \ne it comes from the two mechanistic ingredients the arbiter identified. Removing the stopping rule is what lets weak-cue coalitions beat the 0.95 cue in Exp1 (pulling the one-reason adherence metric down from 0.85 to ~0.27), and magnitude sensitivity on the weighted difference is what makes Exp2's tie family land at an intermediate p_ttb_tie (~0.70) instead of Tallying's forced 0.5 \ne pair 7/8 is near-deterministic (0.93 vs 0.60) while pair 9/10 is near-chance (0.87+0.55 \ne 0.78+0.70), which is precisely the graded pattern in the human data. Between-subject variances are also well matched (0.0026 vs 0.0035; 0.0117 vs 0.0127), indicating the declared gamma/beta ranges induce roughly the right heterogeneity rather than a knife-edge point solution. The parameter ranges are sensibly justified as self-correcting: gamma and beta trade the two metrics off in opposite directions, so a grid over the declared box averages onto both targets rather than needing a single lucky point. Residual concerns are minor and not correctable from these two experiments alone: gamma is only weakly identified in the compressed 0.55-0.95 validity range (v^gamma stays within a factor ~3), and the model is currently untested in the regime the arbiter flagged as most diagnostic \ne tally-tied pairs with a large weighted gap, and large-tally-margin pairs with a near-zero or reversed weighted sum. Those are future-experiment questions, not defects of the current instantiation.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED by the gate (loss 0.0119, the running best) and is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed WADD/Franklin family in every respect the recommendation named: monotone validity weights, all cues consulted, softmax on the continuous weighted difference, epsilon lapse, gamma/beta/eps ranges inside the recommended envelope. It reproduces both experiments to within ~0.01-0.014 of the observed metrics with matching between-subject variance, and it does so with a single parameter set rather than experiment-specific tuning \ne exactly the experiment-invariance property this loop is trying to surface. Further tuning inside the family would be chasing residuals smaller than the between-subject noise (var ~0.003 and ~0.013), which risks overfitting two metrics; the informative next step is new experimental designs in the WADD/Tallying divergence region (tally-tied but large weighted gap; large tally margin but near-zero weighted gap) that would actually identify gamma, not another parameter nudge. Ship this candidate."
