## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended decision-making theories make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every theory agrees, and prefer pairs that maximally dissociate the candidate theories. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] Five experts with clearly spread, strictly ordered validities (0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55) so the TTB cue cascade is unambiguous and matches feature index order. The 12 unique pairs (repeated 8x each = 96 trials) are built to dissociate one-reason decision making from unit-weight tallying along three quantitative dimensions:

(1) CONFLICT MAGNITUDE. Pairs 1-4 pit the single highest-validity cue against a coalition of lower cues, varying the tally margin from 4 (A=[1,0,0,0,0] vs B=[0,1,1,1,1]) to 1 (A=[1,0,0,0,0] vs B=[0,1,1,0,0]). TTB predicts identical choice probabilities across these pairs (always the option winning cue 1, with p fixed by beta and epsilon), whereas Tallying predicts an ordered gradient: near-deterministic choice of the coalition option at margin 4 and a shallower, beta-scaled preference at margin 1. This is a quantitative signature, not merely a directional one: TTB is flat over margins, Tallying is monotone increasing.

(2) TALLY-TIE TRIALS. Pairs 5-6 (A=[1,0,1,0,0] vs B=[0,1,0,1,0] and its mirror) give each option exactly two feature wins, so Tallying must guess at exactly 50/50 regardless of its parameters, while TTB is fully decisive in favour of the option winning cue 1. Any systematic deviation from chance here cannot be produced by Tallying at all, making these trials a parameter-free falsification test.

(3) CASCADE POSITION. Pairs 9-11 place the first discriminating cue lower in the cascade (cue 2 after a tie on cue 1; cue 3 after ties on cues 1-2) while the remaining lower cues favour the other option. TTB still predicts the same high, constant probability for the option winning the first discriminating cue; Tallying predicts the opposite choice. If subjects' accuracy on the discriminating-cue option degrades as that cue moves down the cascade, that also constrains the subjective-validity assumption inside TTB.

Pairs 7-8 are agreement controls where both heuristics select the same option, giving a baseline for lapse rate (epsilon) and beta that is uncontaminated by the model contrast. Every pair and its mirror image appear so that the correct response is balanced across the A and B keys for both models, ruling out side bias as an explanation. No pair is degenerate: on every trial at least one model is decisive, and on 10 of 12 the models disagree either in direction or in predicted confidence.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — theories that depend on validity order re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) make many candidate theories indistinguishable, so spread them out.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended theories be dissociated; avoid trials where every theory agrees.


## Response

```json
{
  "rationale": "GOAL: dissociate one-reason decision making (TTB) from unit-weight vote counting (Tallying) using (i) a validity order that is deliberately NOT the display order, (ii) a tally-margin gradient over which TTB is flat, (iii) parameter-free tally-tie trials, and (iv) cascade-depth manipulations.\n\nVALIDITIES: six experts shown in display order with validities [0.60, 0.93, 0.55, 0.87, 0.70, 0.78]. The descending cue cascade is therefore feature index 1 (.93) > 3 (.87) > 5 (.78) > 4 (.70) > 0 (.60) > 2 (.55). Because the top cue is Expert 2 rather than Expert 1, any subject who follows a genuine validity cascade must reorder the display, whereas Tallying is completely invariant to the permutation. This also guards against a confound present when validities descend with index: 'use the leftmost cue' can no longer masquerade as TTB.\n\n16 unique pairs, each repeated 6x (96 trials), every pair present together with its A/B mirror so the model-predicted response is exactly balanced across keys (no side-bias explanation).\n\n(1) TALLY-MARGIN GRADIENT (pairs 1-6). One option wins only the top cue (index 1); the other wins a coalition of lower-validity cues, with the tally margin escalating 1 -> 2 -> 4: [0,1,0,0,0,0] vs [1,0,1,0,0,0], vs [1,0,1,0,1,0], vs [1,0,1,1,1,1]. TTB is decisive for the top-cue option with the SAME probability sigmoid(beta)-scaled value on all three, i.e. flat across margins. Tallying reverses direction (choosing the coalition option) and its confidence increases monotonically with margin, from a shallow beta-scaled preference at margin 1 to near-determinism at margin 4. Flat-vs-monotone over margin is a quantitative, not merely directional, signature.\n\n(2) PARAMETER-FREE TALLY TIES (pairs 7-10). Pair 7: [0,1,0,0,0,0] vs [1,0,0,0,0,0] \u2014 each option wins exactly one cue, so Tallying MUST be exactly 50/50 for any beta and epsilon, while TTB is decisive for A (cue 1, .93, beats cue 0, .60). Note the naive 'read left to right' strategy predicts the opposite option here, so this pair simultaneously falsifies Tallying and index-order pseudo-TTB. Pair 9: [0,0,1,1,0,0] vs [0,0,0,0,1,1] \u2014 a 2-2 tally tie in which TTB's winner is set by a mid-cascade comparison (cue 3, .87, vs cues 5/4), again forcing Tallying to chance while TTB is decisive for A.\n\n(3) CASCADE DEPTH WITH CONSTANT TALLY (pairs 11-14). Pair 11 ([0,0,0,0,0,1] vs [1,0,1,0,1,0]) has the identical tally structure to pair 3 (1 vs 3) but the first discriminating cue sits third in the cascade (index 5) after two ties; pair 13 ([0,0,0,0,1,0] vs [1,0,1,0,0,0]) matches pair 1's margin of 1 but the discriminator is fourth in the cascade (index 4). Tallying predicts exactly the same probabilities as its margin-matched counterparts, while TTB predicts the same high probability for the discriminating-cue option regardless of depth. Any systematic decay in choosing the discriminating-cue option as it moves down the cascade would violate both models as specified and constrain subjective validities inside TTB.\n\n(4) AGREEMENT BASELINE (pairs 15-16). [1,1,1,0,1,0] vs [0,0,0,1,0,1]: the top cue and the tally (4-2) point the same way, so both models predict the same option. These trials identify epsilon and beta free of the model contrast, so the contrast trials can be read as genuine model divergence rather than overall noise.\n\nNo pair is degenerate: on 14 of 16 pairs the models disagree in direction, and on the remaining agreement pairs they differ in nothing but supply the noise baseline.",
