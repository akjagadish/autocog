# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_9`).

Replace pi_9 with a DOUBT-THRESHOLD-GATED MIXTURE theory (working name: DTG-2R, 'Doubt-Triggered One-Reason with compensatory fallback'). Core claims:

(1) ABSOLUTE doubt trigger, not relative argmax. An expert commands one-reason adjudication only if its PRINTED validity falls below an absolute threshold theta (fit range ~.56-.64), i.e. only experts that are essentially coin-flips are 'newsworthy'. Trigger strength should be a steep but smooth function of (theta - v), e.g. g = sigmoid((theta - v)/tau) with tau ~ .01-.04.

(2) When a sub-threshold expert discriminates, choice follows its verdict with very high probability, independent of how many higher-validity rows oppose it: target ~.85-.90 after lapses on 1-vs-1 through 1-vs-5 and on 2-vs-2 / 3-vs-3 ties (this is what Exps 1 and 2 demand: .862 and .826, flat across coalition size). The load lapse must be MILD in these cells — noticeably milder than pi_7's current eps0/rho, which drag these to .72-.76.

(3) When NO sub-threshold expert discriminates, the trigger is off and evidence is compensatory: a divisively-normalized, anti-validity ((1-v)^gamma) and recency-tilted (exp(lam*j)) weighted sum over discriminating rows, so that a lone mid-doubt dissenter (v~.62-.68) opposed by a coalition of 2-3 sits at .45-.56 (Exps 15, 16) and conflict-display metrics land near .42-.60 (Exps 12, 13).

(4) Silent sub-threshold experts do NOT need a special 'capture' mechanism: the near-chance behaviour in silent-anchor displays follows automatically from (3). Drop null-verdict capture and the doubt-gradient leak, or keep at most a small residual — they are now redundant and were the source of pi_7's over-prediction in Exps 15/16.

(5) Preserve the two features already validated across the corpus: the label-degeneracy collapse to an unweighted tally when two printed validities are within .002 (Exps 10, 11 fit at ~.77-.82 via recency among near-equal labels), and a load-dependent lapse that keeps unanimous 6-0 dominance at ~.74 (Exp 7) rather than ceiling.

The new theory differs from pi_7 by making the one-reason rule conditional on an ABSOLUTE near-chance validity rather than on being the relative minimum among discriminating rows, and by being compensatory when no near-chance expert speaks; it differs from pi_9 by denying that coalitions can ever overturn a genuinely near-chance dissenter. Parameter ranges should be chosen so that, at mid-box, the model reproduces: Exp1 ~.86, Exp2 ~.83, Exp15 ~.54, Exp16 ~.47, Exp7 ~.74, Exp13 ~.59, Exp12 ~.42, Exp14 ~.26, Exp6 ~.15.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
DTG-2R — Doubt-Threshold-Gated one-reason choice with a compensatory fallback. (1) One-reason adjudication is commanded only by an expert whose PRINTED validity is essentially a coin flip: trigger strength g_j = sigmoid((theta - v_j)/tau) with theta ~ .575-.605 and tau ~ .008-.020, evaluated only over rows that actually discriminate (P_trig = max_{j in disc} g_j). Silent near-chance experts are irrelevant, so no null-verdict capture and no doubt-gradient leak are required. (2) When a sub-threshold expert speaks, its verdict decides the trial essentially independently of how many higher-validity rows oppose it; among discriminating rows the consulted verdict is drawn from softmax(log g_j + mu*j), so the recency tilt mu only arbitrates BETWEEN near-chance rows (e.g. three ~.54 columns). Because only one row is consulted, the load lapse in this branch is mild (eps_t, slow decay rho_t), giving ~.85 following at 1-vs-1 and still ~.78 at 1-vs-5 — flat across coalition size. (3) When no near-chance expert discriminates, evidence is compensatory: anti-validity, weakly recency-tilted weights w_j = (1-v_j)^gamma * exp(lam*j), divisively normalised to the loudest dissent, E = sum(s_j*what_j)/(sigma + sum(what_j)), p = sigmoid(beta*E). Opposing voices cancel in the numerator but both inflate the denominator, so conflict displays sit near chance (a lone mid-doubt dissenter against 2-3 more valid rows lands at ~.48-.57) while unanimous displays stay confident. (4) Losing the thread is charged only in the compensatory branch, and from two separable sources: display load (rho_m per extra row) and opposition (rho_c per minority row), so unanimous 6-row displays stay ~.74 while balanced conflicts of the same size collapse toward chance. (5) If any two printed validities are within .002 the experts cannot be individuated: the doubt gate has no referent and choice collapses to a graded unweighted row tally (exact coin flip on 1-1 splits). No feedback is given, so the rule is stationary across the block.

Summed absolute error ~.61 vs pi_7's .753, and L2 over per-experiment errors ~.19 vs pi_7's .27 — the gain comes almost entirely from the four cells pi_7 mis-mechanised. Three design choices do the work. (i) Making the one-reason rule conditional on an ABSOLUTE near-chance validity separates the .52-.55 anchors (which must be followed ~.83 flat against coalitions of 1-5) from the .62-.68 'least valid discriminating' rows (which must sit near chance): a steep sigmoid gate gives g(.55)=.94 but g(.62)=.09 and g(.68)=.004, something no relative-argmax rule can do. (ii) Because the one-reason branch consults a single row, its lapse is load-insensitive (rho_t=.95), which is exactly what keeps the anchor-coalition cells flat and high where pi_7 decayed them to .72-.76; the compensatory branch instead pays both a load and an opposition price, which keeps unanimous 6-0 displays at ~.74 while sending balanced conflicts to chance. (iii) Divisive normalisation with a sizeable sigma and a moderate beta makes the fallback nearly uninformative on conflicts, which reproduces the whole family of near-chance human values (.42-.59) in the silent-anchor, late-cue and doubt-weighted-sum designs without any ad-hoc capture term; recency is retained only INSIDE the trigger competition (mu), which is what resolves the .955/.950/.945 and .958/.954/.950 near-degenerate designs toward the last coin-flip column while leaving the last-read-cue metric at chance elsewhere. Overall decisiveness is deliberately held at ~.82 rather than ~.95, the level that simultaneously satisfies the strongly anti-validity metrics (.15-.29) and the anchor-following metrics (.83-.86).

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0707 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0707.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate (DTG-2R) is faithful to the arbiter's prescription: an absolute near-chance validity gate (sigmoid((theta-v)/tau), theta~.59, tau~.014) commanding a load-insensitive one-reason branch, a divisively-normalised anti-validity compensatory fallback when no sub-threshold expert speaks, the label-degeneracy tally collapse, and separate load/conflict lapses. No mechanism drift, and the accept gate confirms it is the best-fitting instantiation so far (loss .0707).\n\nPer-experiment fit is good on 11 of 16 cells (|err| <= .05): Exp1 .253/.282, Exp4 .138/.150, Exp6 .518/.507, Exp7 .452/.438, Exp9 .799/.819, Exp10 .419/.418 (best of all theories), Exp11 .614/.593, Exp12 .211/.261, Exp13 .506/.546, Exp16 .804/.826, Exp8 .810/.770. The degeneracy gate is clearly doing real work (Exp6 at chance, Exp8/9 at ~.80 where every non-DTG theory is either at ceiling or floor), and the compensatory branch is what finally rescues Exp10 and Exp12, which pi_1..pi_6 miss by .3-.5.\n\nThe residual errors are systematic and point in one consistent direction rather than being random noise:\n(a) The COMPENSATORY branch is a touch too decisive / too anti-validity. Exp2 overshoots badly (+.116: .290 vs .174 \u2014 the tally-minus-TTB gap is inflated), Exp3 undershoots (-.069, too anti-validity on tally-tie trials), Exp12 undershoots (-.050, same direction), Exp1 slightly under (-.029), and dominance displays are too confident (Exp5 .801 vs .743; Exp8 .810 vs .770). All six are consistent with beta too high / sigma too small / eps0 too small in the fallback.\n(b) The recency+anti-validity tilt inside the fallback over-favours a lone EARLY least-valid dissenter. Exp14 (+.105: .573 vs .468) and Exp13 (-.040: .506 vs .546) both isolate a column-0 lone dissenter against a 2-3 coalition, with human values essentially at chance in both (.47, .55). The model separates them too much: it follows the v=.62 col-0 dissenter at .57 but the v=.68 col-0 dissenter at .51, i.e. the (1-v)^gamma gradient is steeper than humans show in this range.\n(c) The TRIGGER branch is slightly too lapse-y: Exp15 .777 vs .862 (-.085) and Exp16 .804 vs .826 (-.022). The arbiter's target for these cells was ~.85-.86 flat; eps_t in [.20,.36] is eating ~5-8 points of anchor-following.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep DTG-2R exactly as specified by the arbiter \u2014 absolute doubt gate + one-reason branch + divisively-normalised anti-validity fallback + degeneracy tally + split load/conflict lapse. Do NOT change the mechanism family; only re-tune three knobs, each of which pushes several cells in the same helpful direction. (1) Soften the compensatory branch: raise sigma to roughly [.60,.95] and/or lower beta to roughly [1.4,2.1], with eps0 nudged up to ~[.17,.30]. This pulls Exp2 down from .29 toward .17-.22, lifts Exp3 (.22->.26) and Exp12 (.21->.25), lifts Exp1 slightly toward .28, and brings the dominance cells Exp5 (.80->.76) and Exp8 (.81->.78) down to their human values. Watch Exp4 (.138) and Exp10 (.419) \u2014 both should stay put or improve slightly, so this is a low-risk global move. (2) Flatten the anti-validity gradient in the fallback only: lower gamma to ~[1.1,1.7] and/or trim lam to ~[.00,.12]. Exp13 and Exp14 both isolate a column-0 lone dissenter and both should land near .48-.55; the current gamma=1.9 makes the v=.62 dissenter far too compelling (Exp14 .573 vs .468) while barely helping the v=.68 case (Exp13 .506 vs .546). A shallower exponent compresses the pair toward the .47-.55 band the data demand. Make sure this does NOT change the trigger branch \u2014 Exps 15/16 must not be touched by gamma. (3) Make the one-reason branch slightly stiffer: drop eps_t to ~[.12,.24] and keep rho_t high (>=.95). Target Exp15 ~.84-.86 and Exp16 ~.82-.84, exactly the flat-across-coalition-size following the arbiter asked for; this is the single largest remaining residual (-.085 on Exp15). Expect a small cost on Exp1 (first-cue adherence may fall .01-.02 below .282) \u2014 that cost is smaller than the Exp15/16 gain, but if it bites, compensate by nudging theta down to the bottom of its range (~.572) so the v=.60 column in Exp2 and the v=.62 column in Exp14 leak less trigger mass into the one-reason branch. Do not widen theta above .605 or shrink tau below .008: the current gate cleanly separates .52-.55 anchors from .62-.68 dissenters and that separation is the theory's main empirical win."
