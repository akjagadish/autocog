# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with a NON-COMPENSATORY 'maximum-doubt' account that is a sharp rival to pi_6's compensatory summation, and that is calibrated to the whole corpus.

Sketch — MDSC (Maximum-Doubt Single-Cue selection):
(1) On each trial the subject scans only the rows on which A and B differ and settles the trial with the SINGLE discriminating expert whose stated validity is LOWEST, i.e. the most doubtful/most 'newsworthy' disagreement. No summation: coalitions of agreeing rows buy nothing, so being outvoted 1-vs-4 is irrelevant (this is what Experiments 1/10 show: .82/.77 in favour of the lone late low-validity row).
(2) Row position enters only as a WEAK tie-breaker/recency gain, log u_j = delta*log(1-v_j) + lam*j with lam small (0.2-0.7, definitely NOT the 1.5 both current models assume) and delta near 1. This is the critical quantitative commitment: it makes col-5 win among the three near-tied .546/.542/.538 lows in Experiment 1 (hence ~.82) while making the low-validity EARLY columns beat the late .93/.99 columns in Experiment 2 (hence ~.42, below chance). Selection of the winning row should be a soft-max over u with a moderate temperature so the rule is decisive (near-argmax) rather than probability-matching — proportional/share-based selection produces ~.52 on Experiment 2 and is ruled out.
(3) LABEL-DEGENERACY GATE, all-or-none and only on EXACT repetition of a printed label (tolerance ~.002, not a graded numeric-gap function): when any validity value is printed twice ([.95,.70,.55,.95,.70,.55]) the experts cannot be individuated, the doubt rule is unavailable, and choice reduces to an unweighted row tally (coin flip on 1-1 splits) — this is required by Experiment 8's .507 and must NOT fire for the .004-gap designs of Experiments 1/10.
(4) LOAD-DEPENDENT LAPSE: p(guess) = 1 - (1-eps0)*rho^(m-2) with a fairly large eps0 (~.3) and rho ~.8, so unanimous 6-row displays land near .74 (Experiment 7) and conflict displays are compressed toward chance in the right amount to turn a 6/6 base-level hit rate into the observed .82 and a 3/9 base-level rate into the observed .42.

How it differs from both: unlike pi_5 it drops the graded numeric-gap gate (falsified) and drops proportional/one-row-sampling near-chance behaviour; unlike pi_6 it denies compensatory summation — the decisive contrast becomes coalition displays where several sub-maximal doubtful rows oppose one more doubtful row (pi_6: the coalition can win; MDSC: never). Parameter ranges must be set so that lam stays well below the doubt term's dynamic range, and predictions should be sanity-checked against all ten observed values (Exp1 ~.82, Exp2 ~.42, Exp3 ~.28, Exp4 ~.17, Exp5 ~.29, Exp6 ~.15, Exp7 ~.74, Exp8 ~.51, Exp9 ~.44, Exp10 ~.77) before submission.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**MDSC-NV (sharpened) — Maximum-Doubt Single-Cue selection with Null-Verdict capture.**

Four claims; the mechanism family is unchanged from the accepted base, but one quantitative commitment is sharpened.

**(1) One-reason choice by MAXIMUM DOUBT (no summation).** On each trial the subject settles A-vs-B with the verdict of a SINGLE expert. Which expert is consulted is decided by *doubt*: a disagreement voiced by a near-chance expert (v≈.53) is a strange, newsworthy fact that has to be adjudicated, whereas a disagreement voiced by a near-certain expert (v≈.97) is discounted as a mere echo of the impression the subject already has. Salience is log u_j = delta*log(1-v_j) + lam*j and the consulted row is drawn from softmax(u). **The doubt gain is LARGER than previously assumed (delta ≈ 13-17, not 8-12): the doubt rule is essentially argmax, not a graded share.** This is the sharpened commitment. It matters wherever two moderately-doubtful rows are within ~0.4 log-validity of one another (e.g. v=.55 vs v=.70 rows two columns apart): a share-based rule lets the second-most-doubtful row steal ~18% of the verdict and blunts the choice, whereas the near-argmax rule leaves the display fully decided by the single most doubtful row. Coalitions still buy nothing: five agreeing rows never outvote one more-doubtful row, which is why choice is systematically anti-validity in every design where the printed labels are usable.

**(2) Reading position is a WEAK tie-breaker.** lam = pos_ratio*delta with pos_ratio ≈ 0.09-0.14 — an order of magnitude below the doubt term's dynamic range. Position therefore only arbitrates between rows whose stated validities are (nearly) *equal* — exactly the .955/.950/.945 and .958/.954/.950 designs, where it makes the last low-validity row win. Whenever validities genuinely differ, doubt beats recency: a low-validity EARLY column defeats a late .93/.99 column. Because delta is raised and pos_ratio held fixed, the *ratio* of doubt-range to positional gain is preserved, so all orderings in the corpus are unchanged.

**(3) NULL-VERDICT CAPTURE.** Doubt is a property of the *expert*, not of the disagreement, so attention is captured pre-attentively by the most doubtful expert **in the whole display**, before the subject checks whether that expert actually discriminates. With probability q (≈ .41, slightly higher than previously estimated) the subject simply goes with whoever captured attention; if that expert gave both products the same rating it returns no verdict, the subject has nothing to adjudicate and guesses. With probability 1-q the subject re-targets deliberately, restricting the doubt competition to the rows that differ. Sharp prediction: *holding the discriminating rows fixed, adding agreement on a MORE doubtful (lower-validity) row pushes choice toward chance*, whereas adding agreement on a high-validity row does nothing. Displays in which only two high/mid-validity rows disagree while the display's most doubtful expert stays silent are therefore near chance — no compensatory or one-reason model predicts that non-discriminating rows matter at all.

**(4) LABEL-DEGENERACY GATE (all-or-none) and LOAD LAPSE.** The doubt rule presupposes that each printed validity picks out one expert. If any label is printed twice (tolerance .002 — it must NOT fire for the .004/.005-gap designs) the experts are interchangeable, the doubt ordering is unavailable, and choice collapses to a graded unweighted row tally (exact coin flip on 1-1 splits). Independently, the more rows disagree the more often the subject loses the thread: p(guess) = 1-(1-eps0)*rho^(m-2), which compresses conflict displays toward chance and keeps even unanimous 6-row displays well below ceiling. Individual subjects differ mainly in how leaky (eps0, rho) and how capture-prone (q) they are, not in the doubt rule itself.

No feedback is given, so the rule is stationary across the block.

`rationale`:
MINIMAL DIFF: `predict`/`policy` are byte-identical to the accepted base; only sampling ranges changed. Two knobs move (doubt_gain 8-12 -> 13-17, capture .30-.40 -> .33-.49) and three are widened around their old centres (eps0, rho, tally_kappa) for between-subject dispersion. Every change was chosen after hand-simulating the residual experiments.

Why doubt_gain up (the critic's Exp4 suggestion, but the real payoff is Exp2). The single largest residual is Exp2 (contrast .251 vs .174 = 51% of the squared loss). I traced it trial-by-trial. The contrast is p_tally(lopsided conflict trials) - p_ttb(tally-tie trials). The tie trial A=[0,0,1,1,0,0]/B=[0,0,0,0,1,1] has disc rows {2(A,v=.55), 3(A,v=.87), 4(B,v=.70), 5(B,v=.78)}. At delta=10 the doubt leader col2 only holds t=.82 of the softmax because col4 (v=.70, two columns later) is just 1.65 log-units behind, so p_core_a=.816 and the model returns .658 where the data need ~.72. At delta=15 the same gap becomes 2.48 (col2 holds .92), p rises to .709, and p_ttb_tie rises by .026, dropping the contrast with essentially no side effects: the doubt ORDERING is unchanged in all ten designs (I re-checked Exp1 col4>col3 gap 3.77+lam, Exp8/9 col5>col3>col1 gaps ~2.5-3.7, Exp10 col0 still leader), because lam = pos_ratio*delta scales with delta so the doubt/position ratio is preserved. The same edit makes the v=.53 column strictly decisive in Exp4's two tally-tie designs, moving Exp4 from .188 toward .15 exactly as the critic asked.

Why capture up only to ~.41. The other half of Exp2's residual is the 1-vs-1 tie A=[0,1,0,0,0,0]/B=[1,0,0,0,0,0], where the display's doubt leader (col2, v=.55) is SILENT: only null-verdict capture can move it off .25 toward the ~.34-.43 the data require. dContrast/dq = -.19, so q=.41 buys ~.026. I explicitly rejected the critic-adjacent temptation to push q to .7-.85: hand-simulation shows q=.85 lifts Exp1 to .33 (real .282), Exp3 to .32 (real .286) and Exp4 to .22 (real .150) - a net LOSS of ~.007 in squared error versus a .006 gain on Exp2. I also tested and rejected an (n-m)-scaled capture (q_eff = 1-(1-q)^(silent rows)): it fixes Exp2 outright but destroys Exp5 (.66), Exp8 (.72) and Exp9 (.75). q=.41 is the local optimum where the Exp2 gain (~.004 squared) still exceeds the pooled Exp5/8/9 cost (~.0015).

What I deliberately did NOT do. (a) The critic suggested raising pos_ratio for Exp8/9. Hand-simulation shows this is counter-productive: at pos_ratio=.20 the Exp2 tie trial's doubt mass splits between col2 and col4, p_ttb collapses to .47 and the Exp2 contrast RISES to .25; meanwhile Exp8/9 are already ordering-decisive (col5 leads by 2.5-3.7 log units), so their residual is pure lapse ceiling, not ordering. (b) The critic suggested shaving eps0 for Exp9. Global lapse reduction raises Exp9 (+) but simultaneously pushes Exp5 (dominance, real .743) to ~.79, Exp8 above .77, and Exp1/Exp3/Exp10 further below chance - a net loss. Exp9's ~.05 shortfall is a genuine structural ceiling of this family, and the corpus-wide lapse level is pinned by Exp5/Exp10; I left it alone rather than trade three fits for one.

Hand-computed predictions after the edit (real in parentheses): .283 (.282), .226 (.174), .285 (.286), .156 (.150), .738 (.743), .500 (.507), ~.45 (.438), .761 (.770), .779 (.819), ~.415 (.418). Sum of squared deviations drops from ~.0113 to ~.0067, i.e. an expected aggregate loss near .026 versus the .0322 floor. Widening eps0/rho/capture around unchanged centres leaves those point estimates intact while roughly doubling simulated between-subject spread, addressing the variance criticism.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0322 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0224 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0224.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: This candidate is by far the best-fitting theory in the corpus: it lands within ~0.03 of the observed value on 7 of 10 experiments and is the only account that simultaneously nails the anti-validity one-reason designs (Exp1 .280 vs .282; Exp3 .274 vs .286; Exp4 .188 vs .150), the near-tied-validity 'salient row' designs (Exp8 .749 vs .770; Exp9 .765 vs .819), the sub-chance recency-weighted conflict design (Exp10 .406 vs .418), the dominance ceiling (Exp5 .747 vs .743), the coin-flip duplicated-label design (Exp6 .488 vs .507) and the last-row adherence design (Exp7 .448 vs .438). pi_5 catastrophically missed Exp8/Exp9 (~.49) and pi_6 catastrophically missed Exp10 (.739 vs .418); MDSC-NV removes both failures at once, which is exactly the experiment-invariance the loop is trying to surface. The two commitments doing the work \u2014 weak positional gain (pos_ratio\u2248.12, i.e. lam far below the doubt term's dynamic range) and the all-or-none label-degeneracy gate \u2014 both check out empirically: the .004/.005-gap designs stay position-arbitrated while the exact-duplicate design collapses to chance. Residual misfit is concentrated in two places. (i) Exp2: the tally-vs-TTB contrast is over-predicted (.251 vs .174) \u2014 the model is still a bit too tally-decisive on the |margin|>=2 conflict trials of the [.6,.93,.55,.87,.7,.78] design (or too weakly TTB-following on the ties). (ii) Exp9: salient-row adherence is under-predicted (.765 vs .819) while Exp8 is also slightly low (.749 vs .770), i.e. the near-tied-validity displays are being compressed toward chance a touch too much by the load lapse / capture term. Exp4 is also ~.04 too high. Separately, subject-level variances are systematically smaller than the human ones (Exp3 .006 vs .016, Exp5 .007 vs .017, Exp9 .003 vs .007), indicating too little between-subject dispersion in the sampled parameters.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED and the mechanism family (MDSC + weak positional tie-break + all-or-none degeneracy gate + load lapse, plus the null-verdict capture addition) is clearly the right one \u2014 do NOT change families, and do not touch the parts that already fit (Exp1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10 are essentially exact). I am asking for one more round only because there is identifiable, targeted headroom in three metrics, all reachable with in-family knob adjustments: (1) Exp9/Exp8 are ~.05/.02 too low: nudge pos_ratio up modestly (e.g. 0.12\u21920.13-0.16) and/or shave eps0 down slightly (0.21-0.27 \u2192 0.19-0.24) so the .958/.954/.950 and .955/.950/.945 displays stay decisive, but re-check that Exp1 stays ~.28 and Exp10 stays ~.41 \u2014 if raising pos_ratio starts pushing Exp10 above ~.45 the doubt term is no longer dominating, so back off. (2) Exp2 contrast is .076 too high, the single largest residual: raise the capture probability q a little (0.30-0.40 \u2192 0.35-0.48) so that displays whose doubt-leader is silent are pulled further toward chance on the high-margin conflict trials, and/or lower rho slightly so 4-row conflict displays lapse more; the target is p_tally - p_ttb_tie \u2248 .17. (3) Exp4 is ~.04 high: a slightly larger doubt_gain (12-15) makes the v=.53 column strictly decisive there and should shift it toward .15 without harming Exp3. Finally, widen the sampling ranges of eps0/capture (not the structural parameters) so that between-subject variance rises toward the human values \u2014 the current simulated per-subject variance is 2-3x too small on Exps 3, 5, 9, which suggests too-homogeneous simulated subjects. Verify all ten hand-computed predictions before submitting; if none of these knobs improves aggregate loss, ship the current version.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0322 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0224 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

  "interpretation": "The candidate (iter 2) is comfortably the best-fitting account in the corpus and was ACCEPTED (loss .0322 -> .0224). It is within ~.02 of the observed value on 8 of 10 experiments and is the only theory that simultaneously reproduces (a) the strongly anti-validity one-reason designs (Exp1 .266 vs .282, Exp3 .294 vs .286, Exp4 .152 vs .150), (b) the near-tied-label 'salient row' designs (Exp8 .750 vs .770, Exp9 .778 vs .819) where pi_5 sat at chance, (c) the sub-chance recency/validity-weighted conflict design (Exp10 .402 vs .418) where pi_6 badly overshot (.739), (d) the dominance ceiling (Exp5 .743 vs .743), (e) the exact-duplicate-label coin flip (Exp6 .488 vs .507) and (f) last-row adherence (Exp7 .439 vs .438). The sharpened doubt_gain (13-17) plus the modest capture increase did exactly what my prior critique asked on Exp4 (+.038 -> +.002) and roughly halved the Exp2 residual (+.076 -> +.041), so the direction was right and should not be reversed. Two residuals remain and they pull against each other under a single global lapse: Exp2's tally-minus-TTB contrast is still ~.04 too HIGH (model too decisive on the |margin|>=2 conflict trials and/or not TTB-decisive enough on the ties), while Exp8/Exp9 salient-row adherence is ~.02/.04 too LOW (near-tied-label displays over-compressed toward chance). Global lapse reduction fixes Exp8/9 but would push Exp1 (.266, already .016 below), Exp10 (.402, .016 below) and Exp6 (.488, .019 below) further from their observed values, which is why the proposer correctly refused a blanket eps0 cut. A second, systematic issue: simulated between-subject variance is still 2-3x too small on most metrics (Exp3 .007 vs .016, Exp5 .006 vs .017, Exp8 .0025 vs .0057, Exp9 .0017 vs .0074) despite the widened ranges \\u2014 the simulated population is more homogeneous than the human one.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The mechanism family (MDSC + weak positional tie-break + all-or-none label-degeneracy gate + load lapse + null-verdict capture) is faithful to the arbiter's prescription and must be kept unchanged \\u2014 do not touch predict's structure or the parts that already fit essentially exactly (Exp4, Exp5, Exp7, Exp3). I ask for one more tuning round only because there is a specific, in-family knob that has NOT yet been tried and that dissolves the Exp8/9-vs-Exp1/6/10 trade-off my earlier (declined) eps0/pos_ratio suggestions ran into: make the lapse DECISIVENESS-modulated rather than purely load-driven. Concretely, keep p(guess) = 1-(1-eps0)*rho^(m-2) but multiply the guessing rate by a factor that shrinks when the doubt competition among the discriminating rows is near-degenerate (e.g. g_eff = g * (H(t)/log m)^psi, or equivalently g_eff = g*(1-psi*(1-max_j t_j)) with a small psi in [0.2,0.6]). In the .955/.950/.945 and .958/.954/.950 designs the doubt leader wins the softmax by 2.5-3.7 log units, so g_eff drops and Exp8/Exp9 rise toward .77/.82; in Exp2's 4-row conflict displays and Exp1/Exp10's mixed-validity conflicts the doubt mass is more spread, so g_eff stays where it is and those already-good fits are preserved. Sanity-check that Exp1 stays >= .27, Exp10 stays ~.41 and Exp5 does not exceed ~.76 before submitting. Second, for the remaining Exp2 residual take a SMALL further step in the direction that already worked \\u2014 do NOT jump: capture from ~.41 to ~.44-.47 (upper end .52 max) and/or rho down by ~.02, aiming for p_tally-p_ttb_tie ~= .18-.19; note this also nudges Exp1 up from .266 toward .282, so the two residuals are aligned here. Explicitly do NOT re-raise pos_ratio (that push was already argued down and would blunt the Exp2 tie trial) and do NOT apply a blanket eps0 cut. Third, address the variance shortfall by widening the sampling ranges of the *nuisance* parameters only (eps0 ~[.15,.33], rho ~[.72,.88], capture ~[.30,.52], and allow doubt_gain to spread [11,19]) while keeping their centres where they are, so per-subject metric variance roughly doubles without moving the pooled point estimates. If none of these edits improves aggregate loss below .0224, ship the current version \\u2014 the gate will protect the base either way."
