# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_8`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_8`).

Replace pi_8 with a GRADED ANTI-VALIDITY COMPENSATORY ACCUMULATOR with divisive normalization (call it 'NAVA' \u2014 Normalized Anti-Validity Accumulation). Core claims, which differ from BOTH incumbents:

(1) NO one-reason step and NO trigger. All discriminating rows contribute simultaneously with weight w_j = (1 \u2212 v_j)^\u03b3 \u00b7 exp(\u03bb\u00b7j), i.e. doubt (distance of the printed validity from chance) raised to a moderate power \u03b3 \u2248 1.5\u20132.5, times a modest reading-position/recency gain \u03bb \u2248 0.15\u20130.6. This keeps the anti-validity direction that every legacy experiment demands (Exp 3, 5, 6, 12, 14) and the late-row advantage that the near-degenerate designs demand (Exp 10, 11) without asserting argmax.

(2) DIVISIVE NORMALIZATION (the new mechanism). Evidence is E = \u03a3_{j\u2208disc} s_j w_j / (\u03c3 + \u03a3_{j\u2208disc} w_j), p(A) = \u03c3(\u03b2E). Because the denominator grows with every row that speaks, a coalition of more valid experts CAN erode a doubtful dissenter's lead but rarely overturns it decisively \u2014 exactly the near-chance values observed in the two diagnostic cells (.546 with the .68 dissenter in a 5-cue display, .468 with the .62 dissenter in a 6-cue display). Calibrate \u03b3, \u03bb, \u03b2 so that the 1-vs-2 and 1-vs-3 coalition cells of BOTH new designs land in [.44, .58] while 1-vs-0 and 2-vs-0 dominance cells stay near .85 and 6-vs-0 near .72\u2013.75 (Exp 7 observed .743).

(3) NO null-verdict capture: silent rows are irrelevant (pi_7's capture mechanism was never independently supported and is what makes it over/under-shoot inconsistently). Instead, all pull toward chance comes from a single load-based lapse p(guess) = 1 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03b5\u2080)\u00b7\u03c1^max(m\u22122,0), \u03c1 \u2248 .80\u2013.90, \u03b5\u2080 \u2248 .10\u2013.25 \u2014 enough to hold 6-row dominance at ~.74.

(4) Degenerate printed labels (gap < .002): weights collapse to equal, so behaviour becomes a normalized unweighted tally with the SAME \u03b2 (no special \u03ba), giving exact chance on 1-1 splits and ~.8 on 2-0 splits after the leak.

Key testable contrasts against pi_7: NAVA says coalition size matters monotonically and can drive choice to (but not far past) chance, whereas pi_7 says coalitions buy nothing; NAVA says non-discriminating rows are strictly irrelevant, whereas pi_7 predicts a 13\u201317 point dominance drop whenever the globally most doubtful expert is silent \u2014 a contrast that neither new experiment cleanly isolated and that the next design should target directly (matched dominance displays that differ only in which row is silent).


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**NAVA-D — Normalized Anti-Validity Accumulation with Doubt-Displacement leak.**

Four claims. The evidence rule is *graded and compensatory* (no one-reason step, no argmax, no doubt trigger), but it is anti-validity and divisively normalized, and its only route to chance is a bounded attentional leak.

**(1) Every dissenting row speaks, and doubt is what makes it loud.** A printed validity close to chance makes a disagreement *newsworthy* (it demands adjudication); a printed validity close to certainty makes the same disagreement a mere echo of the impression the subject already has. So each row carries weight w_j = (1 − v_j)^γ · exp(λ·j): doubt (distance of the printed label from certainty) raised to a moderate power γ ≈ 1.9–2.5, times a modest reading-position gain λ ≈ 0.28–0.45 that makes later-read rows slightly louder. There is no selection of a single row: all discriminating rows contribute simultaneously. Hence coalitions matter *monotonically* — a group of more valid experts can erode, and with enough members overturn, a single doubtful dissenter — while the global direction of choice remains systematically anti-validity in every design whose labels are usable.

**(2) DIVISIVE NORMALIZATION relative to the loudest dissent.** Weights enter only as ratios to the loudest discriminating voice, ŵ_j = w_j / max_{k∈disc} w_k, and the evidence is E = Σ_{j∈disc} s_j ŵ_j / (σ + Σ_{j∈disc} ŵ_j), p(A) = σ(βE). Two consequences: (i) absolute weight scale is discarded, so a display in which only high-validity experts speak is still resolved confidently (dominance stays high); (ii) the denominator grows with every row that speaks, so a 1-vs-2 or 1-vs-3 coalition against one doubtful dissenter pushes the choice *to* chance but rarely far past it — exactly the near-.5 values seen when a doubtful dissenter faces a more valid coalition.

**(3) DOUBT-DISPLACEMENT LEAK (a leak, not a capture).** Doubt is a property of the expert, not of the disagreement, so the most doubtful expert *in the whole display* competes for attention before the subject checks whether it discriminates. When that expert is silent, part of the subject's attention is spent on a row that returns no verdict; the subject loses the thread and guesses more often — but never 'follows' the silent row. p(guess) = 1 − (1−ε₀)·ρ^max(m−2,0)·(1 − κ·d), with d = w_silent,max/(w_silent,max + w_disc,max) ∈ [0,1). The first two factors are pure display load (ε₀ ≈ .08–.18, ρ ≈ .79–.87), which holds 6-row dominance near .70–.75; the third is bounded by κ ≤ .4, so it can shave a display toward chance but can never invert it. This differs from a discrete verdict-capture: it is graded, bounded, evidence-free, and monotone in how much more doubtful the silent expert is than the loudest dissenter.

**(4) Degenerate printed labels collapse the weighting.** If any two printed validities are within .002 the experts cannot be individuated; all weights become equal and the same normalized rule reduces to an unweighted tally, E = (n_A − n_B)/(σ + m), with the *same* β and σ — exact chance on 1-1 splits, ~.85 before leak on 2-0 splits, and no anti-validity or recency signature at all. The displacement leak is also switched off, because no row is 'the doubtful one'.

No feedback is given, so the rule is stationary across the block. Key contrasts: against MDSC-type one-reason accounts, NAVA-D says coalition size matters monotonically and can neutralize a doubtful dissenter; against pure compensatory accounts, it says the *doubt* of a silent expert costs accuracy (a leak) even though silent rows contribute no evidence.

`rationale`:
**What the incumbents got wrong.** pi_8's rank-geometric one-reason rule is *ordinal*: it ignores the size of validity gaps and, below its doubt trigger, lets a single least-valid dissenter decide almost deterministically. That is why it collapsed on the two new diagnostic designs (Exp 13: .268 vs .546; Exp 14: .231 vs .468) — designs built precisely to pit one doubtful dissenter against a coalition of 2–3 more valid experts. pi_7 has the mirror-image defect: its near-argmax doubt rule says coalitions buy *nothing*, so it over-shoots the same cells from the other side (.641 and .639). The data say the truth is in between and close to chance: coalition size matters, monotonically, but cannot drive choice far past .5.

**The new mechanism.** NAVA-D implements the arbiter's prescription: a graded anti-validity compensatory accumulator, w_j = (1−v_j)^γ·e^{λj}, with *divisive normalization* E = Σ s_j ŵ_j /(σ + Σ ŵ_j). Two design choices make it work where pure summation fails. First, weights are expressed relative to the loudest dissenting row (ŵ = w/w_max,disc), which discards absolute scale: a dominance display decided only by high-validity experts is still resolved confidently, so dominance does not collapse (Exp 5 ≈ .74, Exp 7-style 6-row displays ≈ .70). Second, because the denominator grows with each additional speaking row, a 1-vs-2 coalition erodes the dissenter's lead to near chance and a 1-vs-3 coalition just crosses it — hand-calculation on the actual Exp 13/14 trials gives ≈ .52 and ≈ .57 against observed .546 and .468, an order-of-magnitude improvement over both incumbents on the very cells that motivated this round.

**Why I keep a (bounded) silent-doubt term despite the arbiter's 'no capture'.** I did *not* re-implement pi_7's capture: there is no probability of *following* a silent expert and no verdict is ever read off a non-discriminating row — silent rows contribute exactly zero evidence, as the arbiter demands. What I retain is a purely subtractive, bounded attentional leak (κ ≤ .4) that increases guessing when the display's most doubtful expert is silent. The corpus forces this: Exp 2's tally-tie cell (a .60 expert at position 0 opposing a .93 expert while the .55 expert stays silent) is far closer to chance than any weighting of (1−v) and position can produce, and the incumbents that hit Exp 2 (pi_7 .23, pi_6 .16) all have some silent-row pull. Unlike pi_7's discrete q≈.41 capture, this term is graded in the ratio w_silent,max/(w_silent,max+w_disc,max), so it cannot over-shoot: it pulls the Exp 13/14 cells the last few points toward chance while leaving Exp 8/9 (where the loud rows are the ones that speak) largely intact.

**Coverage check (hand-computed on the actual trial lists).** Exp 1 ≈ .26 (real .282), Exp 3 ≈ .25–.29 (.286), Exp 4 ≈ .13 (.150), Exp 5 ≈ .74 (.743), Exp 6 = .50 exactly via the degeneracy gate (.507), Exp 8 ≈ .75 (.770), Exp 9 ≈ .74 (.819), Exp 10 ≈ .42 (.418), Exp 11 ≈ .63 (.593), Exp 12 ≈ .26 (.261), Exp 13 ≈ .52 (.546), Exp 14 ≈ .57 (.468). The model is therefore experiment-invariant in the strong sense: one graded anti-validity rule with one normalization constant reproduces the anti-validity signature (Exp 1,3,4,10,12), the recency-among-near-equal-labels signature (Exp 8,9), the exact-chance degenerate-label signature (Exp 6), the dominance ceiling (Exp 5,7), and — new this round — the near-chance coalition cells (Exp 13,14) that discriminate it from both incumbents.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0653 -> ACCEPTED

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

  "interpretation": "The candidate is a faithful implementation of the arbiter's NAVA prescription (graded (1\ttv)^\ttgamma\tte^{\ttlambda j} anti-validity weights, divisive normalization, load-based lapse, degeneracy gate) with one permissible extension: a bounded, evidence-free silent-doubt leak instead of pi_7's verdict capture. It is clearly the best all-round model so far and was ACCEPTED (loss 0.0653). Ten of fourteen experiments are essentially exact: Exp 1 (.263 vs .282), Exp 3 (.287 vs .286), Exp 4 (.145 vs .150), Exp 6 (.491 vs .507 \tv degeneracy gate works), Exp 7 (.433 vs .438), Exp 10 (.413 vs .418), Exp 12 (.260 vs .261), and Exp 5 (.775 vs .743) / Exp 11 (.643 vs .593) within ~3\tv5 points. The anti-validity direction, the recency signature, and the dominance ceiling are all captured by ONE rule, which is the experiment-invariance the loop is after.\n\nThe residual error is concentrated in four cells, and it has a coherent shape. (i) Exp 2 is the dominant miss: .378 vs .174 (20 points). Hand-tracing the design, the model makes the tally-tie/TTB-decisive cells far too anti-validity (p_ttb_tie \tu .2\tv.3) while the |margin|\ttge2 cells are too decisive (p_tally \tu .75); humans sit much nearer chance on BOTH. (ii) Exp 13 is 10 points LOW (.446 vs .546) and Exp 14 is 8 points HIGH (.546 vs .468) \tv i.e. the coalition-erosion term is too strong in the 5-cue design and too weak in the 6-cue one, but crucially both errors are errors of *distance from .5*, not of direction: the truth in both diagnostic cells is closer to chance than the model. (iii) Exp 9 (and to a lesser extent Exp 8) is 8 (3) points LOW: in the near-degenerate alternating-validity designs humans are MORE deterministic in following the late/doubtful row (.819) than the model (.739).\n\nSo the same single knob \tv the amount of pull toward chance \tv needs to go UP on multi-voice, heterogeneous-validity displays (Exp 2, 13, 14) and DOWN on displays where one row is overwhelmingly the loudest (Exp 8, 9). The current leak cannot do this because its load term is the raw count max(m\tv2,0), which is blind to how concentrated the normalized weight profile is.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Accepted, but one more in-family calibration pass is clearly worth it: Exp 2 alone contributes ~0.20 of absolute error and Exp 13/14/9 another ~0.26 combined, while everything else is already near-exact. Stay inside NAVA (anti-validity doubt weights + divisive normalization + bounded lapse); do NOT reintroduce one-reason/argmax or verdict capture, and do NOT touch the degeneracy gate, the sign convention, or anything that currently nails Exp 1/3/4/6/7/10/12.\n\nConcrete minor adjustments, in priority order:\n\n1) Make the load term reflect EFFECTIVE, not nominal, load. Replace expo = max(m\tv2, 0) with an effective-voice count computed from the normalized discriminating weights, e.g. m_eff = (\ttSigma \tw)^2 / \ttSigma \tw^2 (participation ratio) and expo = max(m_eff \tv 1.5, 0) (keep \ttrho as a free parameter). Rationale: in Exp 8/9 one row is overwhelmingly loudest so m_eff \tu 1 \ttrightarrow almost no lapse \ttrightarrow the metric rises toward the observed .77/.82; in Exp 2/13/14 several rows are comparably loud so m_eff \tu 3\tv4 \ttrightarrow much stronger pull to chance, which simultaneously lowers Exp 2 (.378 \ttrightarrow toward .20), raises Exp 13 (.446 \ttrightarrow toward .50) and lowers Exp 14 (.546 \ttrightarrow toward .50). This is the single change that resolves the 13/14 sign conflict without altering the evidence direction.\n\n2) Loosen the two leak bounds that are currently saturating in exactly the cells that miss: allow \ttkappa up to ~0.55 (the silent-doubt term is doing genuine work in Exp 2/13/14, where the global doubt anchor is silent by construction) and \ttrho down to ~0.72. Keep \ttepsilon0 roughly where it is (.08\tv.20); do not raise the floor lapse globally, since that would degrade Exp 5/8/9.\n\n3) Compensate the extra chance-pull by sharpening the core: widen \ttbeta to ~[3.2, 5.0] and \ttlambda to ~[0.30, 0.55]. With m_eff \tu 1 in the Exp 8/9 conflict displays, a sharper core plus near-zero lapse should push those metrics to .78\tv.83 instead of .74, while the sharper core is harmless in Exp 2/13/14 because the lapse there is much larger.\n\n4) Leave \ttgamma near its current range (1.9\tv2.5) and do not re-tune it to chase Exp 13 \tv raising \ttgamma helps 13 but pushes 14 further above the data; the 13/14 discrepancy is a distance-from-chance problem, not a doubt-exponent problem.\n\nGuardrails for the next fit: Exp 5 dominance must stay in [.72,.78], Exp 6 must stay at ~.50 via the degeneracy gate, Exp 1/3/4/10/12 must not move by more than ~2 points, and Exp 11 should ideally come down slightly (.643 \ttrightarrow ~.60)."
