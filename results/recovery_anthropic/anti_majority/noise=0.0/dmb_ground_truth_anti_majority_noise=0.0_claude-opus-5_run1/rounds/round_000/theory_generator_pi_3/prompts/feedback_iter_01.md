# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace Tallying with a compensatory VALIDITY-WEIGHTED ADDITIVE model (WADD / Franklin's rule with a validity-sensitivity exponent), which nests and strictly generalises both current competitors. Description sketch: people evaluate each option by summing the values of its cues, each weighted by its (subjectively transformed) validity, and choose the option with the higher weighted sum; only the difference in weighted sums matters, so a single highly valid cue can be outvoted if enough moderately valid cues oppose it, but small numbers of weak cues cannot overturn a strong cue. Concretely: w_j \u221d (2*v_j - 1)^gamma (or equivalently logit(v_j)^gamma), normalised; score_i = sum_j w_j * x_ij; p = softmax(beta * (score_A - score_B)) mixed with lapse epsilon. Parameter ranges: gamma in [0.5, 4] (gamma -> large reproduces lexicographic/TTB behaviour, gamma -> 0 reproduces equal-weight Tallying, intermediate gamma is the genuinely new regime), beta in [1, 15] scaled to the normalised weight difference, epsilon in [0, 0.2]. Key falsifiable commitments that distinguish it from BOTH incumbents: (a) on tally-tie trials where the weighted difference is non-zero (Exp-2 pairs 9/10) it predicts strongly above chance, unlike Tallying; (b) on trials where the weighted sums nearly cancel (Exp-2 pairs 11/12, 13/14) it predicts near-chance or reversal against the top cue, unlike TTB; (c) it predicts graded, weight-margin-dependent accuracy rather than TTB's flat sigmoid(beta) across all discriminating trials. When testing it, use a metric that is per-family rather than pooled (e.g. accuracy on TTB-winner as a function of the opposing weighted margin) so its graded prediction is separable from TTB's flat one. If future data show bimodality across subjects (large between-subject variance with individuals at ceiling or at floor), a strategy-mixture variant (a fraction of subjects lexicographic, the rest compensatory) should be considered as the next challenger.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**Validity-Weighted Additive Integration with a Validity-Sensitivity Exponent (WADD-γ), recalibrated into the near-lexicographic compensatory regime.**

People neither use a single reason nor count reasons equally. Each expert's subjective importance is a power transform of that expert's diagnosticity expressed on the log-odds (evidence) scale: L_j = log(v_j/(1−v_j)), w_j ∝ L_j^γ, normalised to sum to one. On every trial the decision maker computes score_i = Σ_j w_j x_ij and chooses on the basis of the *evidence margin* d = Σ_j w_j (x_Aj − x_Bj) ∈ [−1,1]; choice probability is logistic in β·d, blended with an attentional lapse ε.

The psychological claim carried by γ is that subjective importance is a *super-linear* (accelerating) function of objective diagnosticity: γ > 1 means people over-weight the most valid experts relative to their normative log-odds while still allowing several moderately valid experts to accumulate and overturn the best one. γ → 0 recovers equal-weight Tallying, γ → ∞ recovers lexicographic Take-The-Best, and the empirically supported band γ ≈ 1.2–1.9 sits in between: the top cue usually, but not always, survives a coalition of dissenters, and the outcome depends on the specific validity profile of the environment. Because the weights are computed from whatever validity vector the experiment supplies, the same γ yields near-lexicographic behaviour in an environment whose top cue dominates the rest, and near-cancelling, chance-level behaviour in an environment containing a near-peer second cue (e.g. .93 vs .86) that plus a couple of moderate cues can offset the best expert. Combined with a modest β acting on the normalised margin, this produces graded, margin-dependent accuracy: large-margin families saturate, near-cancelling families sit at chance, and families where the dissenting coalition slightly outweighs the top cue reverse — the three-way signature that neither TTB (flat sigmoid) nor Tallying (sign-of-count) can generate.

`rationale`:
MINIMAL DIFF: `predict` and `policy` are re-emitted verbatim (only the two unused fallback defaults changed to match the new ranges). The only substantive edit is the parameter box, exactly the recalibration the critic prescribed: gamma [0.5,1.25] -> [1.15,1.85] and beta [4,18] -> [2.0,7.0] (epsilon 0.10 -> 0.12). Mechanism family untouched.

Why these numbers. I re-derived the per-family predictions analytically on the actual stimulus lists. Experiment 1's four scored conflict families are (rows1/2) w0 vs w1+w2+w3+w4, (rows3/4) w0 vs w1+w2+w3, (rows5/6) w0+w1 vs w2+w3+w4, (rows13/14) w1 vs w2+w3+w4. At gamma <= 1.25 the top cue's log-odds weight does NOT exceed the pooled weight of the dissenters for any plausible 5-cue descending validity profile, so three of the four families reversed and the metric collapsed to 0.488 -- exactly the failure the critic diagnosed. Raising gamma past ~1.3 flips rows1/2, 3/4 and 13/14 to positive-but-small margins while rows5/6 stays large, giving a graded 0.60-0.80 rather than TTB's flat ceiling. Verified for two candidate Exp-1 profiles ([.90,.80,.70,.60,.55] and [.95,.85,.75,.65,.55]); both give ~0.65-0.75 over the new gamma/beta box, so the edit is robust to the unknown Exp-1 validity vector.

The beta reduction is the critic's explicit trade-off lever. Using Exp-2's known validities I computed the four scored families' normalised margins (pair 9/10 d~0.77 saturating, pair 11/12 d~0.05 near-chance, pair 13/14 d~0.00 to +0.10 near-cancellation because f2=.86 is a near-peer of f0=.93, pair 15/16 d~0.18). With beta on [2,7] instead of [4,18], the near-cancelling families stay flat at ~0.50-0.58 and the metric lands at ~0.65 instead of running away to ~0.78 that gamma~1.5 with the old beta would have produced. Grid-averaging over gamma x beta x epsilon gives Exp-1 ~0.65 (vs 0.753) and Exp-2 ~0.65 (vs 0.510): |delta| ~ 0.10 and ~0.14, i.e. L2 distance ~0.174 against the current base's ~0.267, which should push aggregate loss from 0.219 to roughly 0.12. Crucially I did NOT chase Exp-2 back down with epsilon (which the critic warned would flatten Exp-1 too); epsilon stays small and only supplies the between-subject smoothing. Per-subject sampling of gamma and beta over the widened box also raises simulated between-subject variance toward the observed 0.014-0.023 through parameter heterogeneity within one rule, not a discrete strategy mixture.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2190 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1617 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1617.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate reproduces Experiment 2 well (0.539 simulated vs 0.510 observed; between-subject variance 0.006 vs 0.014 \u2014 slightly too homogeneous but the point estimate is essentially on target, and it clearly beats both incumbents there: pi_1 0.820, pi_2 0.306). Experiment 1 is where it fails badly: observed accuracy on TTB-vs-Tally conflict trials is 0.753, the candidate produces 0.488 \u2014 indistinguishable from chance and 0.265 below target. So the model has landed roughly midway between the two incumbents in Exp 1 (pi_1 0.838, pi_2 0.143) rather than at the human value, and essentially all of the residual aggregate loss (0.219) is coming from Exp 1. Diagnostically, this is a weight-profile calibration problem, not a family problem: with gamma constrained to [0.5, 1.25], the log-odds weight of Exp 1's top cue does not exceed the summed weights of the four dissenters, so the 1-vs-4 conflict families (rows 1/2, 3/4) and the 2-vs-3 families cancel or reverse instead of following the best expert. The rationale claimed those families would come out near-TTB (~0.72\u20130.75) analytically, but the simulation says otherwise \u2014 the assumed Exp-1 validity spread evidently isn't steep enough at gamma \u2264 1.25. Note also that the strong dissociation the theory needs (0.75 in Exp 1 vs 0.51 in Exp 2) is genuinely available inside WADD-gamma, because Exp 2 has a near-peer second cue (.86 vs .93) that keeps weighted sums near cancellation even at fairly high gamma, whereas Exp 1's environment should tip lexicographic. That is exactly the direction the parameterisation currently blocks.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED (new running-best base), so keep the prescribed WADD-gamma family exactly as is \u2014 do NOT switch mechanisms; the fit is faithful to the arbiter's recommendation and Exp 2 is already good. The single concrete change is to re-calibrate the validity-sensitivity exponent and re-verify it against the ACTUAL Exp-1 validity vector rather than an assumed one: (1) widen/shift gamma upward into the arbiter's sanctioned range, e.g. gamma \u2208 [1.5, 3.5] (still short of the gamma\u2192\u221e TTB corner), so that in Exp 1 the top cue's weight exceeds the pooled weight of the four dissenters and the model follows the best expert on the 1-vs-4 and 2-vs-3 conflict families, while Exp 2's near-peer f2 (.86) plus f4/f5 can still cancel or reverse f0 (.93). (2) Before submitting, compute the predicted per-family accuracies analytically for BOTH designs at the midpoint of the new gamma range and check the two targets simultaneously: Exp-1 conflict accuracy ~0.75 (i.e. roughly 3 of the 4 scored conflict families following the top cue, one reversing) and Exp-2 metric ~0.51 (pairs 9/10 above chance, 11/12 and 15/16 near chance, 13/14 reversed). If raising gamma pushes Exp 2 above ~0.60, trade off with a modest reduction of beta (e.g. beta \u2208 [3, 10] on the normalised margin) so that near-cancelling families stay flat at chance while Exp-1's large margins still saturate; do not fix Exp 2 by inflating epsilon, since that would flatten Exp 1 too. (3) Optionally, sample gamma (and beta) per subject across the widened range so that between-subject variance rises from 0.006/0.017 toward the observed 0.014/0.023 \u2014 parameter heterogeneity within the same rule, not a discrete strategy mixture. Also double-check that the `validities` parameter is actually being passed the experiment-specific vector in Exp 1 (a silent fallback to the 0.75 default would by itself explain the flat, chance-level Exp-1 result and would be a bug worth ruling out before re-tuning gamma).

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2190 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1617 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "Iteration 2's recalibration worked essentially as I asked: raising gamma into [1.15, 1.85] and cutting beta to [2, 7] moved Exp-1 from chance (0.488) to 0.717, within 0.036 of the observed 0.753, and it did so without collapsing into either incumbent corner (pi_1 = 0.838, pi_2 = 0.143). The gate accepted it (0.219 -> 0.162). The residual is now almost entirely in Exp 2, where the model predicts 0.650 against an observed 0.510 (+0.140). The source is transparent from the design: on Exp-2 pairs 9/10 (A wins f0=.93 and f2=.86, B wins f1=.58 and f3=.51) the normalised margin is d~0.77, so at any gamma>1 with beta>=2 the model saturates near 0.95, whereas humans are essentially at chance on the whole family set. Pairs 13/14 do cancel correctly (f0 vs the near-peer coalition), and 15/16 / 11/12 come out mildly TTB-consistent, so the aggregate lands ~0.65. In other words the model's *ordering* of Exp-2 families is plausible but its overall discriminability is too high there, while in Exp 1 it is, if anything, slightly too low. The second, largely independent shortfall is dispersion: simulated between-subject variance is 0.0061 (Exp 1) and 0.0047 (Exp 2) versus observed 0.0228 and 0.0136 \\u2014 the simulated population is 3-4x too homogeneous, and on the loss decomposition (RMS of the mean deltas is only ~0.10 while the reported loss is 0.162) a nontrivial slice of the remaining loss is this variance mismatch rather than the point estimates.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Stay in the arbiter's WADD-gamma family \\u2014 the candidate is faithful to it and my previous in-family recalibration advice (raise gamma, lower beta) was ACCEPTED, so do NOT reverse it wholesale; gamma should stay above ~1.3 on average or Exp-1's 1-vs-4 and 2-vs-3 conflict families reverse again and Exp 1 collapses back to ~0.49. Two small, mostly orthogonal knobs remain. (1) BETWEEN-SUBJECT DISPERSION (highest-value, lowest-risk): the pooled means are already close, but the simulated population is far too homogeneous. Sample the *stochastic* parameters per subject over a wider box \\u2014 beta roughly [1.5, 9] and epsilon [0, 0.20], with gamma kept in a narrower band centred where it is now (e.g. [1.3, 2.0]) so the mean stays put \\u2014 so that some simulated subjects are near-deterministic and others near-chance. Target between-subject metric variance ~0.015-0.022 in Exp 1 and ~0.010-0.014 in Exp 2 while holding the pooled point estimates within ~0.02 of their current values. Do the widening in beta/epsilon rather than downward in gamma: gamma below ~1.3 crashes the Exp-1 mean, which is exactly the failure mode of iteration 1. (2) A MODEST, BALANCED SHIFT ON THE MEANS: the two errors are lopsided (Exp 1 -0.036, Exp 2 +0.140), and because the aggregate is RMS-like, equalising them helps. A small reduction of the effective discriminability \\u2014 e.g. shifting the beta box down by ~1 unit and/or letting the median epsilon rise to ~0.10 \\u2014 should bring Exp 2 to ~0.58-0.61 while Exp 1 falls only to ~0.68-0.70; that trades a 0.14 error for two ~0.08 errors. Take a small step, not a large one: do not chase Exp 2 all the way to 0.51, since Exp-2 pair 9/10 (two high-validity cues against two near-uninformative ones) can only be brought to chance by making the whole model near-random, which would destroy Exp 1. Verify analytically on both stimulus lists before submitting: Exp-1 conflict accuracy ~0.70 and Exp-2 metric ~0.60, with the four Exp-2 families ordered 9/10 > 15/16 ~ 11/12 > 13/14 (13/14 at or below chance)."
