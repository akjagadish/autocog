# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace pi_4 entirely. Its strict-unanimity consensus premium is falsified in four independent experiments (1, 2, 7, 8) with large, sign-reversed errors; no re-parameterisation can save it, because the premium is direction-carrying and the data show the *opposite* direction at both unanimity boundaries.

Proposed replacement \u2014 'Expectation-Referenced Cue Coding (ERC)': choice is compensatory and stationary, but each displayed rating is scored relative to a subjective endorsement threshold rather than as pure positive evidence.

(1) Signed cue values: s_j = c*(logit v_j)^gamma - theta, with theta calibrated so the crossover validity v* sits around .65-.78 (person-specific). A '1' from a high-validity expert is positive evidence; a '1' from a low-validity expert is *negative* ('faint praise is damning' \u2014 an indiscriminate endorser's approval signals a mediocre product). D = sum_j s_j (a_j - b_j). This is a single mechanism that replaces both pi_4's rho-premium and pi_5's separate theta term.

(2) NO endorsement-density dilution. Instead, if any normalisation is needed, divide by a *contrast count* term (c0 + kap * number of discriminating columns), which is blind to the shared endorsement background. This is the sharp point of departure from pi_5: it predicts that 5/5-vs-4/5 (weak dissent) is strongly sub-chance (~.20, as observed in Exp 2) rather than near-chance, that single-endorsement-vs-empty and 5/5-vs-4/5 cells sit at similar depths below chance (Exp 7 diff ~0, Exp 1 diff ~0), and that pi_5's 'Family T' density ladders (matched counts, matched coherence, growing shared background) should be FLAT, not compressed \u2014 an immediately testable dissociation.

(3) Retain a readability/column-binding module, since Exps 4 and 6 require it: when the display is monotone in validity the validity-derived signed weights are used intact; when it is scrambled (or the best expert is interior) the weights are flattened toward equal weighting and a left-to-right positional gradient is recruited. Keep this direction-free (ascending or descending both cheap).

(4) Broad continuous heterogeneity in beta, gamma, theta (i.e. in the crossover validity v*), the readability coefficients and lapse; no discrete strategy switching, no learning (no feedback given).

Parameter ranges should be chosen so that: Exp 2 metric lands near 0.20-0.30; Exp 1 metric near 0.0-0.15; Exp 7 near 0; Exp 8 near -0.15; Exp 5 near -0.21; Exp 3 near 0.75; Exp 4 near 0.51; Exp 6 near 0.66. The next discriminating experiment should pit ERC against pi_5 on matched-count / matched-coherence density ladders (flat vs compressed) and on cells that vary which expert supplies the extra endorsement (ERC predicts a sign flip as v crosses v*; pi_5 predicts only a magnitude change scaled by the shared background).

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.791)

**Description**
**PWA-DD: Position-Bound Weighted Additive integration with Faint-Praise discounting and Endorsement-Density Dilution.**

Choice in binary-cue environments is always *compensatory*: on every trial the decision maker reads all displayed columns, forms a single weighted difference, and never stops early. There is no lexicographic cascade and no coherence/unanimity premium. Three claims fix the rest of the mechanism.

(1) **Weights are a mixture of validity and display position, and the mixture is governed by how readable the validity-to-column mapping is.** Stated validities must be bound to *columns*. When the display is perfectly monotone in validity (ascending or descending) that binding is trivial and people use validity-derived weights w_val ∝ logit(v_j)^γ essentially intact (the residual positional leak μ0 is small and person-specific, and in some people is exactly zero). When the column order is not monotone in validity — and especially when the best expert sits in an interior column — binding fails and people fall back almost entirely on a purely positional gradient w_pos ∝ (n−j)^λ that decays left-to-right over displayed columns. The mixture weight μ = μ0 + (1−μ0)·min(1, μ1(1−|τ|) + μ2·[best cue interior]) is therefore an *environmental* quantity, not a per-experiment fudge: it is inert (μ = μ0) whenever columns are validity-sorted, and it predicts that scrambling a sorted display converts validity-driven behaviour into position-driven behaviour and that re-sorting a scrambled display restores it. Crucially the gate SATURATES: any display that is appreciably non-monotone is read essentially positionally, with no graded validity leak surviving.

(2) **Faint-praise endorsement discounting.** Each positive endorsement carries a small fixed credibility cost θ: an option that collects more '1's is slightly *less* attractive, all else equal. This is strictly monotone in endorsement count — there is no step at unanimity. It makes a lone weak endorsement no better (often slightly worse) than an empty panel, and it makes a 5/5 panel no better than a 4/5 panel by exactly the same amount, which is why 'high-coherence' and 'low-coherence' single-cue steps move together rather than apart. θ sits just at the subjective weight of the weakest experts — close enough that a lone weak endorsement is near-neutral to mildly counter-diagnostic rather than strongly aversive — while endorsement by a strong expert still wins comfortably.

(3) **Endorsement-density dilution of decision sensitivity.** The same absolute weighted difference is less decisive when both panels are densely endorsed. Evidence is divisively normalised by the mean endorsement density T = (Σa + Σb)/2n: D = [Σ_j w_j(a_j−b_j) − θ(Σa−Σb)] / (c0 + κ·T). The dilution has TWO separable constants: a floor c0 that sets how crisply *sparse* panels are compared, and a gain κ that sets how much extra mush dense panels accrue. The floor is *not* negligible: even near-empty panels are compared with bounded, distinctly sub-ceiling determinacy, which keeps lone-endorsement-versus-empty cells close to (rather than far below) chance and preserves the graded ladder structure of sparse comparisons. Heavily endorsed panels are compared mushily. Unlike a consensus premium, dilution is *direction-blind* — it never confers an advantage on the more coherent option, it only compresses whatever advantage exists — so it produces the observed shrinkage of a fixed one-cue advantage at high endorsement backgrounds without ever predicting a unanimity bonus.

p(A) = (1−ε)·logistic(βD) + ε/2. Everyone holds the same stationary rule (no feedback is given, so nothing is learned); heterogeneity is broad and continuous — in determinacy β, validity sensitivity γ, discount θ, positional decay λ, dilution (c0, κ), lapse ε and the readability coefficients — never discrete strategy switching. The theory therefore predicts substantial between-subject spread in every conflict metric, largest where margins are intermediate.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.285)

**Description**
**WADD-γ with Positional Validity Misattribution (WADD-γ + position-default blending), with heterogeneous decision determinacy.**

People integrate cues compensatorily: each expert's subjective importance is a power transform of that expert's diagnosticity on the log-odds scale, L_j = log(v_j/(1−v_j)), w_j ∝ L_j^γ; the decision rests on the normalised evidence margin d = Σ_j w_j (x_Aj − x_Bj), with p(A) logistic in β·d and an attentional lapse ε. γ ≈ 1.15–1.85 places the decision maker in the near-lexicographic but still compensatory regime: the top expert usually survives a coalition of dissenters, but a near-peer second cue plus a couple of moderate cues can cancel or overturn it.

The substantive claim about *where the weights get attached* is retained and is the theory's main falsifiable commitment. Validities are stated verbally in the instructions, but the decision maker must bind each stated validity to a *column* of the displayed rating vector. This binding is costly and error-prone, and people fall back on a powerful display heuristic: **importance decreases from left to right** (the first-listed expert is the best one, the last-listed the worst). Subjective weights are therefore a blend, with mixing weight λ, of the correctly-bound validity weights and the weights implied by the positional default (the same weight multiset re-sorted into descending order across columns):

  w_eff ∝ (1−λ)·L_j^γ + λ·sort_desc(L^γ)_j.

This is an *environmental* prediction, not a per-experiment fudge: conflict-trial accuracy is a property of the alignment between display order and validity order, while the integration rule itself stays a single stationary compensatory WADD-γ. Concretely, (i) scramble the column order of an environment whose cues are currently presented in descending validity and conflict accuracy must fall toward (and, on some families, below) chance; (ii) re-sort the columns of a scrambled environment into descending validity and the same subjects must become sharply more accurate and more top-cue-consistent; (iii) an explicit column-labelling manipulation that makes the validity→column binding visually trivial should abolish the drop. Because the blend is the exact identity whenever columns are already validity-ordered, λ is behaviourally inert in validity-sorted environments and can only be identified by comparing environments — precisely the invariance signature the theory stakes itself on.

The third claim is about **population structure**: the same stationary rule is held by everyone, but decision determinacy is heterogeneous across people. Some subjects convert modest weighted margins into near-deterministic choices, others remain near chance on all but the most lopsided evidence. That heterogeneity is carried by the logistic gain β and by mild variation in the validity-sensitivity exponent γ, not by discrete strategy switching; the theory therefore predicts that between-subject spread in conflict accuracy should be largest in environments with intermediate margins and should shrink towards zero in environments where every conflict family is near-cancelling.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.159)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0917 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0917 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
**ERC-K: Expectation-Referenced Cue Coding with Contrast-Count Normalisation.**

Choice between two binary-cue panels is compensatory, stationary (no feedback is given, so nothing is learned) and rests on a single mechanism: **every displayed rating is scored relative to a subjective endorsement threshold, not as pure positive evidence.**

(1) *Signed cue coding.* Expert j's stated validity v_j is converted to diagnosticity on the log-odds scale, x_j = (logit v_j)^γ, and then referenced against a person-specific expectation θ = (logit v*)^γ, giving a **signed** cue value s_j = x_j − θ. A '1' from an expert above the crossover v* is positive evidence; a '1' from an expert *below* v* is genuinely *negative* evidence — approval from an indiscriminate endorser is faint praise and signals a mediocre product, and its absence is reassuring. The decision variable is the signed sum over the columns that actually differ, D ∝ Σ_j s_j (a_j − b_j). This single mechanism replaces both the consensus/unanimity premium of pi_4 and the separate uniform endorsement-discount of pi_5: it predicts, with no extra machinery, that a fully unanimous 5/5 panel is chosen *well below chance* against a 4/5 panel whose lone dissent sits on a weak expert (~.20), that a lone weak endorsement is no better than an empty panel, and that a lone strong endorsement is preferred — the *sign* of the effect flips as the endorsing expert crosses v*.

(2) *No endorsement-density dilution.* Sensitivity is normalised only by the **contrast count** K, the number of columns on which the two panels actually disagree: D = Σ_j s_j(a_j−b_j) / (c0 + κ·K). Comparison difficulty grows with how many things must be reconciled, and is *blind to the shared endorsement background*. This is the sharp point of departure from pi_5: the same one-column contrast is read with exactly the same determinacy against an empty background as against a saturated one (so 'density ladders' holding contrast and coherence fixed must be FLAT, not compressed), while multi-column contrasts are systematically compressed (so unanimity-vs-coalition comparisons regress toward chance without any coherence bonus).

(3) *Readability / column binding.* Stated validities must be bound to displayed columns. When the display is monotone in validity (ascending or descending — direction-free) binding is trivial and the signed validity values are used intact. When the mapping is scrambled — and especially when the best expert sits in an interior column — binding fails: the validity-derived values **flatten toward their mean** (equal weighting) and a left-to-right positional gradient is recruited in its place. The gate μ is an environmental quantity (a function of display monotonicity and best-cue position), inert whenever columns are validity-sorted; it therefore predicts that scrambling a sorted display converts validity-driven behaviour into near-tally / position-driven behaviour and that re-sorting restores it.

(4) *Population structure.* One stationary rule for everyone, with broad continuous heterogeneity in determinacy β, validity sensitivity γ, the crossover validity v*, contrast-normalisation (c0, κ), the readability coefficients and lapse ε. No discrete strategy switching, no learning, no consensus premium.

`rationale`: I implement the arbiter's ERC family, but first corrected an indexing error in its numeric targets: the arbiter's target list is the real value vector shifted by two experiments (its 'Exp 3 near 0.75' is Exp 1's real 0.7533, 'Exp 4 near 0.51' is Exp 2's 0.5100, etc.). I therefore targeted the *actual* observed values while keeping every mechanism the arbiter prescribed.

Why this beats the incumbents. pi_5's two catastrophic misses are Exp 7 (0.334 vs 0.0675) and Exp 8 (0.494 vs 0.205); both stem from its uniform faint-praise discount θ being too small to make a weak endorsement genuinely *aversive*, plus a density dilution that sharpens sparse cells and mushes dense ones. ERC-K fixes both with one mechanism: s_j = (logit v_j)^γ − (logit v*)^γ is strictly negative for experts below the person's crossover. Hand-computing the cells with plausible validity sets (γ=1.5, v*≈0.79, β≈0.85, c0≈0.42, κ≈0.65) gives: Exp 8 (unanimous panel vs weak-column dissent) ≈ 0.25 (real 0.205; pi_5 gave 0.494); Exp 7 P−N ≈ 0.02–0.12 (real 0.0675; pi_5 gave 0.334), because P (lone strong endorsement) and the two N cells are all K=1 contrasts read at the same determinacy — removing the density dilution removes the artificial sparse-vs-dense sharpening that inflated pi_5 there. Exp 3 gives −0.22 (real −0.208; pi_5 −0.119): the agreement cells contain a lone *weak* endorsement, which ERC pushes below chance while conflict cells (weak vs strong endorsement, opposite signs) become very easy — exactly the observed sign reversal. Exp 5 ≈ −0.07 (real −0.013) because the dense weak-dissent cell and the sparse weak-endorsement cell are both governed by the same negative s, giving a near-null contrast with no density term.

Contrast-count normalisation (c0 + κK), which replaces density dilution, does real work: it compresses the many-column conflicts of Exp 1 down from ~0.88 to ~0.75 (real 0.7533) without touching one-column cells, and it keeps the ladder structure of Exp 3/6 graded rather than saturating.

The readability module is retained because Exps 2 and 4 demand it, but with the arbiter's amendment: scrambled displays flatten validity values *toward their mean* AND recruit a centred left-to-right gradient. This dissociates the two scrambled experiments that no previous single mechanism handled together — with μ≈1 the flattening makes the equal-count conflict cells of Exp 2 land at ~0.50–0.53 (real 0.51) while the recruited gradient makes the col-0-dominated cells of Exp 4 land at ~0.62–0.63 (real 0.659). The gate is inert (μ=μ0≈0) for the monotone displays of Exps 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, so it is an environmental prediction rather than a per-experiment fudge.

The known cost is Exp 6 (predicted ≈ −0.03 vs real −0.15): two of its three contrasts are structurally zero for any background-blind difference model. I deliberately accept this: I explicitly evaluated three candidate background terms (shared-background dilution, additive background penalty, within-option averaging) and each bought ≤0.10 on Exp 6 while costing 0.10–0.20 across Exps 5, 7 and 8 combined — the same trade that made pi_5 fail. Summed absolute error across the eight metrics is ≈0.33 for ERC-K versus ≈0.74 for pi_5, so the gate should accept.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: ERC-K is clearly the best single account so far: it is the only theory that gets Exp 3 (-0.19 vs -0.21), Exp 8 (0.30 vs 0.205) and Exp 1 (0.759 vs 0.753) into the right region simultaneously, and it does so with the prescribed mechanism (signed expectation-referenced cue values + contrast-count normalisation + an environment-gated readability module). Cell-by-cell errors: Exp1 +0.006, Exp2 +0.027, Exp3 +0.020, Exp4 -0.054, Exp5 -0.052, Exp7 +0.105, Exp8 +0.095, Exp6 +0.148. So six of eight experiments are essentially fit; the residual loss (0.0917) is dominated by two related failures, both in the *same direction*: the model does not make weak/low-validity endorsements aversive enough, and it over-compresses (or fails to differentiate) many-column contrasts.

Exp 8 (0.30 vs 0.205) and Exp 7 (0.173 vs 0.068) are the same miscalibration: with vstar in [0.73,0.85] and gamma ~1.5, the signed value s_j for mid-validity experts is only mildly negative, so unanimous-vs-weak-dissent panels sit only slightly below chance and the lone-strong-endorsement cell P stays too far above the N cells. Both errors point the same way (candidate too high), so a single knob \u2014 pushing the crossover vstar up (and/or gamma up) so more of the displayed panel falls below the expectation reference \u2014 moves both toward the data.

Exp 6 (-0.003 vs -0.150) is claimed to be structurally unreachable, but that claim is only true for the U and V contrasts (identical difference vectors, different backgrounds, which are indeed 0 for any background-blind model). The L contrast is NOT structurally zero: L1 (lone col2 vs lone col0, K=2) versus L4 (lone col2 vs a four-column weak coalition, K=5). Under ERC with a sufficiently high crossover, the weak coalition is *net negative evidence*, so L4 should be HIGHER than L1 \u2014 giving a negative L1-L4 of roughly -0.45 and hence a metric near -0.15 with U=V=0. The current parameterisation kills this because kappa (0.45-0.85) compresses the K=5 cell hard toward chance, cancelling exactly the effect ERC predicts. So Exp 6 is reachable inside the prescribed family; it is a normalisation-strength problem, not a missing-mechanism problem.

Exp 4 (-0.054) and Exp 5 (-0.052) are close enough that they should be treated as constraints not targets.
Rationale: Stay in the arbiter's ERC family \u2014 the candidate is faithful to it and should be kept as the base; only re-tune two knobs, do NOT add a shared-background dilution term (that is out of family and is what sank pi_5 on Exps 7/8).

(1) Deepen the expectation reference. Raise the crossover range to roughly vstar in [0.78, 0.90] (and allow gamma up to ~1.9). This makes mid/low-validity endorsements genuinely aversive, which pushes Exp 8 down from 0.30 toward the observed 0.205 and lowers the lone-endorsement cell P in Exp 7, shrinking P-N from 0.17 toward the observed 0.07. Both current errors are same-signed and this is the single knob that fixes both.

(2) Weaken the contrast-count compression. Lower kappa to roughly [0.25, 0.60] (and c0 to ~[0.30, 0.70]) so that the K=5 cell of Exp 6 (lone strong cue vs a four-column weak coalition) is not flattened to chance. With a higher vstar the coalition becomes net-negative evidence, so L4 > L1 and L1-L4 goes strongly negative; averaged with the two structurally-zero U/V contrasts this lands the Exp 6 metric near the observed -0.15 without any background term. Verify explicitly that L4 exceeds L1 in the simulation \u2014 that is the diagnostic.

(3) Protect the fits you already have. Reducing kappa and raising vstar will both push Exp 1 up (currently 0.759 vs 0.753) and Exp 2 up (0.537 vs 0.510). Compensate by lowering the beta band (e.g. [0.40, 1.00]) and/or widening lapse eps to ~[0.02, 0.16], and re-check Exp 3 (target -0.21) and Exp 5 (target -0.013) after retuning \u2014 Exp 5 currently sits 0.05 too negative, and a slightly higher lapse in the dense-cell direction should help there too.

No change to the readability/column-binding module (Exps 2/4 are within 0.06 and it is doing its job), no learning, no discrete strategy switching, and no unanimity/coherence premium. If the retune cannot get Exp 6 below about -0.08 without costing more than 0.05 on Exps 7/8 combined, keep the vstar increase (which is the safer, same-signed fix for Exps 7 and 8) and back off the kappa change.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0917 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "**ERC-K2: Expectation-Referenced Cue Coding with a deep crossover and weak contrast-count normalisation.**\n\nChoice between two binary-cue panels is compensatory, stationary (no feedback is given, so nothing is learned) and rests on a single mechanism: **every displayed rating is scored relative to a subjective endorsement threshold, not as pure positive evidence.**\n\n(1) *Signed cue coding with a DEEP crossover.* Expert j's stated validity v_j is converted to diagnosticity on the log-odds scale, x_j = (logit v_j)^\u03b3, and referenced against a person-specific expectation \u03b8 = (logit v*)^\u03b3, giving a **signed** cue value s_j = x_j \u2212 \u03b8. The theory's substantive commitment, sharpened here, is that the crossover v* sits HIGH \u2014 above all but the top one or two experts in a typical panel (v* \u2248 .81\u2013.92). Approval from anyone appreciably less than near-certain is faint praise and is read as *negative* evidence; its absence is reassuring. Consequently a unanimous 5/5 panel loses to a 4/5 panel whose lone dissent sits on a weak expert (~.20), a lone weak endorsement is *worse* than an empty panel, and a lone strong endorsement is only mildly preferred \u2014 so the \u2018extra endorsement from a strong expert\u2019 and \u2018extra endorsement from a weak expert\u2019 cells sit close together (small positive Exp-7 contrast) rather than far apart.\n\n(2) *No endorsement-density dilution; weak contrast-count normalisation.* Sensitivity is normalised only by the **contrast count** K, the number of columns on which the two panels actually disagree: D = \u03a3_j s_j(a_j\u2212b_j) / (c0 + \u03ba\u00b7K), and \u03ba is small \u2014 multi-column contrasts are compressed only mildly, never flattened to chance. The normaliser is blind to the shared endorsement background, so density ladders holding contrast and coherence fixed must be FLAT. The weak compression is what lets a *coalition* of low-validity endorsements remain net-negative evidence: a lone top-cue endorsement is chosen MORE often when opposed by a large weak coalition (K=5) than when opposed by a single mid-validity endorsement (K=2) \u2014 the L4 > L1 reversal, a signature no consensus-premium or tallying account can produce.\n\n(3) *Readability / column binding.* Stated validities must be bound to displayed columns. When the display is monotone in validity (ascending or descending \u2014 direction-free) binding is trivial and the signed validity values are used intact. When the mapping is scrambled \u2014 especially when the best expert sits interior \u2014 binding fails: validity-derived values **flatten toward their mean** and a left-to-right positional gradient is recruited in their place (with a somewhat stronger gradient than previously assumed). The gate \u03bc is environmental, inert whenever columns are validity-sorted.\n\n(4) *Population structure.* One stationary rule for everyone, with broad continuous heterogeneity in determinacy \u03b2, validity sensitivity \u03b3, the crossover v*, the contrast normalisation (c0, \u03ba), the readability coefficients and lapse \u03b5. No discrete strategy switching, no learning, no consensus premium, no density term.",

  "rationale": "MINIMAL DIFF: the `predict`/`policy` code is re-emitted verbatim except for updated default values; the only substantive change is to five parameter ranges, exactly as the critic prescribed (deepen the crossover, weaken the contrast compression, protect Exps 1-3 by lowering beta and widening lapse), plus a modest widening of rho which the critic's Exp-6 diagnosis implies.\n\n(1) **Deepen the expectation reference**: vstar [0.73,0.85] -> [0.81,0.92], gamma up to 1.80. Hand-computation on a representative 5-cue set (validities ~{.55,.62,.70,.85,.93}, gamma 1.525 => theta ~2.57) makes mid-validity endorsements genuinely aversive: Exp 8's two admissible cells (unanimous vs weak-column dissent at K=1 and K=2) land at ~.25 and ~.20, average ~.23 (observed .205; previous .30). In Exp 7 the metric reduces algebraically to [p(s_strong) - p(s_weak)]/2; pushing theta above the second-best expert's diagnosticity moves p(s_strong) from ~.64 down to ~.45 while p(s_weak) is already floored at ~.25, shrinking the contrast to ~.09-.10 (observed .0675; previous .1725). Both previous errors were same-signed and this single knob fixes both, as the critic diagnosed.\n\n(2) **Weaken the contrast-count compression**: kap [0.45,0.85] -> [0.32,0.58], c0 [0.25,0.60] -> [0.35,0.62]. The critic's Exp-6 diagnostic is L4 > L1. With mu~1 in Exp 6 (best cue is interior => readability gate saturates) the algebra gives L1 numerator = -rho*(g_0-g_2) (pure positional, always negative for the lone-col2 option) and L4 numerator = 3*(theta - xbar) (positive once the crossover is deep). With the new bands L1 ~ .43 and L4 ~ .66-.70, i.e. L1-L4 ~ -0.25, and with the two structurally-zero U/V contrasts the metric lands near -0.08 (previous -0.003, observed -0.15). Raising rho to [1.8,3.2] deepens L1 further and simultaneously pushes Exp 4 (scrambled, positional) up from .605 toward the observed .659, since Exp 4's metric literally scores agreement with a descending-position weighting.\n\n(3) **Protect the existing fits**: raising theta and lowering kap both inflate Exp 1 (its conflict cells all have the TTB winner carrying FEWER weak endorsements, which signed coding rewards). Lowering beta to [0.25,0.60] and widening eps to [0.02,0.15] restores Exp 1 to ~.75 (observed .753) at the same time as keeping the K=1 sensitivity beta/(c0+kap) ~ .43 that Exps 5/7/8 need; Exp 5 computes to ~-0.03 (observed -0.013; previous -0.065).\n\n(4) **Accepted cost, explicitly**: the deeper crossover makes the 5-vs-0 dominance cell of Exp 3 sub-chance, so Exp 3 is expected to drift from -0.19 to about -0.28/-0.31 (observed -0.208), and Exp 2 from .537 to ~.56. I evaluated the obvious in-family remedy (a compressive count reference, theta*sgn(D)|D|^psi with psi<1) and it trades almost exactly 1:1 against Exp 6 (it is the same linear count penalty that makes the weak coalition net-negative), so it buys nothing and adds a parameter; I therefore left the mechanism untouched. Summing squared errors over the eight metrics, the projected total is ~0.019 versus ~0.049 for the accepted base, driven by simultaneous ~0.07-0.08 gains on Exps 6, 7 and 8 against ~0.09 and ~0.03 losses on Exps 3 and 2."
