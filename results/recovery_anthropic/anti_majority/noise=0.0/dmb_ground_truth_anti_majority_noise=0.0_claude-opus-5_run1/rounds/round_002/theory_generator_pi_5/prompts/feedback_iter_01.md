# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace Take-The-Best entirely with a compensatory, display-bound weighted-additive theory WITHOUT any coherence/unanimity term. Sketch:

**Name:** Position-Bound Weighted Additive integration with faint-praise endorsement discounting (PWA-FP).

**Core:** D = \u03a3_j w_eff_j (a_j - b_j) - \u03b8\u00b7(\u03a3a - \u03a3b); p(A) = (1-\u03b5)\u00b7logistic(\u03b2 D) + \u03b5/2. All cues are always integrated (no stopping rule) \u2014 this is what buys Exp 4's chance-level conflict performance and Exp 3's ~0.75.

**Weights:** w_j is a convex mixture of (i) a validity-derived weight (e.g. \u221d logit(v_j)^\u03b3) bound to the correct expert, and (ii) a purely positional weight that decays left-to-right over displayed columns, w_pos \u221d (n - j)^\u03bb. The mixture coefficient is a *free* readability parameter that should be allowed to depend on how easy the validity-to-column mapping is (near-pure validity weighting when the display is monotone in validity, near-pure positional weighting when it is scrambled, best cue in a middle column). This is deliberately close to pi_4's kappa mechanism (which the data support: Exp 5 obs -0.208, Exp 6 obs 0.659) but formulated as an explicit position-vs-validity mixture rather than a flattening-toward-equal plus a small gradient, so it can generate the strong positional dominance seen in Exp 6 (0.66) while still letting the .93 cue win in Exp 5's monotone display.

**Crucially, no consensus/coherence premium.** The rho\u00b7|2\u00b7mean-1|^q term must be dropped outright. In its place put a small, strictly MONOTONE endorsement-count discount \u03b8 (0 to ~0.05 of total weight): each extra '1' slightly lowers an option's appeal (faint-praise skepticism). This reproduces (a) Exp 1's ~0 contrast (both the 5/5-vs-4/5 cell and the single-weak-endorsement-vs-empty cell are shifted in the *same* direction, so the difference stays near zero, and can be very slightly negative), (b) Exp 2's small negative -0.15 (U4-U1 and V2-V1 near zero or slightly negative because \u03b8 penalises the higher-endorsement option equally in both cells, while L1-L4 is small once flattened weights let the 4-cue coalition partly offset the .93 cue), and (c) Exp 5's negative agree-minus-conflict value via near-chance/sub-chance responding on the weak-single-endorsement-vs-empty pair, without ever predicting the huge unanimity steps that Exps 1 and 2 refuted. Constrain \u03b8 so that the dominance anchor ([1..1] vs [0..0]) stays at ceiling.

**Parameter ranges:** \u03b2 wide (2\u201312), \u03b3 ~0.8\u20132.0, positional-mixture weight wide (0\u20130.9) and tied to display monotonicity, \u03b8 small (0\u20130.06), \u03b5 0\u20130.15. No stopping/frugality parameter, no q, no rho.

This new theory competes with pi_4 on exactly the mechanism the data can still adjudicate \u2014 smooth endorsement-count effects versus all-or-none unanimity, and flattening-toward-equal versus position-sorted re-weighting \u2014 while both remain compensatory, so future experiments will be genuinely diagnostic rather than re-testing frugality, which is now settled.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**PWA-DD: Position-Bound Weighted Additive integration with Faint-Praise discounting and Endorsement-Density Dilution.**

Choice in binary-cue environments is always *compensatory*: on every trial the decision maker reads all displayed columns, forms a single weighted difference, and never stops early. There is no lexicographic cascade and no coherence/unanimity premium. Three claims fix the rest of the mechanism.

(1) **Weights are a mixture of validity and display position, and the mixture is governed by how readable the validity-to-column mapping is.** Stated validities must be bound to *columns*. When the display is perfectly monotone in validity (ascending or descending) that binding is trivial and people use validity-derived weights w_val ∝ logit(v_j)^γ essentially intact (the residual positional leak μ0 is small and person-specific, and in some people is exactly zero). When the column order is not monotone in validity — and especially when the best expert sits in an interior column — binding fails and people fall back almost entirely on a purely positional gradient w_pos ∝ (n−j)^λ that decays left-to-right over displayed columns. The mixture weight μ = μ0 + (1−μ0)·min(1, μ1(1−|τ|) + μ2·[best cue interior]) is therefore an *environmental* quantity, not a per-experiment fudge: it is inert (μ = μ0) whenever columns are validity-sorted, and it predicts that scrambling a sorted display converts validity-driven behaviour into position-driven behaviour and that re-sorting a scrambled display restores it.

(2) **Faint-praise endorsement discounting.** Each positive endorsement carries a small fixed credibility cost θ: an option that collects more '1's is slightly *less* attractive, all else equal. This is strictly monotone in endorsement count — there is no step at unanimity. It makes a lone weak endorsement no better (usually worse) than an empty panel, and it makes a 5/5 panel no better than a 4/5 panel by exactly the same amount, which is why 'high-coherence' and 'low-coherence' single-cue steps move together rather than apart. Because θ exceeds the subjective weight of the weakest experts but not that of the strongest, endorsement by a weak expert is actively counter-diagnostic while endorsement by a strong expert still wins.

(3) **Endorsement-density dilution of decision sensitivity.** The same absolute weighted difference is less decisive when both panels are densely endorsed. Evidence is divisively normalised by the mean endorsement density T = (Σa + Σb)/2n: D = [Σ_j w_j(a_j−b_j) − θ(Σa−Σb)] / (c0 + κ·T). Sparse panels are compared crisply; dense panels are compared mushily. Unlike a consensus premium, dilution is *direction-blind* — it never confers an advantage on the more coherent option, it only compresses whatever advantage exists — so it produces the observed shrinkage of a fixed one-cue advantage at high endorsement backgrounds without ever predicting a unanimity bonus.

p(A) = (1−ε)·logistic(βD) + ε/2. Everyone holds the same stationary rule (no feedback is given, so nothing is learned); heterogeneity is broad and continuous — in determinacy β, validity sensitivity γ, discount θ, positional decay λ, dilution (c0, κ), lapse ε and the readability coefficients — never discrete strategy switching. The theory therefore predicts substantial between-subject spread in every conflict metric, largest where margins are intermediate.

`rationale`:
Minimal-diff calibration pass on the ACCEPTED PWA-DD base: `predict`/`policy` are re-emitted with the mechanism byte-identical (only the inert `.get()` defaults were moved to the new box mid-points); every change is in the parameter ranges.

1. **Deepen Exp 3 (-0.126 -> target -0.208) with TWO levers instead of one.** The critic's single lever (raise theta) has a hidden cost: theta also erodes the [1..1] vs [0..0] dominance anchor (5*theta subtracted) and flips Exp 5 positive, and in Exp 1 theta happens to favour the TTB winner on *every* conflict family (the TTB winner always has fewer endorsements there), so a large theta would push Exp 1 further above its already-too-high 0.788. I therefore raise theta only moderately (0.06-0.14 -> 0.08-0.16, mid 0.10 -> 0.12) and add a second, surgically targeted lever: **lower mu0** (0.02-0.20 -> 0.0-0.14, mid 0.11 -> 0.07). mu0 is the residual positional leak and it is *only* active in monotone displays (Exps 1, 3, 5); in Exps 2, 4 and 6 the readability gate saturates at mu=1 so mu0 is arithmetically inert there. In Exp 3 the display is ASCENDING, so the positional leak was artificially inflating the weight of the weakest expert sitting in column 0 - exactly the cell ('lone weak endorsement vs empty panel') whose sub-chance responding generates the negative agree-minus-conflict contrast. Shrinking the leak drops that cell from ~0.33 to ~0.22 and simultaneously raises the near-cancelling conflict family F, deepening the contrast to ~-0.21 by hand-calculation while leaving Exps 2/4/6 untouched and moving Exp 1/Exp 5 by <0.02.

2. **Soften Exp 4 (0.748 -> 0.659) by beta and lambda, not by mu1/mu2.** I checked the critic's mu route arithmetically and it cannot work: Exp 4 has incongruence 0.93 with an interior best cue, so even mu1=1.0, mu2=0.15 gives 1.08 and still clips to mu=1. Worse, any gate reduction big enough to desaturate Exp 4 desaturates Exp 6 (incongruence 0.60) *more*, and Exp 6's -0.150 fit depends on strong positional dominance of column 0 - precisely the drift the critic warned against. So I lower the beta box (2.8-5.8 -> 2.0-5.6, mid 4.3 -> 3.8) and flatten/widen the positional decay (lam 0.85-1.25 -> 0.70-1.20). A flatter left-to-right gradient shrinks |d| specifically in the position-dominated experiments (4 and 6) where the metric's own weighting scheme is steep, dropping Exp 4's hit rate on the three selected conflict families from ~0.72 to ~0.67 while barely touching the validity-dominated Exps 1/3/5. mu1 is nudged down only slightly (1.3-2.2 -> 1.15-2.0), which desaturates Exp 2 alone (incongruence 0.67, best cue in column 0) and lets a small validity leak nudge 0.500 toward the observed 0.510 - the critic's 'two-birds' intent, delivered through the one experiment where the gate actually has headroom.

3. **Fix the heterogeneity deficit.** Every box is widened at fixed or slightly shifted centre: beta width 3.0 -> 3.6, eps 0.13 -> 0.19 (0.03-0.22), gamma 0.6 -> 0.8, theta 0.08 -> 0.08 shifted up, c0 0.08 -> 0.10, kap 0.8 -> 1.0, lam 0.40 -> 0.50. Since beta, eps and theta are the parameters the theory itself names as the loci of continuous individual differences, this should lift per-subject metric variance from 0.006-0.009 toward the observed 0.014-0.038 without moving the pooled point estimates.

Hand-computed mid-box predictions with the new box: Exp1 0.75 (obs 0.753), Exp2 ~0.51 (0.510), Exp3 -0.21 (-0.208), Exp4 0.67-0.71 (0.659), Exp5 +0.02 (-0.013), Exp6 -0.12 (-0.150). The two largest residuals of the accepted base (Exp 3 at 0.082 and Exp 4 at 0.089) both shrink by roughly half, at the cost of ~0.015 on Exp 5, so the aggregate should fall below the 0.0557 floor.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0557 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0484 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0484.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: This candidate is by far the best-fitting model seen in this family: it is within ~0.01 of the data on Exp 2 (0.500 vs 0.510), Exp 5 (-0.028 vs -0.013) and Exp 6 (-0.143 vs -0.150), and within ~0.035 on Exp 1 (0.788 vs 0.753). Critically, it simultaneously reproduces the three patterns that split the earlier theories: the near-zero/slightly-negative unanimity contrasts (Exps 5 and 6) that killed pi_4's coherence premium, the moderate positional dominance of Exp 4 that killed pi_1's validity-locked TTB, and the negative agree-minus-conflict of Exp 3 that killed pi_2/pi_3. It is faithful to the arbiter's prescription: compensatory, all-cue integration, position-vs-validity mixture gated by display readability, monotone faint-praise discount \u03b8, no unanimity/coherence term. The one addition (density dilution) is direction-blind and does not smuggle a coherence bonus back in, so it stays inside the family.

Two residuals remain. (i) Exp 3: simulated -0.126 vs observed -0.208 \u2014 the model does not push the sparse 'single weak endorsement vs empty panel' agreement cells far enough sub-chance (or its conflict cells are not high enough), so the contrast is ~40% too shallow. (ii) Exp 4: simulated 0.748 vs observed 0.659 \u2014 the model is *too* positional/too deterministic on scrambled displays with an interior best cue; \u03bc saturates at ~1 and \u03b2 is high enough that positional WADD wins nearly always, whereas humans are noticeably noisier there.

A third, systematic issue: between-subject variance is far too small. Real var is 0.023 (Exp1), 0.014 (Exp2), 0.037 (Exp3), 0.038 (Exp4); the candidate gives 0.006, 0.006, 0.008, 0.009 \u2014 3\u20135x too homogeneous. The parameter boxes are too tight to generate the observed individual spread, and the theory itself claims heterogeneity is continuous in \u03b2, \u03b8, \u03bc, so the ranges should reflect that.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED and should be the base \u2014 do NOT redesign it. Keep the exact PWA-DD mechanism (weighted-additive, position/validity mixture gated by display readability, monotone \u03b8 discount, density dilution, no coherence term) and make three targeted, in-family knob adjustments:

1. Deepen Exp 3 (currently -0.126 vs -0.208): raise the faint-praise discount slightly, e.g. \u03b8 \u2208 [0.10, 0.18] instead of [0.06, 0.14]. This drives the sparse 'lone weak endorsement vs empty panel' agreement cells further sub-chance while leaving equal-count conflict trials inert, and (because \u0394count = 1 in both U and V cells) it largely cancels in the Exp-6 contrast and moves the two Exp-5 cells together, so the good fits there should survive. Verify the [1,1,1,1,1] vs [0,0,0,0,0] dominance anchor stays at ceiling under the upper end of the new \u03b8 box.

2. Soften Exp 4 (currently 0.748 vs 0.659): the readability gate saturates \u03bc \u2192 1 on the scrambled/interior-best display and \u03b2 is too high there. Reduce the saturation slightly \u2014 e.g. lower \u03bc1 to ~[1.0, 1.6] and \u03bc2 to ~[0.15, 0.45], and/or shift the \u03b2 box down to ~[2.2, 5.0] \u2014 so a residual fraction of validity weighting plus more choice noise pulls the positional-vs-TTB hit rate down toward 0.66. Exp 2 (also scrambled) is currently at 0.500 vs 0.510 and a small validity leak nudges it in the right direction, so this is a two-birds change; check Exp 6 does not drift positive.

3. Fix the heterogeneity deficit: widen the boxes so per-subject metric variance approaches the observed 0.014\u20130.038 rather than the current 0.006\u20130.009. Concretely widen \u03b2 (e.g. [2.0, 7.0]), \u03b5 (e.g. [0.03, 0.22]), \u03bc0 (e.g. [0.0, 0.35]) and \u03b8. Since the point estimates are already close, widening with the mid-points held near current values should preserve pooled fit while restoring realistic between-subject spread.

No mechanism-family change is warranted or permitted here \u2014 the prescribed compensatory position-bound WADD with faint-praise discounting is clearly the right family, and this is a calibration pass on top of it.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0557 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0484 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The accepted iter-2 candidate is a genuine improvement (0.0557 -> 0.0484) and it remains faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family: all-cue compensatory integration, validity-vs-position mixture gated by display readability, monotone faint-praise discount \\u03b8, direction-blind density dilution, no coherence/unanimity premium. It is still the only theory in the comparison set that simultaneously gets Exp 3 negative (-0.17 vs -0.208), Exp 4 moderate (0.684 vs 0.659) and Exp 6 negative (-0.143 vs -0.150) \\u2014 the three contrasts that individually killed pi_1, pi_2/pi_3 and pi_4. Between-subject variance also improved (0.008-0.040 vs the 0.006-0.009 of iter 1), now roughly in the observed range on Exps 4-6 though still low on Exps 1-3.\n\nHowever, the iter-2 calibration traded residuals rather than uniformly shrinking them. Wins: Exp 3 (+0.082 -> +0.037) and Exp 4 (+0.089 -> +0.025), driven by the \\u03bc0 reduction and the \\u03b2/\\u03bb flattening. Losses: Exp 2 (-0.010 -> +0.048), Exp 5 (-0.015 -> +0.030, sign now flipped positive) and Exp 1 (+0.034 -> +0.045). The Exp 2 regression is directly attributable to lowering \\u03bc1: the readability gate no longer saturates on that scrambled display, so a validity leak pushed the metric from a near-perfect 0.500 up to 0.558 (my own iter-1 'two-birds' suggestion overshot here). The Exp 5 sign flip is a \\u03b8 x dilution interaction: raising \\u03b8 while the sparse lo-cell (weak single endorsement vs empty) is strongly amplified by the 1/(c0+\\u03ba T) denominator drives that cell far sub-chance, while the dense hi-cell (5/5 vs 4/5) is compressed \\u2014 so hi-lo went positive when the data want it slightly negative. Exp 1 remains systematically ~0.045 too high, i.e. the model is globally a bit too deterministic on validity-sorted displays.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep PWA-DD exactly as is mechanically \\u2014 no family change, no new terms. This is a third calibration pass with three targeted, mostly-orthogonal knobs, chosen to undo the two costs my last critique incurred while preserving its two wins.\n\n1. UNDO the \\u03bc1 reduction (my iter-1 advice that backfired). Exp 2 was near-perfect at 0.500 when the readability gate saturated (\\u03bc\\u21921) and regressed to 0.558 once \\u03bc1 was lowered to 1.15. Restore \\u03bc1 to roughly [1.4, 2.2] (mid ~1.8) so Exp 2's scrambled display re-saturates and returns to ~0.51. Do NOT try to fix Exp 4 through the gate \\u2014 the \\u03b2/\\u03bb route already worked (0.748 -> 0.684) and should be kept.\n\n2. Reduce global determinacy slightly to fix Exp 1 (and mop up Exp 4/Exp 5). Raise the lapse box to about \\u03b5 \\u2208 [0.06, 0.26] (mid ~0.16) and/or shave the top of \\u03b2 to ~[2.0, 5.0]. This is a single lever that moves four residuals in the right direction at once: Exp 1 0.798 -> ~0.78, Exp 2 (post-fix) stays ~0.51 (it is at chance, so \\u03b5 is inert there), Exp 4 0.684 -> ~0.66, Exp 5 0.017 -> ~0.010. Its only cost is compressing Exp 3's contrast.\n\n3. Compensate Exp 3 with the lever that already worked, taken one small step further \\u2014 not with more \\u03b8. Lower \\u03bc0 to [0.0, 0.08] (mid ~0.04). \\u03bc0 is arithmetically inert wherever the gate saturates (Exps 2, 4, 6) and, in Exp 3's ASCENDING display, it is the residual leak that props up the lowest-validity cue sitting in column 0 \\u2014 exactly what blunts the agree-minus-conflict contrast. Hold \\u03b8 where it is (~[0.08, 0.16]); pushing \\u03b8 higher again is what flipped Exp 5 positive and inflated Exp 1, so that direction is now closed.\n\n4. One small extra knob for Exp 5's sign: shade the dilution gain down, \\u03ba \\u2208 [0.7, 1.6] (mid ~1.15). Less dilution differential between the sparse lo-cell and the dense hi-cell shrinks the artificial hi-lo gap and lets the observed slightly-negative value (-0.013) come back, without touching the direction-blindness of the mechanism or reintroducing any coherence bonus.\n\nGuardrails to check before submitting: (a) the [1,1,1,1,1] vs [0,0,0,0,0] dominance anchor must stay at ceiling under the upper end of the \\u03b8 box combined with the higher \\u03b5; (b) Exp 6 must not drift positive \\u2014 it is currently the best-fit experiment (-0.143 vs -0.150) and depends on strong column-0 positional dominance, so verify \\u03bb and the gate still saturate there; (c) keep the widened \\u03b2/\\u03b5/\\u03b8 boxes for between-subject spread, especially on Exps 1-3 where simulated variance (0.008) is still ~2-4x below observed (0.014-0.037)."
