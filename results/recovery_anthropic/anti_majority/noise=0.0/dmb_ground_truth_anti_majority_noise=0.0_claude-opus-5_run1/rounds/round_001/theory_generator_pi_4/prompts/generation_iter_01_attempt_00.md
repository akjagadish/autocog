# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Replace pi_3 with a compensatory theory that keeps its good fits on Exps 2-4 but drops the (falsified) positional re-sorting and adds relative-margin determinacy. Sketch:

**'Readability-limited validity weighting with relative-margin determinacy'.** (1) Integration is compensatory: p(A) = logistic(beta * D) with lapse epsilon, where the evidence uses subjective weights w_j proportional to logit(v_j)^gamma with gamma ~ 1.2-2.0 (steep enough that in a validity-sorted environment the top cue usually beats a coalition of 3-4 weak cues, reproducing Exp 3 ~0.75 and Exp 1's high conflict consistency).
(2) **Binding readability, not position.** Weights are flattened toward EQUAL weighting by an amount kappa that depends on how easily the stated validities can be bound to displayed columns: w_eff = (1-kappa)*w + kappa*(1/n). kappa should be a monotone function of the *incongruence/unreadability* of the display, e.g. kappa = k0 + k1*(1 - |Kendall tau(validity rank, column order)|) with an extra increment when the single most valid expert is not in an extreme (first/last) column. Crucially kappa is SMALL for any monotone display, ascending or descending (Exp 1 tau=-1 and Exp 3 tau=+1 both readable -> validity weights preserved, which is exactly where pi_3 died), and LARGE for scrambled displays (Exp 2 -> kappa near 1 gives tallying: A/B ties at 0.5, F at ~0.9, metric ~0.65 vs observed 0.659; Exp 4 -> kappa ~0.4 gives ~0.48 vs observed 0.510). This makes the theory environmentally falsifiable in a direction-free way: it predicts that REVERSING a sorted display costs nothing, while permuting it costs a lot - the opposite of pi_3.
(3) **Relative-margin determinacy.** The logistic argument is the weighted difference normalised by the total endorsement mass in the pair: D = sum_j w_eff_j (x_Aj - x_Bj) / (c + sum_j w_eff_j (x_Aj + x_Bj)), with c a small constant. This yields near-indifference when both options carry almost no endorsements (Exp 1 families G/H: [00001] vs [00000] and [10000] vs [00000] -> ~chance) while conflict families with two endorsed options stay decisive, which is the only way to get Exp 1's metric NEGATIVE (agreement < conflict, observed -0.208) - something both current theories get wrong in sign or magnitude.
(4) Population structure: heterogeneous beta and mild gamma variation (no discrete strategy switching), so between-subject variance is largest in intermediate-margin/scrambled environments (matching the observed var ~0.037 in Exps 1-2 vs ~0.01-0.02 in Exps 3-4).

Parameter ranges should be set so the model reproduces, without per-experiment refitting: Exp 1 metric in [-0.30, -0.05], Exp 2 in [0.55, 0.75], Exp 3 in [0.70, 0.82], Exp 4 in [0.45, 0.60]. Future discriminating experiments: same validities presented sorted-ascending vs sorted-descending vs scrambled (readability theory predicts ascending = descending >> scrambled; pi_3 predicted ascending << descending), and single-endorsement-vs-zero-endorsement trials versus many-endorsement trials with the same absolute weighted margin (relative-margin determinacy predicts a large accuracy drop in the former; TTB predicts none).

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.258)

**Description**
**WADD-γ with Positional Validity Misattribution (WADD-γ + position-default blending), with heterogeneous decision determinacy.**

People integrate cues compensatorily: each expert's subjective importance is a power transform of that expert's diagnosticity on the log-odds scale, L_j = log(v_j/(1−v_j)), w_j ∝ L_j^γ; the decision rests on the normalised evidence margin d = Σ_j w_j (x_Aj − x_Bj), with p(A) logistic in β·d and an attentional lapse ε. γ ≈ 1.15–1.85 places the decision maker in the near-lexicographic but still compensatory regime: the top expert usually survives a coalition of dissenters, but a near-peer second cue plus a couple of moderate cues can cancel or overturn it.

The substantive claim about *where the weights get attached* is retained and is the theory's main falsifiable commitment. Validities are stated verbally in the instructions, but the decision maker must bind each stated validity to a *column* of the displayed rating vector. This binding is costly and error-prone, and people fall back on a powerful display heuristic: **importance decreases from left to right** (the first-listed expert is the best one, the last-listed the worst). Subjective weights are therefore a blend, with mixing weight λ, of the correctly-bound validity weights and the weights implied by the positional default (the same weight multiset re-sorted into descending order across columns):

  w_eff ∝ (1−λ)·L_j^γ + λ·sort_desc(L^γ)_j.

This is an *environmental* prediction, not a per-experiment fudge: conflict-trial accuracy is a property of the alignment between display order and validity order, while the integration rule itself stays a single stationary compensatory WADD-γ. Concretely, (i) scramble the column order of an environment whose cues are currently presented in descending validity and conflict accuracy must fall toward (and, on some families, below) chance; (ii) re-sort the columns of a scrambled environment into descending validity and the same subjects must become sharply more accurate and more top-cue-consistent; (iii) an explicit column-labelling manipulation that makes the validity→column binding visually trivial should abolish the drop. Because the blend is the exact identity whenever columns are already validity-ordered, λ is behaviourally inert in validity-sorted environments and can only be identified by comparing environments — precisely the invariance signature the theory stakes itself on.

The third claim is about **population structure**: the same stationary rule is held by everyone, but decision determinacy is heterogeneous across people. Some subjects convert modest weighted margins into near-deterministic choices, others remain near chance on all but the most lopsided evidence. That heterogeneity is carried by the logistic gain β and by mild variation in the validity-sensitivity exponent γ, not by discrete strategy switching; the theory therefore predicts that between-subject spread in conflict accuracy should be largest in environments with intermediate margins and should shrink towards zero in environments where every conflict family is near-cancelling.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.021)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0503 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0503 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
**Readability-limited validity weighting with dissent aversion and endorsement discount (RVW-DE).**

The theory holds that a single stationary, fully compensatory integration rule underlies choice in all cue-based binary-feature environments, and that the apparent switching between 'take-the-best-like' and 'tallying-like' behaviour across experiments is produced by three modulators that are properties of the *display and the evidence pattern*, not of the strategy.

(1) **Graded validity weighting.** Each expert's subjective importance is a power transform of that expert's diagnosticity on the log-odds scale, w_j ∝ logit(v_j)^gamma, with gamma ≈ 1.4–2.1. This is steep enough that a clearly best expert normally survives a coalition of three or four weak experts (near-lexicographic behaviour), yet weak enough that a near-peer plus a couple of moderate cues can overturn the top cue.

(2) **Binding readability, not position.** Stated validities must be bound to displayed columns. When the display order is *monotone* in validity (ascending OR descending), this binding is trivial and the validity weights are used essentially intact. When the order is scrambled, binding fails partially and the weights are flattened toward EQUAL weighting: w_eff = (1-kappa)·w + kappa/n, with kappa a monotone function of display incongruence, kappa = k0 + k1·(1-|Kendall tau(column index, validity)|) + k2·[best expert is not in an extreme column]. This is direction-free: reversing a sorted display costs nothing, permuting it costs a lot (the opposite of positional-misattribution accounts, which are falsified by ascending-validity environments where people still track validity). Superimposed on this is a *mild* left-to-right attention gradient phi (~15%) that scales, but never re-sorts, the effective weights — a reading-order effect, not a validity misattribution.

(3) **Dissent aversion (consensus premium).** Options are not evaluated only by weighted evidence: an option about which the experts are *unanimous* is perceived as a known quantity, whereas conflicting testimony makes the option's quality ambiguous. Subjects add a direction-blind premium rho·c(x) for consensus, where c(x) = (2·mean(x)-1)^4 is a steeply convex function of the endorsement proportion, so that only near-unanimity matters. This makes the sharp, falsifiable prediction that a product unanimously rated 0 by all experts can be *preferred* to a product carrying a single weak endorsement — i.e. accuracy on 'one-endorsement vs zero-endorsement' pairs can drop below chance while accuracy on genuine conflict pairs (two endorsed options) stays high. It leaves dominance pairs (all-1 vs all-0, both unanimous) untouched.

(4) **Endorsement discount.** Each positive endorsement carries a small fixed credibility cost theta (faint-praise skepticism / discounting of easily-obtained endorsements), so an option with more endorsements is penalised slightly per endorsement. This is a small anti-tallying component that leaves equal-count pairs untouched.

(5) **Population structure.** Everyone holds the same rule; heterogeneity lives in decision determinacy beta, in gamma, and in the modulator magnitudes — no discrete strategy switching. Between-subject spread is therefore largest in environments whose decisive families sit at intermediate margins (scrambled displays, and difference-of-proportions metrics) and smallest where every scored family is lopsided.

`rationale`: I adopt the arbiter's core prescription (compensatory validity weighting with gamma-steepened log-odds weights, plus readability-driven flattening toward equal weights that is direction-free) but replace its third ingredient, because I checked it analytically and it cannot work. Relative-margin normalisation D = num/(c+mass) assigns virtually the SAME |D| to the pair [00001]-vs-[00000] (num=mass=w_top) and to the conflict pair [10000]-vs-[00001] (num≈mass≈w_top), so it cannot make the former near-chance while the latter stays at ~0.95 — it just rescales everything. Yet that dissociation is exactly what the negative agreement-minus-conflict metric demands (with dominance at ~1, the single-endorsement-vs-nothing families must fall BELOW chance for the difference to reach -0.21). The only mechanism class that can invert those families while leaving two-endorsement conflict families and dominance intact is a within-option, direction-blind pattern term. I therefore add (i) a steeply convex CONSENSUS PREMIUM rho·(2·mean-1)^4 — unanimous testimony is preferred as unambiguous, and because the function is quartic it is inert for all mixed profiles (so it does not perturb any other experiment's scored trials: none of them contain a unanimous option in a scored pair except the dominance pair, where it cancels) — and (ii) a small per-endorsement credibility discount theta, which is inert whenever the two options carry equal endorsement counts, and which uniformly nudges behaviour toward the frugal winner in exactly those conflict families where the validity-favoured option carries fewer endorsements.

I kept the arbiter's readability mechanism, which is the part that made pi_3 fit two environments, but stated it in a falsifiable direction-free form (kappa grows with 1-|Kendall tau| plus an increment when the best expert sits in a non-extreme column), so monotone-ascending and monotone-descending displays are equally readable (this is what killed pi_3, which predicted ascending displays should collapse) while scrambled displays flatten toward tallying. Instead of pi_3's falsified re-sorting of the weight multiset, positional effects enter only as a mild multiplicative reading-order gradient (~15%) that never reorders the effective weights; this is enough to break the exact ties that a pure equal-weight account leaves at 0.5 in the scrambled 6-cue environment (raising its metric from ~0.58 toward the observed ~0.66) and to sharpen top-cue reliance in the descending-order environment, without disturbing the strongly negative difference metric in the ascending environment.

Hand-computing the four scored metrics family-by-family with mid-range parameters gives: descending-order 5-cue conflict consistency ≈ 0.69-0.83 (observed 0.753), scrambled 6-cue tally-vs-TTB accuracy ≈ 0.46-0.60 (observed 0.510), ascending-order agreement-minus-conflict ≈ -0.19 to -0.25 (observed -0.208), scrambled 6-cue positional metric ≈ 0.57-0.66 (observed 0.659). No previous theory got the sign of the third metric right at all (pi_3: +0.62, pi_2: +0.45, pi_1: -0.01) while also staying near the other three, so this should dominate the leaderboard. Heterogeneity in beta plus the modulators generates the observed pattern of between-subject variance (largest for the difference metric and the scrambled positional metric, smallest for the tally-conflict metric).

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a strong first pass and clearly the best-fitting theory so far: it is the only one that recovers the SIGN and near-exact magnitude of the Exp 3 agreement-minus-conflict metric (-0.209 vs -0.208 observed) while simultaneously landing Exp 4's scrambled positional metric almost dead on (0.655 vs 0.659). The dissent-aversion / consensus-premium term is doing exactly the work the arbiter's relative-margin term was supposed to do (near-chance or sub-chance on the single-endorsement-vs-nothing families G/H while dominance stays at ~1 and two-endorsement conflict families stay decisive), and the direction-free readability flattening keeps the good Exp 2 and Exp 4 behaviour without reintroducing pi_3's falsified positional re-sorting. So the substitution in ingredient (3) is justified and faithful to the spirit of the prescribed family (compensatory weighted-additive with readability-driven flattening); it is not a family switch.

Two residual mismatches remain, both systematic and both in the same direction. (i) The model is too deterministic in the validity-weighted direction in the monotone-descending 5-cue environment: Exp 1 conflict consistency is 0.835 vs 0.753 observed (+0.081, the single largest point-estimate error), and Exp 2 is likewise slightly high (0.550 vs 0.510). Both errors are consistent with gamma and/or beta sitting a notch too high, i.e. the top cue beats weak coalitions a bit too reliably. (ii) Between-subject variance is uniformly under-produced by roughly a factor of 2-5: Exp 1 0.011 vs 0.023, Exp 2 0.005 vs 0.014, Exp 3 0.008 vs 0.037, Exp 4 0.014 vs 0.038. The population structure claimed in point (5) of the theory is therefore not actually being realised at the sampled parameter breadth \u2014 the parameter boxes are too narrow, so simulated subjects behave nearly identically. Since var is scored alongside the point estimate, this is the largest remaining source of loss and it is present in all four experiments, not just one.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED and should be the base; I am asking only for small in-family recalibration, not a redesign. Keep the exact predict() structure (gamma-steepened logit weights, direction-free kappa flattening from 1-|tau| plus the off-extreme increment, mild non-reordering phi gradient, quartic consensus premium rho, endorsement discount theta, logistic + lapse). Two targeted knobs: (1) Shave the top-cue determinacy slightly \u2014 lower the gamma box from [1.35, 2.10] to roughly [1.15, 1.85] and shift the beta box down modestly (e.g. [2.5, 13]) so that Exp 1 conflict consistency falls from 0.835 toward ~0.76 and Exp 2 from 0.55 toward ~0.52. Verify while doing so that Exp 3 stays in [-0.25, -0.15] and Exp 4 in [0.60, 0.70]; if the extra noise starts pulling Exp 3 toward 0, compensate by nudging rho up within its existing box rather than by raising beta again. (2) Fix the under-dispersion: the between-subject variance is 2-5x too small in every experiment, so widen the per-subject sampling breadth of the heterogeneity-carrying parameters (beta especially, plus gamma, rho and eps) so that individual subjects genuinely differ in how near-lexicographic they are \u2014 a wide beta box (some subjects near beta~2, some near beta~14) will raise var in Exp 1/3/4 toward the observed 0.02-0.04 without moving the pooled means much, because the metric is close to linear in p over the relevant range. Do NOT introduce discrete strategy mixtures to buy variance; that would drift out of the prescribed single-rule compensatory family. This is the first iteration, so no prior advice conflicts; if the widened-beta / lower-gamma step is rejected by the gate, the next attempt should keep the widened heterogeneity but restore gamma nearer its current midpoint.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0503 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "rationale": "Minimal-diff edit: `predict` and `policy` are re-emitted VERBATIM; only the parameter boxes (and the matching in-code fallback defaults, which are never used when parameters are supplied) change. This directly implements the critic's two targeted knobs on the accepted base.\n\n(1) **Shave top-cue determinacy.** gamma [1.35, 2.10] -> [1.10, 1.95] and beta [3.0, 16.0] -> [1.2, 13.0] (mean beta 9.5 -> 7.1). Hand-computing Exp 1's four conflict families with the weight vector the model builds for a descending 5-cue display (w_eff \u2248 [.539,.291,.104,.047,.019] after the phi gradient) gives evidence margins D \u2248 {0.167, 0.122, 0.69, 0.146}; averaging logistic(beta*D) over beta ~ U[1.2,13] (logistic is concave in beta for D>0, so widening downward lowers the mean) yields family mean \u2248 0.78, and with lapse eps ~ U[0,0.16] (mean .08) the pooled conflict consistency lands \u2248 0.76 vs 0.835 previously and 0.753 observed \u2014 removing the single largest point-estimate error. The same shift pulls Exp 2 from 0.550 toward ~0.52 (observed 0.510) and Exp 4 slightly toward 0.5, which the widened phi box (see below) offsets.\n\n(2) **Protect Exp 3's negative sign while adding noise.** Extra lapse/noise compresses agreement-minus-conflict toward 0, so, exactly as the critic prescribed, I compensate by nudging rho UP rather than raising beta: rho [0.18, 0.36] -> [0.18, 0.46] (mean .27 -> .32). With rho=0.32 the ascending-display families give D_G \u2248 +0.14, D_H \u2248 -0.28 (single-endorsement pairs sit at/below chance) while conflict families A/B/E/F keep |D| = 0.10-0.68, so the raw difference is \u2248 -0.225 and, after the mean lapse factor 0.92, \u2248 -0.21 (observed -0.208). Dominance and all mixed-profile pairs are untouched because c(x) is quartic.\n\n(3) **Fix the 2-5x under-dispersion.** Heterogeneity is carried entirely by widening continuous boxes \u2014 no discrete strategy mixture. beta now spans near-chance subjects (beta~1.5 -> Exp 1 metric ~0.57) to near-deterministic ones (beta~13 -> ~0.87); theta [0.015,.05] -> [0.0, 0.07] matters a lot in Exp 1 (it enters conflict margins as +3theta, i.e. 0 to 0.21 of extra evidence for the frugal winner) and rho/phi/kappa breadth adds spread in the scrambled environments. phi [0.08,0.22] -> [0.05,0.28] and the wider k0/k1/k2 boxes generate the between-subject spread in the two scrambled-display metrics (Exps 2 and 4) that the previous narrow boxes suppressed, while leaving the pooled means near their (already excellent) values because phi's mean is essentially unchanged."
