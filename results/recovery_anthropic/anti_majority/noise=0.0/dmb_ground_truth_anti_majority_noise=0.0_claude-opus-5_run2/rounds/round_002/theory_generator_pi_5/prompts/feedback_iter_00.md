# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Replace PWEA (pi_3) with a NEW theory: 'Noisy Numerosity Comparison of Warning Flags (Weber Counting, WC)'.

Core claims:
1. Negative polarity and validity-blindness are retained (as in FC-LEX, and as forced by Exps 2-6): the subject forms the raw number of 1s for each option; the option with the smaller perceived count is chosen. Which experts carry the flags does not enter the comparison.
2. The counts are represented with scalar-variability / Weber noise, so discriminability depends on the RATIO (or scaled difference) of the two counts, not on the raw difference and not on a flat plateau. Concretely: p(choose fewer-flag option) = (1-eps)*Phi( (c_more - c_less) / (w * sqrt(c_more^2 + c_less^2 + c0)) ) + eps/2, with a subject-level Weber fraction w and a small additive constant c0 so that 0-vs-1 remains easy. This yields: 0-vs-1, 0-vs-5, 1-vs-4, 2-vs-4 easy (~0.8-0.9, matching Exps 3-6), but 2-vs-3 hard (~0.5-0.6, matching Exp 1's observed 0.517), which no parameterisation of FC-LEX can produce and which PWEA only reproduces by an overshoot to 0.24.
3. Exact count ties are undecidable by the counting mechanism and are resolved by a subject-level, cue-INDEPENDENT idiosyncratic bias (side/order/first-cue habit) that is the same across all equal-count pairs. This predicts exactly the ~0 Exp-2 metric (observed 0.067) that killed PWEA, while remaining agnostic about the absolute tie-choice level.
4. Optional heterogeneity term to capture Exp 1's bimodal between-subject variance (var=0.133): a subject-level probability that near-chance experts (validity below a subject cutoff, e.g. < ~0.6) are discarded before counting, so a minority of subjects reverse on 2-high-flag vs 3-low-flag pairs. Keep this fraction modest so it does not induce a large Exp-2 P1/P2 asymmetry, and make the filter discrete (all-or-none per expert), NOT graded weighting \u2014 gradedness is what Exp 2 rules out.

Parameter ranges should be chosen so that the model reproduces, in simulation: Exp1 metric ~0.5 with high between-subject spread; Exp2 metric ~0.0-0.1; Exp3 ~0.75-0.80; Exp4 ~ -0.63; Exp5 ~ -0.58; Exp6 ~ +0.66.

This new theory is a sharp competitor to FC-LEX: they agree on polarity and validity-blindness but disagree on magnitude invariance. Future experiments should therefore contrast count-ratio ladders holding the count difference fixed (0-vs-1, 1-vs-2, 2-vs-3, 3-vs-4) against difference ladders (0-vs-1, 0-vs-2, 0-vs-4), where FC-LEX predicts one flat plateau and WC predicts a monotone ratio-driven gradient.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
**Weber Counting with Severity Tiebreak and Expert Triage (WC-ST).**

A binary expert rating of '1' is read as a *warning flag*, not an endorsement, so an option's badness grows with the number of 1s it carries and the subject picks the option that seems to carry FEWER flags. Three mechanistic claims, plus one heterogeneity claim:

1. **Negative polarity, validity-blind numerosity.** The decision variable is the raw *count* of flags per option, not a validity-weighted mass. Which experts contributed the flags is irrelevant to the count; the stated validities are acknowledged but never converted into cue weights. This is what makes the model look anti-TTB on dominance/agreement pairs and pro-TTB on conflict pairs, with a single mechanism.

2. **Scalar variability (Weber noise) on the counts.** Perceived numerosity is noisy with noise that scales with magnitude, so discriminability depends on the RATIO-scaled difference, not the raw difference:  s = (c_hi - c_lo) / sqrt(c_hi^2 + c_lo^2 + 1). The small additive constant 1 keeps 0-vs-1 easy. Crucially, the psychometric function over s is *threshold-like* (Weibull with slope exponent kappa > 1), i.e. accelerating near zero: comparisons whose count ratio falls below the subject's Weber threshold theta stay essentially at chance, while comparisons above it jump quickly to a lapse-limited ceiling. This is what produces near-chance 2-vs-3 (~0.53) at the same time as high 1-vs-2 (~0.73), 2-vs-4 (~0.78) and near-ceiling 0-vs-1 / 1-vs-4 / 0-vs-5 (~0.85) — a pattern that neither a flat sign-only rule (FC-LEX) nor a linear/Gaussian margin rule can generate.

3. **Severity tiebreak on exact count ties.** When the two options carry exactly the same number of flags the counting mechanism is silent. The subject then asks which single flag is *worst*: the most reliable expert that discriminates decides, and the option carrying THAT expert's flag is (usually) rejected. The strength/direction of this fallback is a subject-level bias tie_bias = P(choose the option flagged by the top discriminating expert), sitting below 0.5 (mildly repelled). Because this rule keys on the top discriminating expert in exactly the same way for every equal-count pair, it predicts *no* differential across equal-count pairs that share the same top discriminating expert.

4. **Discrete expert triage (minority).** A minority of subjects do not count everyone: they apply an all-or-none trust filter, ignoring the one or two least-valid experts entirely before counting (never a graded weighting — gradedness is ruled out by the equal-count data). Triage subjects therefore *reverse* on pairs whose flag surplus lives entirely on the discarded experts (e.g. 2 high-validity flags vs 3 low-validity flags), which injects genuine bimodal between-subject dispersion exactly where the human data show it, and creates the small positive asymmetry among equal-count pairs whose tie is broken by triage.

WC-ST is a sharp competitor to sign-only flag counting: they agree on polarity and validity-blindness but disagree about magnitude invariance. WC-ST predicts a monotone *ratio-driven* accuracy gradient (0v1 > 1v2 > 2v3 > 3v4 at constant difference; 0v1 < 0v2 < 0v4 at constant smaller count), whereas the sign-only rule predicts one flat plateau.

`rationale`:
The running-best theory (FC-LEX) nailed five metrics but failed badly on the 2-vs-3 count comparison (predicted 0.837, observed 0.517) because its accuracy is magnitude-blind: every unequal-count pair gets the same flat h. The graded-weight alternative (PWEA) fixed that cell only by over-rotating into validity-weighted evidence, which then produced a large spurious asymmetry between equal-count pairs (Exp 6: +0.54 vs observed 0.067). WC-ST resolves the dilemma with the arbiter's prescribed Weber-counting family plus two specific refinements that the arithmetic of the data demands.

(i) *Threshold-shaped (Weibull), not Gaussian, psychometric function.* I checked analytically that a plain Phi() over the ratio-scaled count difference cannot simultaneously give acc(2,3)~0.52 and acc(1,2)~0.73: those two comparisons differ by only a factor 1.5 in s, so any near-linear link forces them together, collapsing Exp 1 to chance. An accelerating Weibull with kappa~6 expands that factor into a threshold non-linearity: s=0.267 (2v3) sits below threshold and stays near chance, while s>=0.41 (1v2, 2v4) is well above it and s>=0.6 (0v1, 1v4, 1v5, 0v5) is lapse-limited at ceiling. This single change is what makes the whole set of six metrics simultaneously reachable.

(ii) *Severity (top-expert) tiebreak rather than a pure side bias.* Both Exp-6 target pairs are exact count ties whose top discriminating expert is feature 0, so the same tiebreak applies to both and the Exp-6 contrast comes out at ~0 — the cue-independence the arbiter demanded is achieved behaviourally without giving up the low tie-hit rate (~0.25) that Exp 3 needs for its rev cell (a coin-flip tiebreak would cost Exp 3 about 0.04).

(iii) *Discrete expert triage in a small minority (~16% of subjects).* This is the arbiter's point-4 heterogeneity, implemented as an all-or-none discard of the one or two least-valid experts (never graded weighting, which Exp 2/Exp 6 rule out). Triage subjects reverse on Exp 5's [1,1,0,0,0] vs [0,0,1,1,1] pair (the flag surplus lives entirely on the discarded 0.56/0.52 experts), pushing Exp 5 down to ~0.50 and injecting the bimodal between-subject dispersion the data show (var=0.133), while also generating the small positive Exp-6 asymmetry (~+0.09 vs observed +0.067) and sharpening Exp 3 toward -0.55.

Hand-computation over the six designs at the centre of the declared ranges gives: Exp1 ~0.76, Exp2 ~-0.62, Exp3 ~-0.55, Exp4 ~0.69, Exp5 ~0.50, Exp6 ~0.09, against observed 0.774 / -0.634 / -0.577 / 0.660 / 0.517 / 0.067 — every cell within ~0.05, versus FC-LEX's 0.32 miss on Exp 5. The theory is also experiment-invariant by construction: nothing keys on a specific design, only on flag counts, count ratios, and validity rank order, so it makes crisp falsifiable predictions for the ratio-vs-difference ladders the arbiter proposed.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0308 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0308.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

{
  "interpretation": "The candidate (WC-ST) matches all six pooled point estimates to within ~0.08, and within ~0.04 on five of six: Exp1 0.778 vs 0.774; Exp2 -0.614 vs -0.634; Exp3 -0.503 vs -0.577; Exp4 0.690 vs 0.660; Exp5 0.503 vs 0.517; Exp6 0.102 vs 0.067. Critically, it is the only candidate on the board that simultaneously reproduces (a) the anti-TTB/negative-polarity signature on dominance and agreement pairs (Exps 2-4), which pi_1/pi_2 miss entirely, (b) the near-chance 2-vs-3 outcome in Exp5 (0.50 vs 0.52), which the sign-only flag-counting rule pi_4/pi_1 badly overshoot at ~0.84-0.85 and which pi_3 undershoots at 0.24, and (c) the ~0 differential between equal-count pairs in Exp6 (0.10 vs 0.07), which pi_3 blows up to +0.54. So the two mechanisms the arbiter demanded \\u2014 magnitude/ratio-dependent discriminability of the flag counts, and a cue-independent tiebreak on exact count ties \\u2014 are each doing exactly the work they were hypothesised to do, and the model is faithful to the prescribed Weber-counting family (the Weibull link is an in-family link-function choice, not a family switch; the triage filter is discrete/all-or-none as required). The one clear residual is under-dispersion of between-subject variance: candidate var is 0.006 vs 0.026 (Exp1), 0.018 vs 0.071 (Exp3), and 0.034 vs 0.133 (Exp5). Human subjects are considerably more bimodal on exactly the 2-high-flag-vs-3-low-flag cell than the ~16% triage rate produces, and the per-subject theta/kappa/epsilon draws are too homogeneous. Exp3's magnitude is also slightly compressed (-0.50 vs -0.58). These are calibration-level, not structural, shortfalls: the mean structure across all six designs is captured by one design-independent mechanism (flag count, count ratio, validity rank order), which is the experiment-invariance the loop is after.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED at loss=0.0308 and is the first proposal to reconcile all six metrics with a single design-independent mechanism: negative-polarity validity-blind counting explains Exps 2-4 and the Exp1 TTB-looking hit rate, ratio-scaled (Weber) discriminability explains why 2-vs-3 sits at chance while 0-vs-1/1-vs-4/0-vs-5 sit near ceiling, and the top-expert severity tiebreak delivers the ~0 Exp6 equal-count differential that killed pi_3. No competing theory is within 0.3 of the data on Exp5 and Exp6 simultaneously. The only remaining miscalibration is between-subject dispersion (simulated var roughly 1/4 of observed on Exps 1, 3, 5) plus a mild compression of Exp3; if the loop is run further, the right in-family knobs are to raise the triage-subject fraction modestly (ignore_prone cutoff from ~0.84 toward ~0.72, i.e. ~25-30% of subjects dropping the <0.65-validity experts) and to widen the subject-level theta/kappa/tie_bias ranges so that per-subject accuracy on the 2-vs-3 cell splits into a reversing and a non-reversing mode, rather than everyone hovering at 0.50. That is a variance-matching tune, not a redesign, so the current theory should be kept as the base."
