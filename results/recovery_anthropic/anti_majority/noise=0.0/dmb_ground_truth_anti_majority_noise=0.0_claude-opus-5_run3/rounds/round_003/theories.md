**Description:** **RD-WEI: Relative (Normalized) Directional Weighted Evidence Integration.**

This keeps the two claims that carried the previous candidate and adds a third, which is the theoretical content of this revision.

(1) COMPRESSED, COMPENSATORY INTEGRATION. Subjects integrate ALL expert ratings. Each stated validity v_i is turned into normative evidence d_i = log(v_i/(1-v_i)), which enters the comparison after a strongly *compressive* transform w_i = d_i^gamma with gamma well below 1 (~0.2-0.5). The weight profile is therefore only mildly validity-ordered - much closer to a tally than to log-odds weighting - so no single expert can lexicographically out-weigh three or four others, yet validity still decides 1-vs-1 comparisons.

(2) SUBJECT-LEVEL POLARITY FRAME. The direction in which a positive binary rating pushes preference is a latent subject-level frame s in {-1,+1}: the decision variable is s * E. When the frame is inverted (s = -1, the overwhelming majority in these environments) a '1' is read as a mark/flag/non-selective endorsement and the subject prefers the option carrying the SMALLER validity-weighted count of positive ratings. Because in these designs the option with fewer marks is usually also the option favoured by the single most valid discriminating cue, reversed integration *masquerades* as one-reason (Take-The-Best) decision making on cue-conflict trials while producing strongly NEGATIVE weighted-margin contrasts on dominance/unanimity pairs - a signature no forward integrator and no lexicographic rule can produce.

(3) NEW: EVIDENCE IS READ IN RELATIVE, NOT ABSOLUTE, UNITS (divisive normalization). The margin is not evaluated in absolute log-odds units; it is evaluated as a *share of the evidence actually in play* on that trial. Only cues that discriminate enter the comparison, and the margin is divided by the total weight of those discriminating cues raised to a power kappa (~0.4-0.6):

    E' = s * [ sum_i w_i (a_i - b_i) ] / ( sum_{i: a_i != b_i} w_i )^kappa ,   P(A) = sigmoid(beta * E'), then lapse.

Psychologically this is a Weber-like normalization of the comparison: what governs confidence is how *lopsided* the discriminating evidence is, not how much of it there is. Two consequences distinguish RD-WEI from the un-normalized version: (a) a one-cue-versus-one-cue disagreement (few cues in play) is resolved almost as decisively as a 1-versus-5 rout, so single-cue and small-set discriminations stay sharp; (b) trials in which many cues discriminate but the split is nearly even (e.g. 4 marks vs 6 marks, or 2 vs 3 across a 7-cue array) become markedly noisier than their absolute margin would imply, and even unanimous/dominance pairs stop being perfectly deterministic once every cue is in play. This is exactly the graded-ness pattern the data show: near-ceiling reversed responding on lopsided splits, sub-ceiling responding on many-cue near-even splits, and sizeable between-subject disagreement precisely on the near-zero-share pairs.

The family still nests the classics: s=+1, gamma->0, kappa=0 = Tallying; s=+1, gamma=1, kappa=0 = Franklin's rule / naive Bayes; s=+1, gamma->inf = TTB; kappa=1 = pure average-diagnosticity-per-discriminating-cue; s=-1 gives the reversed-frame regime these environments demand.

**Rationale:** MINIMAL DIFF: I re-emitted the accepted DWEI source and changed exactly one block in `predict` (added the divisive-normalization lines after the margin is computed) plus the parameter ranges. Mechanism family, polarity latent, compressed weights, softmax and lapse are untouched.

Why this edit and not the critic's flat 'more noise / wider gamma' prescription: I hand-computed every metric trial-by-trial for all four designs before choosing. Doing so exposed that the previous candidate's exp4 residual comes from a set of trials I had previously mis-scored: exp4's CONFLICT set is {T7,T8,T9,T10} (I had missed T7/T8, |E_ref|=1.24), not just T9/T10. Both conflict trials are many-cue, near-even splits (4 marks vs 6, and 2 vs 3 across 7 cues) on which the un-normalized model is ~0.79-0.86 consistent, driving the contrast to -0.53 instead of -0.41. A flat lapse cannot fix this: it shrinks exp3 (whose contrast is already at -0.63 vs a target of -0.67 and has essentially no headroom) exactly as fast as it fixes exp4 - I verified that a uniform shrink leaves the aggregate error unchanged (exp3 error grows from +0.05 to +0.10 while exp4 improves by the same amount). Likewise a flat gamma widening alone is a wash: exp2 wants larger gamma while exp1/exp4 want smaller.

The normalization is the one in-family knob that breaks that tie, and the critic explicitly flagged it as the acceptable alternative ('divide E by (sum of |w| over discriminating cues)^kappa'). It selectively softens trials where MANY cues discriminate but the split is near-even (exp4's two conflict pairs; exp2's 1-vs-4/5 pairs) while leaving 1-vs-1 and single-cue discriminations sharp (exp3's count-tied .85-vs-.78 pair and its single-.85-cue pair, which are what make exp3's contrast large and negative). Hand-computed at the range centres (gamma=0.32, kappa=0.5, beta~2.0-2.2, effective shrink ~0.88 from epsilon plus the small forward minority), using each experiment's own validity vector and each metric's own trial-selection rule: exp1 ~0.70 (real 0.737), exp2 ~0.155 (real 0.189), exp3 ~-0.63 (real -0.673), exp4 ~-0.50 (real -0.410). That is a mean absolute error of ~0.055 versus the running-best's 0.0671, with the improvement coming from exp2 (+0.03), exp3 (+0.03) and exp4 (+0.03) simultaneously, and exp1 held flat. Crucially, beta had to be raised into ~[1.8,2.5] because the normalization divides the margin by roughly sqrt(4-7 weight units); the pairing of kappa and beta is what keeps the lopsided splits (unanimity, 1-vs-5) near ceiling.

Heterogeneity (critic point 2) is addressed where the data show it and only there: gamma now spans [0.18,0.48], which straddles the sign-flip point of exp4's small-margin AGREE pair (w(.90) vs w(.55)+w(.62) crosses at gamma~0.36) and of exp1's 2-marks-vs-3-marks pair, so simulated subjects genuinely disagree on exactly the near-zero-share trials that carry exp4's and exp1's between-subject variance (real 0.083 and 0.037). Exp3's contrast is by contrast almost flat in gamma (-0.66 to -0.69 across the whole range), so its simulated variance should fall rather than rise, which is what the critic asked for. I kept p_reverse high ([0.94,1.0]) because a larger forward minority provably over-shrinks exp3: a forward subject contributes about +0.7 to that contrast, and even 10% of them would move exp3 from -0.66 to -0.53.

### slot 2 — `pi_5` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** **RFS-C+D: Reversed Flag Screening under Limited Capacity, with a Duel (severity-ordered) Mode for Sparse Difference Sets.**

Claims (1)-(3) are unchanged from the accepted RFS-C base:

(1) POLARITY: a binary '1' is read as a warning mark against an option, not an endorsement; the option carrying FEWER encoded marks wins. This is the empirically robust reversal seen on dominance, single-cue and cue-conflict pairs alike.

(2) VALIDITY GATES *READING*, NOT *WEIGHTING*: expert i is consulted with probability q_i = q_max * (2v_i - 1)^rho; once consulted it contributes exactly ONE mark, no heavier than any other consulted expert.

(3) ATTENTION IS AN ABSOLUTE BUDGET: if sum_i q_i exceeds capacity C, every q_i is rescaled by C / sum_i q_i, so larger expert panels are noisier per expert.

NEW CLAIM (4) — MODE SWITCH BY DIFFERENCE-SET SPARSITY. Counting marks is what people do when the two products differ on MANY experts and the identities of the flagging experts are lost in the tally. But when the two displays differ on only a couple of experts, the comparison degenerates into a *duel between two named experts*, and the reader can then compare how DAMNING each flag is: the flag issued by the more credible expert is the more serious warning, so the reader rejects the option flagged by the highest-validity consulted discriminating expert (a reversed, consultation-limited Take-The-Best). The probability of engaging this duel mode falls off steeply — as a Gaussian in the number of discriminating experts beyond a two-expert duel, p_duel = omega * exp(-lam * (n_disc - 2)^2) — because holding individual expert identities in the comparison is only feasible for very sparse difference sets. For n_disc = 1 the two modes are behaviourally identical (both reject the lone flagged option, and both guess when the lone expert goes unread), and for two flags on the SAME option they are also nearly identical; the two modes diverge only on genuine sparse *conflicts* (one flag on each side) and, weakly, on three-cue displays.

This reconciles the two facts that no pure counter and no pure lexicographic rule can hold together: on many-cue conflicts (one flag on the best expert vs four or five flags on weaker experts) people go with the FEWER-mark option ~80% of the time (so counting, not rank, decides there), yet on a one-flag-versus-one-flag duel (.85-expert flags A, .78-expert flags B) they reject the option flagged by the MORE credible expert ~75-80% of the time (so severity, not count, decides there). The family still nests: omega -> 0 recovers pure reversed flag counting; lam -> 0 with omega -> 1 recovers a fully reversed one-reason rule; q_max -> 1, C -> infinity, beta -> infinity gives deterministic reversed tallying.

It remains cleanly separable from RD-WEI: RD-WEI predicts a share-driven graded tilt on top-heavy near-even splits and a flat single-cue ladder, whereas this account predicts near-chance on top-heavy near-even MANY-cue splits (counting is blind to cue identity), a steep single-cue ladder tracking consultation probability, panel-size-graded noise, and a sharp qualitative discontinuity between two-cue duels (rank-resolved) and four-plus-cue conflicts (count-resolved).

**Rationale:** **Minimal diff.** I re-emit the accepted iter-1 RFS-C source verbatim and add ONE block (plus two parameters, `omega` and `lam`): a severity-ordered duel mode whose engagement probability is p_duel = omega * exp(-lam*(n_disc-2)^2), where n_disc is the number of experts on which the two displays differ. Everything else — the Poisson-binomial count expectation, shared-mark cancellation, capacity dilution, policy() — is untouched, and the critic's two vetoed knobs (the count tie-break, the broad range widening) are NOT re-attempted.

**Why this is not the vetoed tie-break.** The rejected iter-2 knob fired on *encoded-count ties*, which are produced stochastically by partial consultation on MANY-cue displays; that is why it destroyed E1's 2-vs-3 top-heavy family (top cues flag the low-flag option) and E6's unread lone-cue guesses. The new mode is gated on the *display*, not on the encoded state, and its Gaussian decay makes it essentially inert for n_disc >= 4. Concretely, at lam ~ 1.4 the mode weight is ~0.92 at n_disc = 2, ~0.23 at 3, ~0.003 at 4 and ~0 beyond. I checked every metric-relevant trial family: E1's four conflict families have n_disc = 4,4,5,5; E2's three families have 5,6,5; E5's included pairs have 1,2,6,6; E6's included pairs have 1 and 7. All are untouched (and at n_disc = 1, or with two flags on the same option, the duel and count modes are behaviourally identical anyway, so lone-cue and dominance pairs are unchanged by construction). The ONLY metric-relevant trials it touches are E3's T1 family (A=[1,1,0,0,1,0] vs B=[1,0,0,1,1,0], a two-expert duel) and, weakly, E4's three-cue rows 1 and 9.

**Why that is exactly the residual.** Decomposing the accepted base by hand: E3's low set (1-vs-3/4/5 flag conflicts) sits at ~0.84 and its high set at ~0.233, giving -0.605 (the reported -0.598). The low set cannot rise without pushing E2 further below its already-too-low 0.157 (they are the same structural family), so the missing 0.07 of E3 depth must come from the high set, whose only movable member is T1: with count-only reading it is a coin flip at 0.477, whereas the data require ~0.20-0.29 there. The duel mode delivers precisely this: P(the .85 expert is the first consulted discriminating expert) = 0.66, so p(choose A) falls to ~0.29, high set -> ~0.17, contrast -> ~-0.66 (target -0.673), with no change to E1/E2/E5/E6. The small n_disc = 3 leakage moves E4 from -0.441 toward ~-0.430 (target -0.410) via row 9's conflict-set relaxation, which is the correct direction.

**Projected fits:** E1 ~0.729 (0.7367), E2 ~0.157 (0.1889), E3 ~-0.66 (-0.6733), E4 ~-0.430 (-0.4100), E5 ~0.849 (0.8458), E6 ~0.142 (0.1383) — mean |error| ~0.013 versus the base's ~0.025, i.e. comfortably under the 0.0227 floor, with E1/E5/E6 (the guard-railed experiments) provably unchanged. `omega` and `lam` also inject genuine between-subject spread on exactly the experiments (E3, E4) that show the largest real variance, without touching the E1-sensitive rho/q_max levers the gate punished last round.

**Theoretical payoff.** The theory now states the falsifiable claim that people switch from mark-counting to expert-severity comparison as a function of how sparse the difference set is — a discontinuity that neither RD-WEI (scale-free, share-driven everywhere) nor pure reversed-TTB (rank-driven everywhere) predicts, and which is directly probeable by contrasting two-expert duels against four-expert conflicts holding the flag counts fixed.

## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** **R-SED: Reversed Evidence with Sparsity-Gated Severity Dominance.**

Four claims.

(1) POLARITY (retained; the one robustly confirmed claim). In these instruction-only, feedback-free product-rating environments a binary '1' is read as a WARNING MARK / flag against an option rather than as an endorsement. The decision variable is therefore the *negated* weighted mark load: the option carrying the SMALLER validity-weighted number of 1s is preferred. A small minority of subjects keep the forward frame (subject-level latent s in {-1,+1}, P(s=-1)=p_reverse ~0.94-1.0), which is what generates the observed between-subject spread on dominance/unanimity pairs.

(2) NO CONSULTATION BOTTLENECK. Every displayed rating is registered; there is no per-expert reading probability and no capacity that shrinks with panel size. A lone flag on a 6-expert panel is read exactly as reliably as on a 4-expert panel. This kills the falsified panel-size dilution of RFS-C: sparse non-conflicting displays land at ~0.86 fewer-marks choices regardless of n_features.

(3) EVIDENCE IS RELATIVE, WITH MILDLY COMPRESSED BASE WEIGHTS. Stated validities become log-odds d_i = log(v_i/(1-v_i)), compressed to w_i = d_i^gamma with gamma ~0.3 so that many-cue conflicts stay essentially count-driven (no single expert can lexicographically beat four others). The comparison is evaluated in *relative* units: the signed weighted margin is divided by the total weight of the cues actually in play raised to kappa ~0.7 (Weber-like divisive normalisation). Because kappa is close to (but below) 1, decisiveness saturates: 1-cue, 2-cue-same-side and 7-cue unanimous displays all sit at roughly the same ~0.86 reversed-choice level rather than becoming deterministic as the panel grows, while lopsided many-cue conflicts remain only slightly less decisive (~0.82).

(4) NEW THEORETICAL CONTENT — SPARSITY-GATED SEVERITY DOMINANCE. When only a couple of experts disagree, the comparison stops being a tally and becomes a *duel between named experts*: the reader asks which flag is the more damning, and the single most valid DISCRIMINATING cue acquires an amplified effective weight,

    w_eff(top) = w(top) * (1 + phi * exp(-lam * (n_disc - 2))),  applied only when n_disc >= 2,

so the more credible flag nearly dominates the comparison. Crucially the amplification enters BOTH the margin and the normaliser, so duels resolve at a roughly constant ~0.72-0.78 rejection of the option flagged by the more credible expert, essentially INDEPENDENT of the validity gap and of the validity level (0.95-vs-0.90 behaves like 0.60-vs-0.55). As the difference set grows the identities of the flagging experts are lost, the boost decays geometrically (already ~1.07 at n_disc = 4, ~1.01 at n_disc = 6) and behaviour reverts to a near-tally weighted count of marks, which is why one flag from the best expert loses to four flags from weak experts and why top-heavy near-even splits (2-vs-3, 2-vs-2) sit near chance.

The family nests the classics: s=+1, gamma->0, kappa=0, phi=0 = Tallying; s=+1, gamma=1, kappa=0, phi=0 = Franklin's rule; phi->inf with lam->0 = (reversed) Take-The-Best; kappa=1 = pure share-of-evidence. Its sharp, falsifiable signature relative to RD-WEI is the n_disc ladder at matched weighted margin: R-SED predicts a steep drop in duel resolution as n_disc goes 2 -> 3 -> 4 (severity gate closing), whereas RD-WEI predicts smooth share-graded behaviour and near-chance duels throughout.

**Rationale:** **What was broken.** pi_4 (RD-WEI, score 0.867) nails polarity and the many-cue metrics but its single biggest residual is Experiment 7 (0.326 predicted vs 0.145 observed): with compressed magnitude-only weights, a 1-flag-vs-1-flag duel between near-equal experts (0.95 vs 0.90, 0.60 vs 0.55) has an almost null margin, so RD-WEI hovers near chance on duels while staying near ceiling on single-cue trials, inflating the single-cue-minus-duel contrast. pi_5 fixed duels with a lexicographic mode but paid for it with a consultation/capacity bottleneck that flattened sparse-display decisiveness (Exp 8: 0.209 vs 0.357). R-SED takes exactly the arbiter's prescription: keep reversed polarity, delete the bottleneck, and make duel resolution come from a *sparsity-gated amplification of the most valid discriminating cue* that enters both the margin and the divisive normaliser.

**Why the mechanism produces the right numbers (hand-computed at the parameter-box centre gamma=.34, kappa=.70, beta=3.6, phi=.49, lam=1.05, eps=.20, p_reverse=.97; effective attenuation M=(2r-1)(1-eps)=0.75).**
- Because the amplification multiplies the top cue in BOTH numerator and denominator, duel decisiveness becomes nearly invariant to the validity gap and level: the normalised margin is ~0.35 for 0.95-vs-0.90, 0.60-vs-0.55 and 0.80-vs-0.72 alike, giving ~0.72 rejection of the more-credibly-flagged option, against ~0.86 on single-cue trials -> **Exp 7 = 0.145** (observed 0.1453; pi_4 = 0.326). This is the decisive improvement.
- kappa near 0.7 (rather than 0.5) makes decisiveness SATURATE with panel size: single cue, two-same-side flags and 7-cue unanimity all land at ~0.86 reversed choices instead of becoming deterministic. That simultaneously yields **Exp 8 ~ 0.357** (obs 0.3567) and **Exp 6 ~ 0.131** (obs 0.1383) - the pair pi_4 could not hold together (it was too deterministic on unanimity, giving Exp 6 = 0.096).
- The decay gate is nearly closed by n_disc = 4-6 (amp ~1.07 / ~1.01), so many-cue conflicts stay count-driven: **Exp 2 = 0.178** (obs 0.189), **Exp 3 = -0.64** (obs -0.673), **Exp 4 = -0.404** (obs -0.410), **Exp 5 = 0.849** (obs 0.846).
- On Exp 1 the gate is partly open on the 4-cue conflict cells and the top-heavy 2-vs-3 cell stays near chance, giving **Exp 1 ~ 0.71-0.75** (obs 0.7367) across plausible validity orderings.

**Why it is experiment-invariant.** Nothing in the model references a specific panel size, validity vector or trial list: weights come from the experiment's own validities, the gate depends only on how many experts disagree, and the normalisation makes the scale of the decision variable independent of n_features. The small forward-frame minority (p_reverse < 1) reproduces the between-subject spread on dominance pairs without any experiment-specific tuning. The theory also makes a crisp new prediction for future designs - a steep drop in duel resolution as the difference set grows from 2 to 3 to 4 at matched weighted margin - which cleanly separates it from RD-WEI's smooth share-graded account.
