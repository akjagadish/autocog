# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design dissociates 'Skeptical Tallying' from 'Anti-Expertise Tallying' by contrasting their mechanisms for handling high-validity cues. Skeptical Tallying retains all features in its primary tally but uses low-validity features as a tie-breaker bonus, meaning it will still strongly favor an option with a clear majority of high-validity wins. Conversely, Anti-Expertise Tallying applies a hard threshold, completely discarding features whose validities are deemed too high. By pitting an option with multiple high-validity wins against an option with fewer but lower-validity wins, Skeptical Tallying predicts a choice for the high-validity majority, while Anti-Expertise Tallying (depending on the threshold) will either predict a tie or a win for the low-validity option because the high-validity features have been filtered out.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Skeptical Tallying: Decision-makers primarily rely on a Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other. However, when the tallies are tied (or closely matched), they do not simply guess. Instead, they exhibit skepticism toward the highest-validity cues—perhaps viewing them as redundant, overly salient, or manipulated—and systematically break ties by favoring options that possess more lower-validity features. This is modeled by augmenting the tally score with a secondary component that weights features inversely to their stated validity.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Skeptical Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Primary mechanism: Tallying (count of strict feature-wise wins)
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Secondary mechanism: Tie-breaking favoring lower-validity features
    # Features are weighted by (1 - validity) so that lower validity cues provide a larger bonus.
    tie_breaker_a = np.sum(a * (1.0 - val))
    tie_breaker_b = np.sum(b * (1.0 - val))
    
    # Combine tally with the tie-breaker.
    # gamma controls the strength of the tie-breaker relative to a strict tally win.
    score_a = a_wins + gamma * tie_breaker_a
    score_b = b_wins + gamma * tie_breaker_b
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Anti-Expertise Tallying: Decision-makers actively distrust or ignore high-validity 'expert' cues, perceiving them as overly salient, redundant, or manipulative. Instead of using them, subjects filter out features whose stated validity exceeds a certain personal threshold. After discarding these high-validity cues, subjects apply a standard Tallying heuristic (counting strict feature-wise wins) on the remaining lower-validity features to make their choice.

**Parameters:**
- threshold: [0.5, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Anti-Expertise Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    
    # Filter out features with validity above the threshold
    mask = val <= threshold
    
    # Fallback to all features if the threshold is so low that all features are discarded
    if not np.any(mask):
        mask = np.ones_like(val, dtype=bool)
        
    a_masked = a[mask]
    b_masked = b[mask]
    
    # Tallying on the remaining features
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a_masked > b_masked))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b_masked > a_masked))
    
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

Skeptical Tallying uses the overall tally as its primary mechanism, so it will consistently predict the overall tally winner. Anti-Expertise Tallying, however, drops high-validity features. In this specific experimental design, dropping the top two highest-validity features completely reverses the tally winner in half of the trials (Trials 3, 5, and 6). Because the threshold for Anti-Expertise Tallying frequently falls below the top validities, its simulated data will show a substantially lower rate of agreement with the overall tally winner compared to Skeptical Tallying."
