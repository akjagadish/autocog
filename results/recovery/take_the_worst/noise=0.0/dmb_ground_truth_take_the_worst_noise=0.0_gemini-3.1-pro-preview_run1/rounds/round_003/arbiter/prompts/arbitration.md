# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking: People primarily compare options by counting the number of features where one option dominates the other, ignoring feature validities (Tallying). However, if the options are tied in their feature tallies, individuals do not simply guess; instead, they consult the feature validities and break the tie using a lexicographic Take-The-Best (TTB) approach, choosing the option favored by the most valid discriminating cue.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To dissociate Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking from standard Tallying, we construct critical trials where the two options are tied in their feature tallies. Standard Tallying predicts a 50/50 guess in these cases, regardless of the validities. By contrast, Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking predicts that subjects will use the highest-validity discriminating feature to break the tie. The design includes trials with exact tally ties where the most valid cue favors Option A or Option B, allowing a clear quantitative dissociation between the two theories. We also include filler trials where one option wins the tally to ensure subjects remain engaged with the primary strategy.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates trials where the two options are tied in their overall tally (i.e., each option wins on the same number of features). According to the Competing theory (pure Tallying), subjects will simply guess on these trials, resulting in a ~50% consistency with any tie-breaking rule. The Advocated theory, however, posits that subjects use a lexicographic rule (Take-The-Best) to break ties, relying on the single most valid discriminating feature. By calculating the proportion of choices that align with the highest-validity discriminating feature specifically on tie trials, we expect a value near 1.0 (minus noise) for the Advocated theory and exactly 0.5 for the Competing theory.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To cleanly dissociate standard Tallying from Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking, the design focuses heavily on trials where the two options have an equal number of feature wins (a tally tie). According to the advocated theory (standard Tallying), subjects will guess uniformly at random on these trials because the tally is tied. According to the competing theory, subjects will break the tie using the single most valid discriminating feature. By varying which option is favored by the highest-validity cue during tally ties, we can observe whether choices remain near 50% or shift strongly toward the tie-breaker cue. Filler trials where one option wins the tally are included to prevent subjects from noticing that most trials are ties.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Calculates the proportion of times the subject chooses the option favored by the most valid discriminating cue on trials where the simple feature tally is tied. The Tallying theory predicts this will be around 0.5 (guessing), while the Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking theory predicts a value significantly higher than 0.5.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the experiments, Tallying clearly emerges as the dominant strategy. In Experiments 5, 6, and 8, subjects consistently choose the option with more positive features, even when the opposing option possesses the highest-validity cues (which strongly contradicts pure Take-The-Best or purely linear WADD models). However, Theory 1 (Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking) completely fails to predict behavior on tally ties. In Experiment 1, it predicted an 85% adherence to the highest-validity cue on ties, but the observed rate was 33%, actively contradicting the lexicographic tie-breaker. Theory 2 (pure Tallying) predicts 50% on ties, which is closer but still misses the systematic deviation. A new theory is needed that integrates validities smoothly rather than using a rigid step-function tie-breaker.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Weighted Tallying' or 'Non-linear WADD' theory. Instead of a strict lexicographic tie-breaker, assume subjects compute a weighted sum of features where the weights are a heavily compressed function of the stated validities (e.g., w_i = validity_i ** gamma, with gamma close to 0 but slightly positive). This allows the model to act almost exactly like Tallying when one option has a clear numerical advantage in features (capturing Exps 4, 5, 6, 8), but smoothly resolves ties using all available validity information rather than just the single best cue, avoiding the catastrophic failure of Theory 1 on Exp 1."
