# generation_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Propose a 'Strategy Selection' or 'Mixture' theory. Instead of assuming all subjects use a single heuristic, this theory should posit that decision-makers probabilistically draw from a repertoire of strategies (e.g., Tallying and WADD, or Tallying and Take-The-Best) depending on trial characteristics or individual differences. A mixture model with a parameter controlling the probability of deploying Tallying vs. a validity-weighted strategy will maintain the strong Tallying predictions for Exps 1-3 while naturally capturing the tempered Tallying consistency observed in Exp 4.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.661)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.2134 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2779 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.2747 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.3979 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2134 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Strategy Selection (Mixture of Tallying and WADD): Decision-makers do not exclusively rely on a single heuristic. Instead, they probabilistically select between a frugal, unweighted strategy (Tallying) and a fully compensatory, validity-weighted strategy (WADD). The probability of deploying Tallying varies across individuals but generally dominates, which explains the strong Tallying-like choices in most environments. However, the presence of the WADD strategy in the mixture tempers the extremeness of Tallying predictions, naturally capturing the reduced consistency observed in certain cue conflict configurations.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # 1. Tallying strategy scores
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores_tally = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    
    # 2. WADD strategy scores
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    score_a = np.dot(a, val)
    score_b = np.dot(b, val)
    scores_wadd = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    w_tally = float(parameters["w_tally"])
    
    # Softmax for Tallying
    z_tally = beta * (scores_tally - np.max(scores_tally))
    e_tally = np.exp(z_tally)
    p_tally = e_tally / np.sum(e_tally)
    
    # Softmax for WADD
    z_wadd = beta * (scores_wadd - np.max(scores_wadd))
    e_wadd = np.exp(z_wadd)
    p_wadd = e_wadd / np.sum(e_wadd)
    
    # Mixture of the two strategies
    p_core = w_tally * p_tally + (1.0 - w_tally) * p_wadd
    
    # Apply lapse rate
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    p_final = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
    
    return p_final


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- w_tally: [0.5, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory instantiates a strategy selection mechanism where decision-makers probabilistically draw from both Tallying and WADD. By defining a mixture weight (w_tally) that favors Tallying (constrained to [0.5, 1.0]), the model maintains the strong Tallying predictions required for Exps 1-3. At the same time, the inclusion of WADD tempers the overly deterministic Tallying predictions, pulling the choice probabilities closer to the empirical data in scenarios like Exp 4 where Tallying consistency is lower. This hybrid approach overcomes the rigidity of assuming a single monolithic heuristic across all trials.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory successfully implements the prescribed strategy selection between Tallying and WADD, achieving an accepted loss. However, it overestimates Tallying consistency in Experiment 2 (predicted 0.84 vs observed 0.61) while underestimating it in Experiments 3 and 4 (e.g., Exp 4 predicted 0.69 vs observed 0.86). This discrepancy likely arises because the Tallying scores (integers up to 5) and WADD scores (sum of validities) exist on different scales, but share a single `beta` parameter. Additionally, artificially restricting `w_tally` to [0.5, 1.0] prevents the model from fully exploring the parameter space to find the optimal balance.
Rationale: To improve the fit within the prescribed Mixture family: 1) Expand the range of `w_tally` to [0.0, 1.0] so the optimization can freely weight the strategies. 2) Introduce separate inverse temperature parameters for Tallying (`beta_tally`) and WADD (`beta_wadd`), or normalize the scores before applying a single beta. This will account for the different scales of the unweighted and validity-weighted score functions, allowing the model to capture the nuanced choice probabilities across Exps 2, 3, and 4.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2134 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2779 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was rejected by the accept gate because the aggregate loss increased. The previous advice to introduce separate temperature parameters (beta_tally and beta_wadd) likely expanded the parameter space too much, causing the optimization to find a poor minimum and worsening the fit on Experiments 3 and 4. The underlying issue of scaling mismatches between Tallying and WADD remains, but we need a solution that does not require extra parameters.
Rationale: Since adding separate beta parameters was rejected, revert to using a single `beta` parameter to keep the optimization stable. To solve the scaling mismatch between Tallying (integer counts) and WADD (summed validities), normalize the scores of each strategy by their maximum possible values before applying the softmax. For example, divide the Tallying scores by the total number of features, and divide the WADD scores by the sum of all validities. This bounds both score sets to [0, 1], allowing a single `beta` to correctly calibrate the noise for both strategies. Retain the probabilistic mixture of these normalized softmax outputs using `w_tally` in [0.0, 1.0].

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2779 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.2747 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was rejected by the accept gate. The previous advice to normalize the Tallying and WADD scores by their maximums before applying the softmax actually worsened the fit on Experiments 3 and 4, pulling the model further from the empirical preference for Tallying in Exp 4. The normalization likely compressed the score differences too much, making the choice probabilities too uniform unless beta compensated perfectly, which the optimizer failed to find.
Rationale: Since normalizing the scores was rejected and worsened the fit, revert to using raw, unnormalized scores as in the last accepted base (Iter 1). To improve upon that base while staying within the prescribed Strategy Selection family, try switching the compensatory strategy in the mixture: instead of a mixture of Tallying and WADD, implement a mixture of Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB), as explicitly offered in the arbiter's recommendation. TTB should simply assign a score of 1 to the option that wins on the highest-validity discriminating cue, and 0 to the other. Use a single beta for the softmax of both strategies' raw scores, and keep the mixture weight `w_tally` in [0.0, 1.0].

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.2747 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.3979 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was rejected by the accept gate. The switch from a Tallying/WADD mixture to a Tallying/TTB mixture severely degraded the fit, increasing the aggregate loss to 0.3979. The TTB mixture completely fails to capture the empirical behavior in Experiment 1 and Experiment 4. The accepted Iteration 1 base, which mixed Tallying and WADD, remains the most promising implementation of the arbiter's Strategy Selection recommendation.
Rationale: Revert completely to the Tallying and WADD mixture used in the accepted Iteration 1 base. The previous attempts to improve that base failed because they introduced complicating mechanics (separate betas, score normalization, or switching to TTB). To improve upon the Iteration 1 base, make exactly ONE minimal adjustment: expand the `w_tally` parameter range from [0.5, 1.0] to [0.0, 1.0]. Keep a single `beta` parameter and use raw, unnormalized scores for both Tallying (integer counts) and WADD (summed validities). This will allow the optimizer to freely calibrate the strategy mixture without altering the fundamental score distributions.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.3979 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
