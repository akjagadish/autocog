# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Tallying with a Sub-optimal Tie-Breaker (Negative Cue-Weighting in Ties): Decision-makers primarily compare options using a frugal Tallying heuristic, choosing the option with the greater number of winning cues. However, when options are tied on the number of winning features, individuals do not simply guess or use a rational compensatory strategy. Instead, they exhibit a sub-optimal tie-breaking mechanism where they systematically favor the option with lower-ranked or lower-validity cues (effectively a Negative WADD score). This explains both the strong adherence to Tallying when cue counts differ, and the counter-intuitive preference for lower-validity options when cue counts are tied.

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Misinterpreted Expert Ratings (Mixture of Standard Tallying and Reverse WADD): Decision-makers consist of two sub-populations. One group understands the instructions correctly and uses a standard Tallying heuristic, choosing the option with more positive features. A second group misinterprets the binary expert ratings as 'defects' or 'costs' (1 = bad, 0 = good) and evaluates options using a Reverse WADD strategy, minimizing the validity-weighted sum of these perceived defects. In scenarios where Tallying and Reverse WADD agree, choice consistency is high. When they disagree, they pull the aggregate preference in opposite directions, weakening the apparent Tallying effect. Crucially, when options tie under Tallying, the standard group guesses uniformly, allowing the Reverse WADD group to entirely drive the aggregate behavior, resulting in a strong 'Negative WADD' effect.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [1.0, 0.9, 0.6, 0.5, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the Advocated Theory (Tallying with Negative WADD tie-breaker) from the Competing Theory (Mixture of Standard Tallying and Reverse WADD) by focusing on non-tie trials. Under the Advocated Theory, when options do not tie on the number of winning cues, the decision is driven exclusively by Tallying; the magnitude of the WADD or Negative WADD difference is completely ignored. Thus, across multiple trials where the Tallying difference is held constant (e.g., Option A always wins exactly one more cue than Option B), the Advocated Theory predicts an identical choice probability for Option A. In contrast, the Competing Theory posits a mixture of Tallying and Reverse WADD across all trials. Because Reverse WADD penalizes options with a higher validity-weighted sum of 1s (interpreting them as defects), it is often in tension with Tallying. By holding the Tallying difference constant at +1 for Option A but systematically varying the Reverse WADD difference from strongly favoring B to favoring A, the Competing Theory predicts a steeply varying choice probability across these trials, while the Advocated Theory predicts a perfectly flat line.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the difference in the probability of choosing Option A between Trial 5 and Trial 1. Under the Advocated Theory, the choice probability relies entirely on Tallying on these non-tie trials. Since Option A wins by exactly one cue in both Trial 1 and Trial 5, the choice probability for A should be identical (metric ~ 0). Under the Competing Theory, decision-making is a mixture of Tallying and Reverse WADD. While Tallying favors A equally in both trials, Reverse WADD strongly favors B in Trial 1 but favors A in Trial 5. Consequently, the Competing Theory predicts a substantially higher probability of choosing A in Trial 5 than in Trial 1, yielding a positive metric value.

  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the Advocated Theory (Mixture of Standard Tallying and Reverse WADD) from the Competing Theory (Tallying with Negative WADD tie-breaker) by focusing on non-tie trials. Under the Competing Theory, when options do not tie on the number of winning cues, the decision is driven exclusively by Tallying; the magnitude of the WADD or Reverse WADD difference is completely ignored. Thus, across multiple trials where the Tallying difference is held constant (e.g., Option A always wins exactly one more cue than Option B), the Competing Theory predicts an identical choice probability for Option A. In contrast, the Advocated Theory posits a mixture of Tallying and Reverse WADD across all trials. By holding the Tallying difference constant at +1 for Option A but systematically varying the Reverse WADD difference from strongly favoring B to actually favoring A, the Advocated Theory predicts a steeply varying choice probability across these trials, while the Competing Theory predicts a perfectly flat line. Tie trials are also included to anchor the Negative/Reverse WADD effect.

**Computed schedule:** 7 unique pairs × 13 reps = 91 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the difference in the probability of choosing Option A between Trial 1 and Trial 2. In both trials, Option A wins on exactly one more cue than Option B (Tallying difference is +1). According to the Competing Theory, decision-makers rely exclusively on Tallying in non-tie scenarios, so the choice probability for Option A should be identical across both trials, yielding a metric value near 0. In contrast, the Advocated Theory posits a mixture of Tallying and Reverse WADD. While the Tallying component favors A equally in both trials, the Reverse WADD component slightly favors A in Trial 1 but strongly favors B in Trial 2. Therefore, the Advocated Theory predicts a significantly higher probability of choosing A in Trial 1 compared to Trial 2, yielding a large positive metric value.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the experiments, the data strongly suggests that subjects are misinterpreting the binary features (1s) as 'defects' or 'costs' rather than positive attributes. However, while Theory 2 (pi_6) correctly identifies this misinterpretation, it incorrectly assumes a 'Reverse WADD' integration strategy. Under Reverse WADD, subjects would sum the validity-weighted defects and choose the option with the lower sum. If we look at Experiment 4, Reverse WADD predicts choices that are exactly opposite to Tallying on almost every trial, which would yield a metric near 0.0. Instead, the observed metric in Exp 4 is 0.6089, showing a positive correlation with Tallying. This paradox is resolved by a 'Reverse Take-The-Best' (Reverse TTB) strategy: subjects evaluate options lexicographically, looking for the first cue where options differ, and penalize the option with a '1' (defect) on that cue. Reverse TTB perfectly predicts the massive positive shifts in Experiments 1 and 2, while also aligning with Tallying on 5 out of 6 valid trials in Experiment 4 (unlike Reverse WADD, which aligns on 0). Therefore, the 'Reverse WADD' mechanism in Theory 2 needs to be replaced with a 'Reverse TTB' mechanism.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Reverse Take-The-Best' (Reverse TTB) theory. The core premise is that subjects misinterpret the '1's as defects or costs. Because they are boundedly rational, they do not integrate these defects additively (as in Reverse WADD). Instead, they process the cues lexicographically in order of validity. They compare options on the most valid cue; if one option has a '1' (defect) and the other has a '0' (no defect), they immediately choose the option with the '0'. If they tie, they move to the next cue. This elegantly explains the strong preference for options with fewer high-validity 1s (Exps 1, 2, 6, 9) while also explaining why their choices spuriously correlate with standard Tallying in designs like Exp 4 where the Reverse TTB choice happens to have more 1s overall."
