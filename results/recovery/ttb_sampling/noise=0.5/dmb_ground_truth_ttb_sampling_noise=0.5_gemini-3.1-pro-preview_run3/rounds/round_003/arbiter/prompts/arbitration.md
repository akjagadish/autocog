# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic: People make binary choices by evaluating features sequentially in descending order of their validity. The first feature that discriminates between the two options (i.e., one option has a higher value than the other) entirely determines the choice, and all remaining features are ignored. This strictly non-compensatory strategy allows decision makers to heavily weight highly predictive cues without needing to compute complex compensatory trade-offs.

## THEORY 2 — pi_4
Strategy Mixture Theory: Decision-makers do not uniformly apply a single choice rule. Instead, they possess a repertoire of strategies and flexibly draw from them. On any given trial, a subject acts as a mixture model, choosing to apply a non-compensatory heuristic (Take-The-Best) with probability alpha, and a compensatory rule (Weighted Additive / Tallying) with probability 1 - alpha. The compensatory rule weights features by its subjective validities, naturally subsuming Tallying and WADD. Crucially, the compensatory scores are normalized to the [0, 1] scale to perfectly match the scale of the heuristic's discrete scores, allowing a single temperature parameter to symmetrically control the determinism of both strategies without numerical compromise.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 10: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate pure Take-The-Best (TTB) from the Strategy Mixture Theory (which posits a mixture of TTB and compensatory strategies like WADD), we need trials where TTB and WADD make strongly opposing predictions. By using an environment where the most valid cue is outweighed by the sum of the remaining cues, we create 'compensatory' trials. Pure TTB will consistently and confidently choose the option favored by the highest-validity discriminating cue. In contrast, the Strategy Mixture Theory will predict a softer, mixed probability, or even a preference for the opposite option (depending on the mixture weight alpha), because the WADD component strongly pulls the prediction in the opposite direction. Including trials where the first cue is tied extends this dissociation to lower-validity cues.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that are consistent with the Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic specifically on 'compensatory' trials. In these trials, the most valid discriminating cue points to one option, but the sum of all other cues points strongly to the other. Pure TTB will consistently choose the option favored by the single best cue, resulting in a metric close to 1.0 (modulo lapses). The Strategy Mixture Theory, however, posits that a compensatory strategy (like WADD) is sometimes used, which will strongly favor the opposite option on these specific trials, pulling the expected value of this metric significantly downward.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_4)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**

  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate pure Take-The-Best (TTB) from Strategy Mixture Theory, we construct a series of 'compensatory' trials where the single highest-validity discriminating cue strongly favors one option, but the sum of the remaining cues strongly favors the other option. Pure TTB strictly follows the highest-validity cue and ignores the rest, predicting a deterministic choice for the TTB-favored option. In contrast, the Strategy Mixture Theory blends TTB with a compensatory rule (WADD/Tallying). Because the compensatory component strongly favors the opposite option, the mixture model predicts a softer probability distribution, systematically deviating from pure TTB. By including trials where the first cue is tied, we extend this dissociation to secondary and tertiary cues.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design consists of 'compensatory' trials where the most valid discriminating cue favors one option, but the sum of the remaining cues heavily favors the other option. Pure Take-The-Best (TTB) strictly follows the highest-validity cue and ignores the rest, predicting a choice consistent with this first cue deterministically (modulo decision noise). In contrast, the Strategy Mixture Theory blends TTB with a compensatory rule (WADD/Tallying) that favors the opposite option. This blending will substantially reduce the probability of choosing the TTB-favored option. By calculating the overall proportion of choices that align with the TTB prediction, we can strongly discriminate between the two theories: TTB will produce a score close to 1.0, while Strategy Mixture Theory will produce a noticeably lower score.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all experiments, Theory 1 (pure Take-The-Best) consistently overestimates the reliance on the single most valid cue, predicting TTB-consistent choices in the 0.83-0.87 range on compensatory trials. The observed data consistently shows a much softer reliance, typically around 0.67. Theory 2 (Strategy Mixture Theory) performs significantly better by blending TTB with a compensatory weighted-additive rule, yielding predictions that are much closer to the observed data (e.g., 0.57-0.72 on compensatory trials). Because pure TTB is systematically and strongly falsified by the intermediate choice proportions, Theory 1 is degenerate and should be replaced with a stronger competitor.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Probabilistic Cue Search' or 'Sequential Evidence Accumulation' theory. Instead of a strict deterministic evaluation order (pure TTB) or a discrete coin-flip between two entirely different strategies (Mixture Theory), this theory should posit that decision-makers accumulate evidence from cues sequentially. The stopping rule or the cue evaluation order is probabilistic (e.g., cues are sampled proportional to their validities, or decision-makers stop searching with some probability after each cue). This naturally produces soft, graded choices that lie between pure TTB and pure WADD without requiring a discrete mixture of distinct heuristics."
