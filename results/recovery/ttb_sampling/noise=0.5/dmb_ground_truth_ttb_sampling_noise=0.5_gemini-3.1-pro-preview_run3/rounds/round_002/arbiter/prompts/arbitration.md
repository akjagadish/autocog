# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_2_1") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2_1" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic: People make binary choices by evaluating features sequentially in descending order of their validity. The first feature that discriminates between the two options (i.e., one option has a higher value than the other) entirely determines the choice, and all remaining features are ignored. This strictly non-compensatory strategy allows decision makers to heavily weight highly predictive cues without needing to compute complex compensatory trade-offs.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2_1
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.65, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design robustly dissociates the non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic from the compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) rule. By using a set of features with a steep drop-off in validities (e.g., one highly predictive feature and several moderately predictive ones), we can construct trials where the most valid feature strongly favors one option, but the combined weight of the remaining features favors the other. TTB will strictly choose the option endorsed by the single highest-validity discriminating feature and ignore the rest. WADD, by contrast, integrates all features, allowing a deficit on the highest-validity cue to be compensated by a sufficient advantage on the lower-validity cues. We also include trials where both models agree, as well as trials where the critical dissociation occurs on the second most valid feature (when the first feature is tied).

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with the strictly non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. Because the experimental design contains many trials where the single most valid feature is contradicted by the sum of the remaining features, TTB and WADD yield opposing predictions on these trials. TTB simulates will consistently produce a high proportion of TTB-aligned choices (limited only by noise), while WADD simulates (which are compensatory for most of the gamma parameter space) will frequently choose the option favored by the lower-validity cues, resulting in a significantly lower TTB-alignment score.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design robustly dissociates the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule from the non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. By using a set of five features with linearly decreasing validities, we can create critical 'compensatory' trials where the single highest-validity discriminating feature favors one option (which TTB will strictly choose), but the sum of the remaining lower-validity features favors the other option (which WADD will choose). We include variations where the highest-validity feature is tied, shifting the TTB decision to the second or third feature, while WADD still integrates all available information. Control trials where both models agree are also included.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the probability of choosing Option B on 'compensatory' trials. These are trials specifically designed so that the highest-validity discriminating feature favors Option B (which Take-The-Best will strictly follow, predicting a response near 1.0), but the sheer number of remaining lower-validity features favors Option A (which Weighted Additive will integrate, predicting a response near 0.0). By restricting the analysis only to these critical trials, we achieve maximal separation between the two theories.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all experiments, the observed metric values consistently fall between the predictions of the pure Take-The-Best (TTB, pi_3) and pure Weighted Additive (WADD, pi_2_1) theories. For instance, in Experiment 2, TTB predicts an 86% choice rate for the TTB-favored option, WADD predicts 30%, and the observed rate is 67%. Similarly, in Experiment 1, TTB predicts 85%, WADD predicts 50%, and the observed is 68%. This robust intermediate behavior strongly suggests that neither a strictly non-compensatory nor a strictly compensatory model adequately describes the population. Instead, the data likely reflects a mixture of strategies across the population (or within subjects across trials), where some decisions are made using a fast-and-frugal heuristic like TTB, and others are made using compensatory integration.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Strategy Mixture' theory. Instead of assuming all subjects uniformly apply a single rule, this theory should posit that decision-makers draw from a repertoire of strategies. Specifically, on any given trial (or for any given subject), there is a probability 'alpha' of using the Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic and a probability '1 - alpha' of using a compensatory rule (like WADD or Tallying). This mixture approach will naturally capture the intermediate choice proportions observed across all experiments, blending the distinct predictions of the two extremes."
