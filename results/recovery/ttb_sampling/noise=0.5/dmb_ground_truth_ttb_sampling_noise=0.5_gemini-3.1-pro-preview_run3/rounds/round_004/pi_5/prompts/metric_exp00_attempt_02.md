# metric_exp00_attempt_02

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design aims to quantitatively dissociate Probabilistic Cue Search (PCS) from Strategy Mixture Theory (SMT) by exploiting how they handle intermediate evidence. SMT posits a discrete mixture between a single-cue heuristic (TTB) and an exhaustive compensatory rule (WADD). In contrast, PCS accumulates evidence sequentially across discriminating cues, with a probability of stopping at each step. By designing trials where the first cue favors Option A, but the subsequent cues sequentially build a strong case for Option B before a final cue swings the balance back or maintains it, we can expose PCS's unique intermediate stopping states. For example, trials where the accumulated evidence briefly favors B in the middle of the search will pull PCS's predicted choice probabilities in ways that SMT (which only sees the first cue or the total sum) cannot mimic. We include a mix of trials where TTB and WADD agree, where they conflict strongly, and where intermediate cues create 'traps' for sequential accumulators.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Probabilistic Cue Search (Sequential Evidence Accumulation): Decision-makers evaluate features sequentially in descending order of validity. However, instead of strictly stopping at the first discriminating cue (as in pure Take-The-Best) or exhaustively accumulating all cues (as in Weighted Additive), they exhibit a probabilistic stopping rule. After evaluating each discriminating cue and updating their internal evidence, they stop searching and make a choice with probability `theta`. If they do not stop, they continue to the next discriminating cue, accumulating its evidence. This naturally produces a graded interpolation between non-compensatory and compensatory decision-making without relying on a discrete mixture of distinct strategies.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Strategy Mixture Theory: Decision-makers do not uniformly apply a single choice rule. Instead, they possess a repertoire of strategies and flexibly draw from them. On any given trial, a subject acts as a mixture model, choosing to apply a non-compensatory heuristic (Take-The-Best) with probability alpha, and a compensatory rule (Weighted Additive / Tallying) with probability 1 - alpha. The compensatory rule weights features by its subjective validities, naturally subsuming Tallying and WADD. Crucially, the compensatory scores are normalized to the [0, 1] scale to perfectly match the scale of the heuristic's discrete scores, allowing a single temperature parameter to symmetrically control the determinism of both strategies without numerical compromise.

**Parameters:**
- alpha: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
[0] rationale: On Trial 2, Option A has features 1, 4, and 5, while Option B has features 2 and 3. Under Strategy Mixture Theory, both Take-The-Best (which looks only at feature 1) and Weighted Additive (which sums all features) strongly favor Option A. Thus, SMT predicts subjects will rarely choose Option B. However, Probabilistic Cue Search evaluates features sequentially. After evaluating the first three features, the accumulated evidence temporarily favors Option B (0.85 + 0.75 = 1.60 for B vs 0.95 for A). Because PCS has a probability of stopping at this intermediate step, it predicts a significantly higher rate of choosing Option B on this trial compared to SMT.

[1] rationale: Contrasts the proportion of choosing Option B between Trial 5 and Trial 2. In Trial 5, Strategy Mixture Theory (SMT) often chooses B because its compensatory rule (WADD) favors B, whereas Probabilistic Cue Search (PCS) almost never chooses B because A strongly leads throughout the first four sequential steps. Conversely, in Trial 2, SMT rarely chooses B (both TTB and WADD favor A), while PCS chooses B more frequently because B temporarily takes the lead at step 3. Therefore, SMT predicts a positive difference (more B choices in Trial 5 than Trial 2), while PCS predicts a negative or near-zero difference.
