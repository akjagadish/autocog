# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_5") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
People use the 'Take The Best' (TTB) heuristic, a non-compensatory lexicographic strategy. They evaluate features sequentially in descending order of their validities and stop at the first feature that discriminates between the options. The option with the higher value on this decisive feature is chosen. If no feature discriminates, they guess. Behavior incorporates response noise and lapses.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    score_a = 0.0
    score_b = 0.0
    
    # Find the first discriminating feature
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            score_a = 1.0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            score_b = 1.0
            break
            
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax for response noise
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))

    import numpy as np
    p = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=float)
    p = p / np.sum(p)
    return int(np.random.choice(len(p), p=p))


## THEORY 2 — pi_5
Exponentially Weighted Additive Model: Subjects integrate all available features in a compensatory manner, but they apply a steep non-linear (exponential) transformation to the feature validities. This causes the most valid features to heavily dominate the decision, effectively mimicking the non-compensatory 'Take The Best' heuristic while remaining mathematically compensatory. The steepness of this transformation dictates how closely the strategy approximates strict lexicographic choice.

    # Calculate option scores as weighted sums
    scores = stim @ weights
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.94, 0.93, 0.92, 0.91]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic from the Exponentially Weighted Additive Model, this design exploits the upper bound on the Exponential model's 'gamma' parameter (max 20.0). By choosing feature validities that are extremely close to one another, the exponential transformation is mathematically unable to make the single highest-validity feature outweigh the sum of the remaining features. Consequently, the Exponential model is forced to make compensatory predictions on critical trials. In contrast, TTB strictly follows the lexicographic order and will consistently choose the option favored by the single highest-validity discriminating feature, regardless of how many lower-validity features oppose it.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design uses feature validities that are very close to one another, preventing the Exponential model from making the most valid feature outweigh the sum of several less valid features. In trials where Option A has fewer total positive features than Option B (sum(A) < sum(B)) but possesses the single most valid discriminating feature, the Take The Best (TTB) model will consistently choose Option A. Conversely, the Exponential model will choose Option B because the combined weight of the numerous lower-validity features exceeds the weight of the single high-validity feature. By calculating the proportion of these specific trials where the subject chooses Option A, we can starkly discriminate the two models: TTB predicts a value near 1.0, while the Exponential model predicts a value near 0.0.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 10: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the Exponentially Weighted Additive Model from Take The Best (TTB) by exploiting TTB's insensitivity to the amount of opposing lower-validity evidence. Across a sequence of trials, Option A is supported by the single highest-validity discriminating feature, while Option B is supported by an increasing number of lower-validity features. Because TTB evaluates features sequentially and stops at the first discriminating feature, it assigns a constant internal score difference (1 vs 0) for all these trials, predicting a completely flat choice probability for Option A across the gradient. In contrast, the Exponential model mathematically integrates all features (even when transformed exponentially), predicting a graded decrease in the preference for Option A as the opposing evidence for Option B accumulates. This graded compensatory response pattern is uniquely predicted by the Exponential model and cannot be captured by TTB's strict lexicographic stopping rule.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Under the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic, Option A is supported by the highest-validity feature on every single trial. Any choices for Option B are purely random lapses, meaning the rate of choosing B should be identical regardless of how many lower-validity features Option B possesses. Under the Exponentially Weighted Additive Model, subjects act in a compensatory manner, so the probability of choosing Option B increases significantly when it has a strong numerical advantage in features. By contrasting the choice rate on trials where Option B has 3 or 4 positive features against trials where it has only 1, we isolate the strongest compensatory signal. This produces a much larger gap between the two theories than comparing against trials with 2 positive features, while still using enough trials per subject to maintain low baseline sampling variance.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).

In Experiment 1, TTB closely predicts the observed metric (0.6885 vs 0.6468) while the Exponential model predicts a much lower value (0.2397). In Experiment 2, TTB correctly predicts that the choice rate is insensitive to the number of opposing lower-validity features (observed -0.0207, pi_3 0.0141), whereas the Exponential model predicts a large compensatory effect (0.2067). Similar patterns hold in Experiments 4, 5, 6, and 7, where pi_3 is consistently closer to the observed data. The Exponential model's attempt to mimic lexicographic behavior via steep compensatory weights fails to capture the strict non-compensatory bounds seen in human data. Because pi_3 is already highly accurate, pi_5 should be replaced with a completely new theoretical framework.",

  "recommendation": "Propose a brand-new theory to replace the Exponentially Weighted Additive Model. Since TTB is highly successful but might not capture all trial-by-trial variance, a strong competitor would be a Strategy Selection or Mixture Model (where subjects probabilistically switch between TTB and a simple compensatory strategy like Tallying based on the choice environment), or a Sequential Sampling Model (where features are sampled over time with probabilities proportional to their validities, accumulating evidence until a threshold is reached). This would provide a structurally different mechanism from both strict TTB and static WADD."
