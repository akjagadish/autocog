# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People use the 'Take The Best' (TTB) heuristic, a non-compensatory lexicographic strategy. They evaluate features sequentially in descending order of their validities and stop at the first feature that discriminates between the options. The option with the higher value on this decisive feature is chosen. If no feature discriminates, they guess. Behavior incorporates response noise and lapses.

**Rationale:** The Take The Best (TTB) heuristic is a non-compensatory, lexicographic decision strategy. We maintain the exact same mechanism as the previous candidate, but adjust the parameter ranges for `beta` (shifted to lower values: [0.01, 5.0]) and `epsilon` (upper bound increased to 1.0). This allows the optimization process to inject enough stochasticity to bridge the gap between pure TTB's extreme predictions (~0.15) and human behavior (~0.30-0.36).

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.01, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    score_a = 0.0
    score_b = 0.0
    
    # Find the first discriminating feature
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            score_a = 1.0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            score_b = 1.0
            break
            
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax for response noise
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    p = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=float)
    p = p / np.sum(p)
    return int(np.random.choice(len(p), p=p))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Bounded Sequential Feature Sampling: Subjects evaluate features in decreasing order of validity, accumulating unweighted evidence (the net difference in feature values) until a low internal threshold is reached. If the threshold is met, search terminates and a choice is made; if all features are exhausted, the choice is based on whatever net evidence was accumulated. This generalizes 'Take The Best' by allowing for a 'Take The Two' or similar heuristic where more than one discriminating feature may be required to reach a decision.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we revert to the unweighted evidence accumulation mechanism since validity-weighting worsened the fit. To improve the balance between TTB and tallying behavior, we expand the threshold to {1, 2, 3}, allowing the model to smoothly transition from pure Take-The-Best (threshold=1) to 'Take The Two' or simple tallying. Furthermore, we increase the beta range to [5.0, 20.0] to sharpen softmax probabilities and ensure deterministic choices when the threshold is met.

**Parameters:**
  - `threshold`: `{1, 2, 3}`
  - `beta`: `[5.0, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.2]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    threshold = int(parameters["threshold"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    E = 0.0
    # Accumulate evidence until threshold is met
    for idx in order:
        E += (a[idx] - b[idx])
        if abs(E) >= threshold:
            break
            
    # Scores based on accumulated evidence
    scores = np.array([E, -E])
    
    # Softmax for response noise
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```
