# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2_1`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2_1`).

Propose a new theory such as 'Rank-Dependent Weighting' or a 'Strategy Selection / Mixture' model. A Rank-Dependent Weighting model would assign subjective weights to features based solely on their validity rank (e.g., exponentially decaying weights) rather than their raw validity values. This would allow the model to behave non-compensatorily (like TTB) when the decay is steep, but still integrate multiple cues when the top cues tie or when the decay is moderate, better capturing the intermediate variance seen in Experiments 3 and 4 without completely failing on the strict dissociation designs of Experiments 1 and 2.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Rank-Dependent Weighting posits that decision-makers assign subjective weights to features based on their validity rank rather than their raw validity values. The most valid feature receives the highest weight, and subsequent features receive exponentially decaying weights controlled by a decay parameter. This mechanism allows the model to smoothly interpolate between non-compensatory, lexicographic decision-making (like Take The Best) when the decay is steep, and compensatory, equal-weight integration (like Tallying) when the decay is gradual. The weighted sums for each option are then compared using a softmax choice rule with an independent lapse rate.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Determine the rank of each feature (0 for highest validity)
    order = np.argsort(-validities)
    ranks = np.empty_like(validities)
    ranks[order] = np.arange(len(validities))
    
    # Calculate rank-dependent weights with exponential decay
    lambda_decay = float(parameters["lambda_decay"])
    weights = lambda_decay ** ranks
    
    # Calculate scores for each option
    scores = stim @ weights
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse rate
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)

`parameters`:
- lambda_decay: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's suggestion, this Rank-Dependent Weighting model ignores the raw validity magnitudes and instead uses their rank order to assign exponentially decaying weights. By varying the decay parameter (`lambda_decay`), the model can exhibit non-compensatory behavior (matching Take The Best when decay is steep) or compensatory behavior (when decay is moderate to high). This flexibility allows it to capture the intermediate variance observed in Experiments 3 and 4, while still being able to reproduce the strict dissociations found in Experiments 1 and 2, which purely magnitude-based WADD or purely lexicographic TTB struggle to balance simultaneously.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1831 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1831.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Rank-Dependent Weighting model with exponential decay successfully reduced the aggregate loss and was ACCEPTED by the gate. It captures the intermediate variance in Experiments 3 and 4 quite well. However, it still struggles slightly with Experiment 5 (TTB match: real=0.69 vs cand=0.54) and Experiment 6 (WADD match: real=0.32 vs cand=0.48). The exponential decay (lambda_decay ** rank) might be too aggressive, forcing the model into either extreme lexicographic behavior or completely uniform weights, leaving a sparse middle ground.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "While the Rank-Dependent Weighting family is definitely the right direction (as shown by the accepted loss), the exponential decay function is likely too rigid. Try swapping the exponential decay for a power-law decay: `weights = 1.0 / ((ranks + 1.0) ** gamma)` where `gamma` is a parameter (e.g., [0.0, 5.0]). Power-law decay provides a softer drop-off than exponential decay, which should allow the model to better capture the nuanced partial-compensatory behavior seen in Experiments 5 and 6 while maintaining the good fits on Experiments 3 and 4."
