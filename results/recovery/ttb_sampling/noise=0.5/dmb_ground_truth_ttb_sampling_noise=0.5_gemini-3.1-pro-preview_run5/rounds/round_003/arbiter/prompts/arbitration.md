# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_5") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Take The Best (TTB) heuristic posits a lexicographic decision rule where individuals search through features in descending order of validity. They stop at the first feature that discriminates between the two options, choosing the option with the positive value on that feature. If no feature discriminates, they guess randomly. To account for empirical levels of noise, the choice is mixed with a lapse rate (epsilon) that can span up to 1.0 (pure guessing).

## THEORY 2 — pi_5
Take-The-Best with Downstream Tallying Mixture: Decision makers fundamentally rely on a lexicographic heuristic (Take-The-Best), searching through features in descending order of validity. However, to account for corroboration and tie-breaking effects, individuals occasionally mix this strategy with a 'downstream tally'—an equal-weight count of only the remaining, unexamined cues that have lower validity than the discriminating cue. This prevents the discriminating cue from double-contributing to the tally, reducing over-prediction of compensatory WADD-like behavior in environments with highly valid cues, while preserving compensatory variance in environments where downstream cues strongly oppose the best cue.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate pure Take The Best (TTB) from TTB with a Downstream Tallying Mixture, we hold the TTB prediction constant while systematically varying the downstream tally (the equal-weight sum of all unexamined cues lower in validity than the discriminating cue). Pure TTB ignores all cues after the first discriminating one, predicting a constant choice probability across trials where the first discriminating cue is the same. In contrast, the Downstream Tallying Mixture model evaluates the remaining cues. By shifting the downstream tally from heavily favoring the unchosen option to heavily favoring the TTB-chosen option, the mixture model predicts a monotonically increasing choice probability, whereas pure TTB predicts a flat line.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
By comparing the subject's adherence to the Take-The-Best (TTB) prediction on trials where the downstream tally agrees with TTB versus trials where it disagrees, we can isolate the effect of the downstream tally. Under the pure TTB model, adherence should be equal across both types of trials (difference near zero). Under the Downstream Tallying Mixture model, adherence will be significantly higher when the tally agrees and significantly lower when it disagrees, yielding a positive difference.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**

  trial 9: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 10: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates pure Take The Best (TTB) from the TTB + Downstream Tallying Mixture model. We hold the primary TTB prediction constant (by keeping the highest-validity discriminating cue the same) while systematically varying the tally of the remaining, unexamined cues. In trials 1-5, the first cue discriminates, and the downstream tally shifts from strongly favoring Option B to strongly favoring Option A. Pure TTB predicts a constant probability of choosing A across these trials. The mixture model, however, predicts a monotonically increasing probability of choosing A. Trials 6-8 replicate this logic but with the third cue as the discriminating cue, testing whether the downstream tally effect persists when the decision process reaches deeper into the cue hierarchy.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates trials where the discriminating cue consistently favors Option A, but the downstream tally of unexamined cues systematically varies. In the 'high_tally_A' trials, the remaining cues strongly favor Option A, whereas in 'high_tally_B' trials, the remaining cues strongly favor Option B. The pure Take The Best (TTB) model ignores these downstream cues and predicts a constant probability of choosing A across both sets of trials, resulting in a metric value near 0. The TTB + Downstream Tallying Mixture model, however, adjusts its choice probabilities based on the tally of unexamined cues, predicting a higher rate of choosing A in the first set and a lower rate in the second, leading to a significantly positive metric value.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the experiments, Theory 1 (pure Take The Best, pi_3) consistently outperforms Theory 2 (TTB with Downstream Tallying Mixture, pi_5) on experiments specifically designed to isolate downstream and compensatory effects (Experiments 1, 2, 7, and 8). In these experiments, the observed metrics are very close to zero, perfectly aligning with pure TTB's predictions and strongly rejecting the downstream tallying and WADD-like compensatory mechanisms proposed by Theory 2. Theory 2 significantly overpredicts the influence of unexamined cues. While Theory 2 showed slight improvements in Experiments 3, 4, and 5, its massive failures on the highly diagnostic experiments indicate that downstream tallying is not the correct mechanism to explain deviations from TTB. The dominant decision rule is clearly non-compensatory.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a brand-new theory that replaces the Downstream Tallying Mixture. Since the empirical data strongly supports a strict non-compensatory (lexicographic) stopping rule without downstream evaluation, the new theory should maintain TTB as the core mechanism but explore a different source for the observed variance in Experiments 3-5. For example, consider a 'Take-The-Best with Cue-Reading Errors' theory, where decision-makers attempt to execute pure TTB but have a non-zero probability of misreading or misremembering individual cue values, or a 'Probabilistic Cue Validity' model where the subjective order of cues varies slightly across trials due to memory noise, rather than mixing with a compensatory tallying strategy."
