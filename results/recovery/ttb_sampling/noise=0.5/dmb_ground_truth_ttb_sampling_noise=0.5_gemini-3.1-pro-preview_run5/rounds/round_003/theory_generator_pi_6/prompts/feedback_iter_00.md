# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Propose a brand-new theory that replaces the Downstream Tallying Mixture. Since the empirical data strongly supports a strict non-compensatory (lexicographic) stopping rule without downstream evaluation, the new theory should maintain TTB as the core mechanism but explore a different source for the observed variance in Experiments 3-5. For example, consider a 'Take-The-Best with Cue-Reading Errors' theory, where decision-makers attempt to execute pure TTB but have a non-zero probability of misreading or misremembering individual cue values, or a 'Probabilistic Cue Validity' model where the subjective order of cues varies slightly across trials due to memory noise, rather than mixing with a compensatory tallying strategy.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Probabilistic Cue Validity (Take-The-Best with Memory Noise): Decision-makers fundamentally use a non-compensatory lexicographic strategy (Take-The-Best), but the subjective validities of cues vary slightly from trial to trial due to memory noise or retrieval fluctuations. Instead of mixing TTB with a compensatory tallying strategy, this theory posits that variations in cue order allow options with more positive cues (which would be favored by tallying) to occasionally win, because having more positive cues increases the statistical likelihood that one of those cues will temporarily fluctuate to the top of the subjective validity hierarchy. This preserves the core non-compensatory mechanism while elegantly explaining variance in environments with multiple opposing cues.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    sigma = float(parameters["sigma"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    n_samples = 200
    if sigma > 0:
        noise = np.random.normal(0, sigma, size=(n_samples, len(validities)))
        subj_vals = validities + noise
    else:
        subj_vals = np.tile(validities, (n_samples, 1))
        
    # Sort cues by subjective validities descending
    orders = np.argsort(subj_vals, axis=1)[:, ::-1]
    
    p_a = 0.0
    for i in range(n_samples):
        order = orders[i]
        for idx in order:
            if a[idx] > b[idx]:
                p_a += 1.0
                break
            elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
                break
        else:
            p_a += 0.5
            
    p_a /= n_samples
    p_core = np.array([p_a, 1.0 - p_a])
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- sigma: [0.0, 0.5]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory discards the Downstream Tallying Mixture and replaces it with Probabilistic Cue Validity. The empirical data strongly favors pure TTB over compensatory mixtures in Experiments 5-8, but pure TTB struggles with the variance in Experiments 1-4. By introducing memory noise (sigma) to the cue validities, the subjective order of cues fluctuates across trials. Options with a higher tally of positive cues naturally have a statistically higher chance of having one of their positive cues jump to the top of the hierarchy. This produces tally-like behavior probabilistically without ever calculating a compensatory sum, aligning perfectly with the observed data while maintaining a strict non-compensatory stopping rule on every individual trial.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2594 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2594.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate model successfully implemented the Probabilistic Cue Validity (Memory Noise) mechanism, replacing the Downstream Tallying Mixture. The model was ACCEPTED by the gate, meaning it improved over the prior baseline. However, looking closely at the experiment-level metrics, the model overestimates compensatory behavior in Experiments 5 through 8. The observed data for these experiments are all very close to 0 (Exp 5: -0.005, Exp 6: -0.002, Exp 7: 0.052, Exp 8: 0.024), indicating that human subjects exhibit almost pure Take-The-Best behavior and are rarely swayed by downstream tallies. The candidate simulates values between 0.18 and 0.32 for these metrics. This happens because the `sigma` parameter (up to 0.5) frequently causes lower-ranked cues to jump above the most valid cue, essentially mimicking a compensatory tallying strategy too strongly.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The Probabilistic Cue Validity mechanism is a solid in-family direction and was accepted by the gate, but it currently produces too much cue-reordering. To align better with the near-zero compensatory effects observed in Experiments 5-8, the noise injected into the subjective validities must be smaller. Revise the parameter range for `sigma` to be much tighter (e.g., [0.0, 0.15] instead of [0.0, 0.5]). Alternatively, you could implement the noise as a softmax over validities (with a high inverse temperature) to select the first cue, ensuring the highest-validity cue is still chosen the vast majority of the time. Keep the core theory intact but tune the noise calibration so it doesn't overpower the strict non-compensatory nature of the data."
