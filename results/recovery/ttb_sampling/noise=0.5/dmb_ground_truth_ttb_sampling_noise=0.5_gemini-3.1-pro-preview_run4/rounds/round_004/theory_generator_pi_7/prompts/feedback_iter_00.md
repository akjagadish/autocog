# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Propose a 'Rank-Dependent Integration' or 'Sequential Search with Evidence Decay' theory. In this theory, decision-makers process features in order of validity (like TTB), but instead of a strict stopping rule, they accumulate evidence across features with a steep rank-based discount. Furthermore, processing additional features incurs a cognitive cost or introduces noise, which can slightly degrade the accumulated evidence of the leading option. This would naturally capture the strong TTB-like behavior in Exp 1, while allowing for the mild dilution/conflict effects seen in Exp 2 and Exp 9 when many low-validity features are added.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Rank-Dependent Integration with Evidence Decay: Decision-makers process features in order of their validity, accumulating evidence for each option. However, the weight of each feature decays steeply based on its rank (e.g., exponential decay). Furthermore, processing each additional feature incurs a cognitive cost or introduces noise, modeled as a constant penalty subtracted from the feature's weight. This penalty naturally captures the 'dilution effect', where adding numerous low-validity features can actually degrade an option's overall evidence, leading to strong Take-The-Best (TTB) like behavior in some contexts while still allowing for compensatory integration when high-validity cues are close.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]

    c = float(parameters["c"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Sort features by validity descending to get their ranks
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    ranks = np.empty_like(order)
    ranks[order] = np.arange(len(order))
    
    # Calculate rank-dependent weights with cognitive cost penalty
    # The highest validity feature (rank 0) gets weight 1.0 - c
    weights = (gamma ** ranks) - c
    
    # Accumulate evidence
    score_a = np.sum(a * weights)
    score_b = np.sum(b * weights)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Convert to probabilities via softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    p_core = np.exp(z) / np.sum(np.exp(z))
    
    # Apply lapse rate
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    p_final = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
    
    return p_final


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.1, 0.99]
- c: [0.0, 0.5]
- beta: [0.1, 25.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
This theory implements the arbiter's suggestion of 'Rank-Dependent Integration' with evidence decay. By weighting features as `gamma^rank - c`, the model applies a steep rank-based discount (`gamma`) while also penalizing each positive feature with a cognitive cost (`c`). This penalty `c` is crucial: it means that low-validity features (where `gamma^rank < c`) actually *detract* from an option's accumulated evidence. This elegantly captures the 'dilution effect' seen in Experiments 8 and 10, where adding many low-validity backup features hurts an option's choice probability. Furthermore, it naturally shifts a compensatory WADD-like process into a non-compensatory TTB-like process when one option has a single high-validity feature and the other has many low-validity features (since the latter accumulates multiple penalties), successfully explaining the strong TTB adherence in Experiments 1 and 3 without needing a discrete stopping rule or strategy mixture.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1302 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1302.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate theory 'Rank-Dependent Integration with Evidence Decay' performs exceptionally well across the suite of experiments, achieving a low aggregate loss. It successfully captures the strong TTB-like behavior in Experiments 3 and 4, while simultaneously explaining the dilution effect observed in Experiment 10 (where the addition of low-validity features hurts the option). The introduction of a constant cognitive cost 'c' subtracted from the rank-discounted weights perfectly aligns with the arbiter's recommendation and elegantly bridges compensatory and non-compensatory choice patterns.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate was accepted by the gate and provides a strong, unified account of the data. It accurately captures the nuanced interaction between high-validity cues and the diluting effect of multiple low-validity cues (e.g., Exp 9 and Exp 10). The parameter ranges and policy formulation are robust, so we can ship this theory as a successful instantiation of the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family."
