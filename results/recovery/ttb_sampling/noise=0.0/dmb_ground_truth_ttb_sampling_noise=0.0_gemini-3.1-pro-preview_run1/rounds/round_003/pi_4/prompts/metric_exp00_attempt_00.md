# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.92, 0.89, 0.86, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design specifically targets the dissociation between standard Take-The-Best (TTB) and Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB) by manipulating the validity distance between the best discriminating cue and the next best cues. Standard TTB predicts a constant choice probability (1 - epsilon) for the option favored by the highest-validity discriminating cue, regardless of how close the next-best cue's validity is. In contrast, PTTB adds trial-by-trial noise to validities before sorting, meaning rank inversions are highly likely for cues with similar validities but exceedingly rare for cues with disparate validities. By pairing validities that are tightly clustered (e.g., 0.92, 0.89, 0.86) with those that are distant (0.65, 0.55), we create 'small gap' trials where PTTB predicts a much softer preference than TTB, and 'large gap' trials where PTTB and TTB both predict strong preferences.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB) with Softmax Smoothing: Subjects use a non-compensatory lexicographic search to choose between options, but their subjective representation of cue validities is subject to slight trial-by-trial noise. The cue hierarchy is determined by sorting the noisy validities. This causes occasional inversions in the search order (especially for cues with similar validities). Instead of a uniform lapse rate, the resulting deterministic choices are smoothed via a softmax function with a temperature parameter, allowing for a consistent baseline deviation from strict TTB without over-penalizing high-confidence predictions.

**Parameters:**
- sigma: [0.0, 0.1]
- temperature: [0.1, 1.0]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"PTTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    sigma = float(parameters["sigma"])
    temperature = float(parameters["temperature"])
    
    n_samples = 100
    p_core = np.zeros(2)
    
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        # Add Gaussian noise to the validities to simulate subjective trial-by-trial hierarchy
        noisy_v = validities + np.random.normal(0, sigma, size=len(validities))
        order = np.argsort(noisy_v)[::-1]
        
        chosen = -1
        for idx in order:
            if a[idx] > b[idx]:
                chosen = 0
                break
            elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
                chosen = 1
                break
                
        if chosen == 0:
            p_core[0] += 1.0
        elif chosen == 1:
            p_core[1] += 1.0
        else:
            p_core += 0.5
            
    p_core /= n_samples
    
    # Apply softmax with temperature to the core probabilities for smoother deviation
    z = p_core / temperature
    z = z - np.max(z)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum()
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People use a non-compensatory, lexicographic heuristic called 'Take The Best' (TTB) to choose between options. They search through features in descending order of their subjective validity and stop at the first feature that discriminates between the two options (i.e., one option has a positive rating and the other does not). The choice is based entirely on this single discriminating cue, completely ignoring all remaining features, regardless of how many lower-validity cues might favor the alternative.

**Parameters:**
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    chosen = -1
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            chosen = 0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            chosen = 1
            break
            
    # Deterministic choice based on the first discriminating cue
    if chosen == 0:
        p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif chosen == 1:
        p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        # If all features tie, guess randomly
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    
    # Blend deterministic choice with uniform lapse rate for noise
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "Under standard Take-The-Best (TTB), the choice on both Trial 1 and Trial 2 is completely determined by the first cue (validity 0.92), which favors option A in both cases. Therefore, TTB predicts an identical probability of choosing Option B on both trials (just the uniform lapse rate), making the difference 0. Under Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB), the noise in validities frequently causes the second and third cues (validities 0.89, 0.86) to temporarily outrank the first. In Trial 1, these cues strongly favor B, leading to a high rate of choosing B. In Trial 2, these cues do not favor B, so A is still chosen. Thus, PTTB predicts a significantly higher rate of choosing B in Trial 1 compared to Trial 2, resulting in a large positive metric."
