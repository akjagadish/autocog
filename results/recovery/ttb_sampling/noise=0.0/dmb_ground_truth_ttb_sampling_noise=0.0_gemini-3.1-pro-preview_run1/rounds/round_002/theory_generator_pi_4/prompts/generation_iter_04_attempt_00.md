# generation_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2_1`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2_1`).

Theory 2 (WADD) is degenerate for this experimental paradigm and should be replaced. Since TTB (Theory 1) explains the data very well, propose a new theory that acts as a stronger, non-compensatory or semi-compensatory competitor. For example, propose a 'Take-Two' heuristic (where subjects consider only the top two valid cues and guess if they conflict) or a 'Probabilistic TTB' (where the hierarchy of cues is subject to noise, meaning subjects occasionally evaluate cues out of strict validity order). Avoid simple Tallying, as Experiments 3-5 already indicate subjects do not simply count features.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.992)

**Description**
People use a non-compensatory, lexicographic heuristic called 'Take The Best' (TTB) to choose between options. They search through features in descending order of their subjective validity and stop at the first feature that discriminates between the two options (i.e., one option has a positive rating and the other does not). The choice is based entirely on this single discriminating cue, completely ignoring all remaining features, regardless of how many lower-validity cues might favor the alternative.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.444)

**Description**
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.3434 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1233 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1363 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.1189 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 4 at loss=0.1189 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB) with Softmax Smoothing: Subjects use a non-compensatory lexicographic search to choose between options, but their subjective representation of cue validities is subject to slight trial-by-trial noise. The cue hierarchy is determined by sorting the noisy validities. This causes occasional inversions in the search order (especially for cues with similar validities). Instead of a uniform lapse rate, the resulting deterministic choices are smoothed via a softmax function with a temperature parameter, allowing for a consistent baseline deviation from strict TTB without over-penalizing high-confidence predictions.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"PTTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    sigma = float(parameters["sigma"])
    temperature = float(parameters["temperature"])
    
    n_samples = 100
    p_core = np.zeros(2)
    
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        # Add Gaussian noise to the validities to simulate subjective trial-by-trial hierarchy
        noisy_v = validities + np.random.normal(0, sigma, size=len(validities))
        order = np.argsort(noisy_v)[::-1]
        
        chosen = -1
        for idx in order:
            if a[idx] > b[idx]:
                chosen = 0
                break
            elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
                chosen = 1
                break
                
        if chosen == 0:
            p_core[0] += 1.0
        elif chosen == 1:
            p_core[1] += 1.0
        else:
            p_core += 0.5
            
    p_core /= n_samples
    
    # Apply softmax with temperature to the core probabilities for smoother deviation
    z = p_core / temperature
    z = z - np.max(z)
    e = np.exp(z)
    return e / e.sum()


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- sigma: [0.0, 0.3]
- temperature: [0.1, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Reverted `sigma` back to the successful `[0.0, 0.3]` range from Iteration 2, and replaced the uniform lapse rate `epsilon` with a `temperature` parameter in `[0.1, 1.0]`. Applying a softmax over the sampled probabilities provides a smoother, scaled deviation from strict TTB, naturally capturing the ~10-15% deviation seen in Experiments 1-4 without becoming overly deterministic like the rejected Iteration 3.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the Arbiter's suggested Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB) model. However, looking at the simulated values across all 6 experiments, the model consistently predicts values near 0.4-0.5, whereas the human data shows highly deterministic, extreme behavior (e.g., 0.13, 0.83, 0.15). The current parameter ranges for the noise mechanisms are washing out the core lexicographic choices, pulling the predictions too strongly toward random guessing.
Rationale: The Probabilistic TTB mechanism is a great choice and was accepted by the gate, but the parameter ranges for the noise terms are too wide. With `sigma` up to 1.0 and `epsilon` up to 0.5, the model frequently scrambles the cue hierarchy entirely and adds massive lapse noise. To capture the strong TTB-like human behavior while still allowing for slight probabilistic deviations, tighten the parameter bounds: reduce `sigma` to [0.0, 0.3] and `epsilon` to [0.0, 0.1]. Keep the core mechanism exactly the same.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3434 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1233 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate followed the previous advice to tighten the noise parameters, resulting in a massive improvement in aggregate loss (from 0.34 to 0.12). The model now closely tracks human behavior in Experiments 1-4. However, in Experiment 5, the model still noticeably underpredicts the proportion of TTB-consistent choices (0.5775 vs human 0.8375), and in Experiment 6 it overpredicts slightly (0.2875 vs human 0.1500). This indicates that the subjective cue hierarchy is still experiencing slightly too many inversions due to the noise parameter `sigma`.
Rationale: The previous advice to tighten the noise bounds was highly successful and accepted by the gate. To bridge the remaining gap in Experiments 5 and 6, push slightly further in the exact same direction: reduce the upper bound of `sigma` to 0.15 and `epsilon` to 0.05. This will preserve the probabilistic nature of the model but allow it to reach the ~0.84 consistency seen in Experiment 5. Keep the core PTTB mechanism unchanged.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1233 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1363 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate's attempt to further tighten the noise parameters (sigma to 0.15, epsilon to 0.05) was REJECTED by the gate because it made the model too deterministic. While it improved the fit for Experiment 5 (moving from 0.57 to 0.68) and Experiment 6, it severely degraded the fit on Experiments 1-4. For example, in Experiment 1, the prediction dropped to 0.0156 compared to the human data's 0.1311. The human data shows a consistent ~10-15% deviation from strict TTB in these early experiments, which the overly tightened model can no longer capture.
Rationale: The previous advice to shrink the parameter bounds overshot the mark and was rejected by the gate. We need to restore the balance between deterministic TTB behavior and probabilistic deviation. Instead of tweaking the uniform lapse rate `epsilon`, change the choice mechanism to be smoother: replace `epsilon` with a `temperature` parameter (range [0.1, 1.0]) and apply a softmax function to the `p_core` values before returning them. Revert `sigma` to the successful iteration 2 bounds of [0.0, 0.3]. This will allow the model to capture the 10-15% deviation in Exps 1-4 via temperature-scaled probabilistic choice, while still maintaining the core PTTB hierarchy.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1363 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.1189 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The introduction of softmax smoothing over the sampled probabilities was highly successful, leading to the best aggregate loss yet (0.1189). The model now perfectly captures the ~10-15% deviation from strict TTB seen in Experiments 1-4. However, the performance on Experiments 5 and 6 has degraded compared to Iteration 2. In Experiment 5, the model predicts 0.5288 (vs human 0.8375), and in Experiment 6 it predicts 0.3538 (vs human 0.1500). Because `p_core` values are bounded between 0 and 1, applying a softmax with a temperature up to 1.0 heavily dampens the predictions, capping the maximum choice probability at around 0.73. This over-smoothing is washing out the strong TTB-consistent choices required in Experiments 5 and 6.
Rationale: The softmax smoothing mechanism is the right approach and was accepted by the gate, but the current temperature range [0.1, 1.0] forces too much smoothing on inputs that only span [0, 1]. To allow the model to reach the highly deterministic ~84% consistency in Experiment 5 while retaining the ability to smooth to ~15% deviation in Exps 1-4, lower the temperature parameter bounds. Change the `temperature` range to [0.01, 0.5]. Keep the core PTTB mechanism and the `sigma` range [0.0, 0.3] exactly as they are.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.1189 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

Lowering the bounds allows the model to reach the ~84% consistency in Experiment 5 while still retaining the ability to smooth to ~15% deviation in Exps 1-4."
