# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2_1` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, we increased the upper bound of the `beta` range to 50.0 (from 20.0) and further restricted the `epsilon` range to [0.0, 0.05] (from [0.0, 0.1]). This allows the model to produce even more deterministic choices, better matching the extreme behavior observed in the human data while leaving the core WADD mechanism intact.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.05]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson 1993).
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current trial:
    # array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B.
    # Each option's score is the dot product of its feature vector with the
    # subjective validity weights (which are given directly by the experiment).
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with validities directly)
    scores = stim @ validities

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

## Replacement

### `pi_3` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** People use a non-compensatory, lexicographic heuristic called 'Take The Best' (TTB) to choose between options. They search through features in descending order of their subjective validity and stop at the first feature that discriminates between the two options (i.e., one option has a positive rating and the other does not). The choice is based entirely on this single discriminating cue, completely ignoring all remaining features, regardless of how many lower-validity cues might favor the alternative.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's recommendation, this model implements the 'Take The Best' (TTB) heuristic. Unlike Tallying (which ignores validities) and WADD (which integrates all validities in a compensatory manner), TTB is a non-compensatory lexicographic strategy. It searches features in descending order of validity and makes a decision based solely on the first discriminating cue. This directly tests whether subjects are relying on single high-validity cues rather than integrating all available information. Response noise is handled via a uniform lapse rate (epsilon) applied to the deterministic TTB choice.

**Parameters:**
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    chosen = -1
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            chosen = 0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            chosen = 1
            break
            
    # Deterministic choice based on the first discriminating cue
    if chosen == 0:
        p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif chosen == 1:
        p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        # If all features tie, guess randomly
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    
    # Blend deterministic choice with uniform lapse rate for noise
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```
