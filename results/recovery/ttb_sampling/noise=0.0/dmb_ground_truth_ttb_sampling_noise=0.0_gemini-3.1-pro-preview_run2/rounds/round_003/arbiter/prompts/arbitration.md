# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_5") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Take The Best (TTB) Heuristic: Decision makers use a non-compensatory, lexicographic strategy to choose between options. They search through cues in descending order of subjective validity (or informativeness). The first cue that discriminates between the two options strictly determines the choice, and all remaining lower-validity cues are ignored. If no cues discriminate, the decision maker guesses. Response noise is modeled as a uniform lapse.

## THEORY 2 — pi_5
Take The Best with Validity-Dependent Confidence: Decision makers use a non-compensatory, lexicographic strategy (Take The Best) to choose between options. However, their execution of this strategy is noisy, and the degree of noise (lapse rate) depends on the validity of the discriminating cue. When options are discriminated by a highly valid cue, confidence is high and the lapse rate is low. When the discriminating cue has low validity, confidence is lower, leading to a higher probability of guessing or lapsing. This maintains the non-compensatory nature of TTB while naturally explaining variations in performance across different trial structures.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate pure Take The Best (TTB) from TTB with Validity-Dependent Confidence, we systematically vary the validity of the highest discriminating cue across trials. Pure TTB assumes a constant lapse rate and predicts equal choice probabilities for the TTB-favored option regardless of which cue discriminates. In contrast, the Validity-Dependent Confidence model assumes that the lapse rate increases when the discriminating cue has lower validity. By tying the highest validity cues and forcing the decision onto progressively lower-validity cues across different trials, we expect pure TTB to maintain a flat accuracy curve, while the competing theory predicts a monotonically decreasing accuracy curve for the TTB-favored option.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The pure Take The Best (TTB) model predicts a constant error rate (lapse rate) regardless of which cue discriminates between the two options. The competing 'Validity-Dependent Confidence' model predicts that as the discriminating cue becomes less valid, the lapse rate increases. This metric isolates trials where the decision relies on highly valid cues (the top 2 cues) versus low validity cues (the bottom 2 cues) and computes the difference in the rate at which subjects choose the TTB-favored option. TTB predicts this difference should be near 0, while the competing theory predicts it should be distinctly positive.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate pure Take The Best (TTB) from TTB with Validity-Dependent Confidence (TTB-VDC), we must manipulate the validity of the highest discriminating cue across trials. Pure TTB assumes a constant lapse rate regardless of which cue breaks the tie, predicting a flat probability of choosing the TTB-favored option across these trials. In contrast, TTB-VDC posits that confidence scales with the validity of the discriminating cue, predicting that the lapse rate will parametrically increase (and accuracy decrease) as the decision is forced onto lower-validity cues. By systematically tying the upper cues and allowing progressively lower-validity cues to discriminate, we can observe whether choice consistency degrades in a validity-dependent manner.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design systematically varies the index of the highest discriminating cue across trials, while keeping option A as the TTB-favored choice. The advocated theory (TTB-VDC) posits that as the decision relies on lower-validity cues, confidence decreases and the lapse rate increases. Therefore, accuracy relative to the TTB prediction should drop for trials where the discriminating cue is low-validity (cues 3 and 4) compared to high-validity (cues 0 and 1). The competing theory (pure TTB) assumes a constant lapse rate across all trials, predicting a difference of approximately zero. This metric directly calculates the difference in choice consistency between high-validity and low-validity discriminating cues.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across Experiments 1 and 2, the observed data strongly contradicts THEORY 2 (Take The Best with Validity-Dependent Confidence). The observed metric values in both experiments are near zero, indicating that subjects' choice consistency does not degrade when decisions are forced onto lower-validity cues. This flat accuracy curve is perfectly predicted by pure TTB (THEORY 1), which assumes a constant lapse rate regardless of the discriminating cue. THEORY 2 predicted a large positive difference (0.125 to 0.147) that did not materialize. While pure TTB is an excellent fit for the data overall, there are slight deviations in other experiments (e.g., Experiments 3, 4, 7, and 8) suggesting that a pure lexicographic rule with uniform noise might not capture all variance, possibly missing a small compensatory component.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Replace THEORY 2 with a 'Mixture of TTB and Tallying' theory. The validity-dependent confidence hypothesis is falsified by Experiments 1 and 2, as lapse rates do not scale with the validity of the discriminating cue. Instead, propose a theory where decision-makers probabilistically alternate between a strict non-compensatory strategy (Take The Best) and a simple compensatory strategy (Tallying, which counts the total number of cues favoring each option regardless of validity). This mixture model can maintain the strong TTB baseline that fits the flat accuracy curves in Exps 1 and 2, while potentially capturing the small deviations in choice probabilities observed in experiments where TTB and Tallying conflict."
