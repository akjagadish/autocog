## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended heuristics (e.g. TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every heuristic agrees, and prefer pairs that dissociate single-feature focus from feature-summing strategies. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities
- weights: [(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Take The Best (TTB) Heuristic: Decision makers use a non-compensatory, lexicographic strategy to choose between options. They search through cues in descending order of subjective validity (or informativeness). The first cue that discriminates between the two options strictly determines the choice, and all remaining lower-validity cues are ignored. If no cues discriminate, the decision maker guesses. Response noise is modeled as a uniform lapse.

**Parameters:**
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort cues in descending order of validity. 
    # We use a stable sort so that if validities are tied, left-to-right order is preserved.
    order = np.argsort(-validities, kind='stable')
    
    # Default to guessing if no cues discriminate
    p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    
    # Lexicographic search
    for i in order:
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[i] > a[i]:
            p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=float)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] This design leverages the core difference between Tallying (which counts the number of features where an option is superior, ignoring validities) and WADD (which computes a validity-weighted sum). By using 5 features with a steep validity drop-off, we can construct trials where Option A wins on a larger number of low-validity features (favored by Tallying) while Option B wins on fewer but much higher-validity features (favored by WADD). We also include trials where Tallying predicts a perfect tie (equal number of winning features) but WADD strongly prefers one option, and baseline trials where both models agree.

[1] To strongly dissociate WADD from Tallying, this design uses 5 features with a steep drop-off in validities. We construct trials where one option wins on a larger number of low-validity features (favored by Tallying) while the other option wins on fewer but higher-validity features (favored by WADD). We also include tie-breaking trials where both options win on an equal number of features (Tallying predicts guessing) but WADD strongly prefers the option with the higher-validity features. Finally, baseline trials where both models agree are included to ensure general task engagement.

[2] To dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule, this design exploits TTB's non-compensatory, lexicographic nature. We use 5 features with descending validities. In the critical trials, one option is favored by the single highest-validity discriminating feature (which TTB relies on exclusively), while the other option is favored by all remaining lower-validity features. For WADD, the combined weight of these multiple lower-validity features overcomes the single best feature, leading to opposite predictions. We also include trials where the highest validities are tied, forcing TTB to the next cue, while WADD still compensates with the remaining cues. Baseline agreement trials are included to ensure general task engagement.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — heuristics that rely on validity-ordering re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) collapse WADD into a scaled Equal-Weight rule and make them indistinguishable by any decision.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended heuristics (TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) be dissociated; avoid trials where every heuristic agrees.


## Response

{
  "rationale": "To cleanly dissociate the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule from the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic, we use a set of 5 features with linearly decreasing validities. The critical trials are designed such that the single most valid discriminating cue favors one option (which TTB will categorically choose), while a combination of several lower-validity cues favors the other option strongly enough to override the single best cue in a compensatory model like WADD. We also include trials where WADD predicts a tie but TTB predicts a strict preference, and baseline trials where both models agree.
