# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Take The Best (TTB) Heuristic: Decision makers use a non-compensatory, lexicographic strategy to choose between options. They search through cues in descending order of subjective validity (or informativeness). The first cue that discriminates between the two options strictly determines the choice, and all remaining lower-validity cues are ignored. If no cues discriminate, the decision maker guesses. Response noise is modeled as a uniform lapse.

    # We use a stable sort so that if validities are tied, left-to-right order is preserved.
    order = np.argsort(-validities, kind='stable')

    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=float)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 10: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule, this design exploits TTB's non-compensatory, lexicographic nature. We use 5 features with descending validities. In the critical trials, one option is favored by the single highest-validity discriminating feature (which TTB relies on exclusively), while the other option is favored by all remaining lower-validity features. For WADD, the combined weight of these multiple lower-validity features overcomes the single best feature, leading to opposite predictions. We also include trials where the highest validities are tied, forcing TTB to the next cue, while WADD still compensates with the remaining cues. Baseline agreement trials are included to ensure general task engagement.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of trials where the subject's choice matches the prediction of the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic. The experimental design is specifically constructed so that on 80% of the trials, the highest-validity discriminating feature points to one option, while the sum of all remaining lower-validity features points to the other option. Consequently, the TTB model will have a very high match rate with its own predictions (bounded only by response noise), whereas the Weighted Additive (WADD) model, which evaluates options compensatorily, will systematically choose the opposite option on these critical trials, resulting in a substantially lower match rate.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN

**Trial pairs (n=12):**

  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

  trial 9: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 11: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 12: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To cleanly dissociate the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule from the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic, we use a set of 5 features with linearly decreasing validities. The critical trials are designed such that the single most valid discriminating cue favors one option (which TTB will categorically choose), while a combination of several lower-validity cues favors the other option strongly enough to override the single best cue in a compensatory model like WADD. We also include trials where WADD predicts a tie but TTB predicts a strict preference, and baseline trials where both models agree. This provides a robust quantitative dissociation of compensatory vs. non-compensatory feature integration.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic's prediction. TTB strictly chooses the option favored by the single most valid discriminating cue. In contrast, the Weighted Additive (WADD) model is compensatory and will often choose the option favored by a combination of lower-validity cues, even if it loses on the single best cue. Therefore, TTB adherence will be significantly lower for WADD-simulated data compared to TTB-simulated data.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all four experiments, THEORY 1 (Take The Best) provides an exceptionally tight fit to the observed data, whereas THEORY 2 (Weighted Additive) consistently fails. The data reveals highly non-compensatory choice patterns: subjects reliably choose the option favored by the single most valid discriminating cue, even when the alternative is favored by a multitude of lower-validity cues. Because THEORY 2's compensatory mechanism completely mispredicts these critical trials (often predicting choices near 50% or in the opposite direction), it is degenerate in this experimental context. Since THEORY 1 is already very successful, we should discard THEORY 2 and propose a new, stronger competitor theory that builds upon the success of non-compensatory heuristics.",

  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Strategy Selection' or 'Probabilistic Cue Search' model. While Take The Best (THEORY 1) assumes a perfectly deterministic lexicographic cue search based on objective validities, a stronger competitor might assume that decision-makers use a probabilistic cue search (e.g., sampling cues proportional to their validities) or a mixture model where individuals probabilistically switch between a lexicographic heuristic (TTB) and a simple compensatory heuristic like Tallying (Equal Weight) depending on cognitive load or cue dispersion. This provides a nuanced alternative to pure TTB without reverting to the fully compensatory WADD model."
