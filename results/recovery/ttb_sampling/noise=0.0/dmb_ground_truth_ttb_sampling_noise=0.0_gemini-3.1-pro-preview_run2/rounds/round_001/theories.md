# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Take The Best (TTB) Heuristic: Decision makers use a non-compensatory, lexicographic strategy to choose between options. They search through cues in descending order of subjective validity (or informativeness). The first cue that discriminates between the two options strictly determines the choice, and all remaining lower-validity cues are ignored. If no cues discriminate, the decision maker guesses. Response noise is modeled as a uniform lapse.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory replaces the compensatory Tallying mechanism with the 'Take The Best' (TTB) heuristic. Instead of counting total feature wins, TTB assumes a non-compensatory lexicographic search: subjects evaluate cues in descending order of validity and make their choice based entirely on the first cue that discriminates between the options. This directly captures the subjects' strong preference for the option that wins on the most valid feature, resolving Tallying's inverse predictions on the key diagnostic trials. A lapse rate (epsilon) is included to account for execution errors or guessing.

**Parameters:**
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort cues in descending order of validity. 
    # We use a stable sort so that if validities are tied, left-to-right order is preserved.
    order = np.argsort(-validities, kind='stable')
    
    # Default to guessing if no cues discriminate
    p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    
    # Lexicographic search
    for i in order:
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[i] > a[i]:
            p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=float)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Strategy Selection: Decision makers probabilistically switch between a lexicographic heuristic (Take The Best) and a simple compensatory heuristic (Tallying). On any given trial, an individual predominantly uses TTB (with high probability p_ttb) but occasionally lapses into Tallying, reflecting a mixture of non-compensatory and compensatory decision strategies driven by individual differences or cognitive load.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the parameter ranges for the Strategy Selection model have been tightened. By restricting `p_ttb` to `[0.7, 1.0]` and `epsilon` to `[0.0, 0.1]`, the model is forced to predominantly rely on the Take The Best heuristic, which aligns better with the robust lexicographic behavior observed in the empirical data, while still allowing for occasional compensatory Tallying behavior.

**Parameters:**
  - `p_ttb`: `[0.7, 1.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.1]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
