# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Theory 2 (PTTB) is degenerate and fails to capture the deterministic nature of feature-based choices observed in the data. Propose a brand-new theory, such as a 'Mixture of TTB and Tallying' or 'Take-Two' model. For instance, a mixture model would posit that while the majority of decision-making is driven by the pure deterministic TTB heuristic, a subset of trials or subjects rely on a compensatory Tallying strategy (simply counting the number of positive features for each option). This would maintain the strong non-compensatory baseline of TTB while providing a more realistic structural alternative to pure uniform lapses (epsilon) for the remaining variance.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Mixture of Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying: Decision-makers primarily rely on the deterministic, non-compensatory Take-The-Best heuristic, sequentially checking features ordered by validity and stopping at the first discriminating feature. However, to account for structural behavioral variance beyond uniform guessing, a subset of decisions (or subjects) relies on a compensatory Tallying strategy, which simply counts the number of positive features for each option and chooses the one with the higher count. This maintains the strong baseline of TTB while providing a cognitively plausible mechanism for deviations.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w_tally = float(parameters["w_tally"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # TTB Strategy
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    p_ttb = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    # Tallying Strategy
    sum_a = np.sum(a)
    sum_b = np.sum(b)
    if sum_a > sum_b:
        p_tal = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif sum_b > sum_a:
        p_tal = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        p_tal = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    # Mixture of TTB and Tallying
    p_core = (1.0 - w_tally) * p_ttb + w_tally * p_tal
    
    # Uniform lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs)


`parameters`:
- w_tally: [0.0, 0.5]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.25]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's recommendation, this model replaces the degenerate probabilistic feature search (PTTB) with a deterministic mixture model. It combines the highly successful Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic with a Tallying strategy. This ensures that the core behavior remains strongly non-compensatory (capturing Experiment 7's deterministic TTB adherence), while substituting pure uniform lapses with a structured compensatory alternative (Tallying) that counts features. This mixture better explains systematic deviations from TTB without degrading the overall fit.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3076 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3076.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate model successfully implemented the arbiter's suggested Mixture of TTB and Tallying and beat the baseline, leading to its acceptance. However, it severely fails on Experiment 7 (0.0 vs 1.0) and Experiment 8 (0.27 vs -0.0033). Experiment 7 requires overall TTB adherence to be very high (>85%), which the current high upper bound for `w_tally` (up to 0.5) violates. More importantly, Experiment 8 shows that human TTB adherence does not increase when 3 features favor the choice compared to 1 feature (difference is ~0). By mixing in Tallying too heavily, the model introduces a compensatory effect where the sheer number of features influences the choice, strongly violating the Ex 8 data.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "While the mixture model is a good structural step, the compensatory nature of Tallying breaks the strict non-compensatory empirical patterns when weighted too heavily. Please restrict the `w_tally` parameter to a much smaller range (e.g., [0.0, 0.15]) so that TTB remains overwhelmingly dominant, allowing the model to clear the 85% adherence threshold in Ex 7 and minimizing the spurious 3-vs-1 feature effect in Ex 8. Alternatively, you may pivot to a 'Take-Two' non-compensatory heuristic as the mixture component, which avoids counting all features entirely."
