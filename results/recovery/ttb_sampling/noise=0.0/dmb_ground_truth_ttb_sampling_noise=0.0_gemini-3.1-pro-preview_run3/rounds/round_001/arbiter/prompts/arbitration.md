# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2_1") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2_1" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2_1
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=12):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 11: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 12: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design strictly dissociates Tallying from WADD. Tallying relies exclusively on the number of features where one option beats the other, completely ignoring cardinal validities. WADD, in contrast, computes a validity-weighted sum. By using a 5-feature design with a steep drop-off in validities (two highly valid features and three lower-validity features), we can construct critical trials where Option A wins on more features (e.g., 3 wins vs 2 wins) but Option B wins on the higher-validity features. In these cases, Tallying predicts Option A while WADD predicts Option B. We also include agreement trials and ties to thoroughly span the decision space and ensure robust model recovery.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates 'conflict trials' where Tallying and WADD (assuming a baseline gamma=1) make strictly opposing predictions. For example, when one option wins on more total features (favored by Tallying) but the other option wins on the higher-validity features (favored by WADD). The metric calculates the proportion of choices on these conflict trials that align with the Tallying prediction. Under the Tallying theory, this proportion will be high (close to 1, minus noise); under WADD, it will be low (close to 0, plus noise).

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.55, 0.5, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To strongly dissociate WADD from Tallying, we use a 5-feature design with a sharp drop-off in validities between the top two and the bottom three features. Tallying simply counts the number of features on which an option wins, while WADD computes a validity-weighted sum. By pitting the two high-validity features against the three low-validity features, we create critical trials where Option A wins on fewer but highly valid features, leading WADD to predict Option A while Tallying (counting more wins for Option B) predicts Option B. We also include trials where both models agree, as well as trials where Tallying produces a tie but WADD has a strong preference, ensuring robust parameter recovery and model dissociation.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Measures the proportion of trials where the subject chooses the option with a positive rating on the most valid feature (feature 0), out of all trials where the two options differ on this feature. Tallying ignores feature validities and simply counts total wins, which in this specific experimental design leads it to choose against feature 0 on 5 out of 8 critical trials (yielding a baseline rate of 37.5%, pulled towards 50% by noise). WADD, on the other hand, weights feature 0 heavily due to its high validity, leading to a much higher rate of choosing the option that wins on feature 0 (approaching 100% for larger values of gamma).

    if len(f0_vals) == 0:

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json

  "interpretation": "Across all four experiments, WADD (THEORY 2) consistently and accurately predicts the observed behavior, whereas Tallying (THEORY 1) fails completely. The observed data clearly demonstrates that participants strongly weight cues by their validities: they consistently choose options favored by fewer, but more valid features (as evidenced by the low tally-alignment in Exp 1 and the high feature-0 reliance in Exp 2, 3, and 4). Tallying ignores validities entirely, making it fundamentally degenerate for this dataset. Because WADD performs very well, we should retain it and replace Tallying with a stronger, validity-sensitive competitor.",

  "recommendation": "Propose 'Take-The-Best' (TTB) as the new theory. Unlike Tallying, TTB utilizes feature validities, but unlike WADD, it processes them in a strictly non-compensatory, lexicographic manner. TTB considers features sequentially in descending order of validity and bases the decision entirely on the first feature that discriminates between the two options. This provides a compelling one-reason decision-making alternative to the compensatory WADD model and can naturally produce the high reliance on top validities observed in the data."
