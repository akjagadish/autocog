# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2_1`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2_1`).

Propose a new non-compensatory heuristic to serve as a stronger competitor to Take-The-Best. A good candidate would be a Probabilistic Take-The-Best model (where the feature search order is stochastic but weighted by validity) or an Elimination by Aspects (EBA) model. This will test whether the strict deterministic ordering of TTB is strictly necessary, or if a more flexible non-compensatory process can explain the minor deviations in the data.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB): Decision-makers search through features sequentially but stochastically, with the probability of checking a feature proportional to a non-linear function of its validity (v^gamma). The search stops at the first feature that discriminates between the options, and the option favored by that feature is chosen. If no features discriminate, the decision-maker guesses. Mathematically, this sequential sampling without replacement evaluates to a Luce choice rule over the sum of weights of the discriminating features.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("PTTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Feature selection probabilities are proportional to v^gamma
    weights = validities ** gamma
    
    # Identify discriminating features for each option
    d_a = (a > b).astype(float)
    d_b = (b > a).astype(float)
    
    # Sum of weights of features favoring A and B
    w_a = np.sum(d_a * weights)
    w_b = np.sum(d_b * weights)
    
    # The probability that the first discriminating feature found favors A
    # is exactly w_a / (w_a + w_b) under this sequential search process.
    if w_a + w_b == 0:
        p_a = 0.5
    else:
        p_a = w_a / (w_a + w_b)
        
    p_core = np.array([p_a, 1.0 - p_a])
    
    # Incorporate uniform lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs)


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's suggestion, we implemented a Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB) model. In this model, features are searched sequentially but stochastically, weighted by a non-linear scaling of their validities (v^gamma). The search stops at the first feature that discriminates. Mathematically, the probability that the first drawn discriminating feature favors option A is exactly the sum of weights of features favoring A divided by the total weight of all discriminating features. This yields a Luce choice rule over discriminating features. Unlike WADD (which uses a softmax over score differences and is thus insensitive to the total magnitude of discriminating weights), PTTB's choice probabilities depend on the ratio of discriminating evidence, maintaining the non-compensatory stopping-rule spirit of TTB while naturally explaining stochastic deviations in search order.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2645 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2645.

However, a detailed look at Experiments 4, 5, and 6 shows that it systematically underestimates the subjects' reliance on the most valid discriminating feature. For instance, in Exp 5, humans choose the option favored by the highest-validity discriminating feature 86.7% of the time, whereas the candidate predicts only 57.6%. This happens because the power-law weighting `v^gamma` with gamma bounded at 20 does not create a steep enough drop-off between validities (e.g., 0.95^20 vs 0.90^20 is only about a 3:1 ratio). Consequently, the model behaves too much like a compensatory model when multiple lower-validity features oppose the highest-validity one.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The PTTB mechanism is structurally sound and within the arbiter's prescribed family, but it needs to be able to approximate deterministic TTB more closely to capture the high empirical match rates (0.85-0.90) for the most valid feature. Please keep the PTTB logic but make the feature weighting much steeper. You can do this by either drastically increasing the upper bound of `gamma` (e.g., up to 100) or by changing the weight function to an exponential form like `exp(gamma * validities)` to ensure the highest validity feature can dominate the denominator when necessary."
