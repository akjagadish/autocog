# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic: People make decisions by considering features one at a time, ordered by their validity. They stop at the first feature that discriminates between the options and choose the option with the higher value on that feature. If no features discriminate, they guess. This is a non-compensatory, lexicographic process.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, this implements the Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. TTB is a one-reason, non-compensatory model that searches through features in descending order of validity. It stops at the first discriminating feature and bases the choice entirely on it. This explains the high reliance on the most valid features seen in the data, distinguishing it from both Tallying (which ignores validities) and WADD (which is fully compensatory).

**Parameters:**
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Sort features by validity descending
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, the redundant per-feature `weights` parameter was removed. Instead, the model computes the weighted sums directly using the provided `validities`, scaled by a single non-linear parameter `gamma` (`subjective_weights = validities ** gamma`). This allows the model to flexibly upweight or downweight the relative importance of highly valid cues without injecting excessive noise from independent per-feature parameters. The `beta` range was expanded up to 50.0 to allow for more deterministic choices, and the `epsilon` range was constrained to [0.0, 0.1] to reduce excessive lapsing, enabling the model to match the highly consistent choice proportions (>0.85) observed in the experimental data.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.1]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson 1993).
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current trial:
    # array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Subjective weights are a non-linear scaling of objective validities.
    # gamma > 1 increases the relative weight of highly valid features.
    subjective_weights = validities ** gamma
    
    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with subjective validities).
    scores = stim @ subjective_weights
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB) with exponential weighting: Decision-makers search through features sequentially but stochastically. The probability of checking a feature is proportional to an exponential function of its validity (exp(gamma * validity)), allowing high-validity features to strongly dominate the search order. The search stops at the first feature that discriminates between the options, and the option favored by that feature is chosen. If no features discriminate, the decision-maker guesses. This yields a Luce choice rule over the exponentially weighted discriminating features.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we retain the exact Probabilistic Take-The-Best mechanism with exponential validity weighting, but we tighten the parameter ranges to allow the model to approximate deterministic Take-The-Best even more sharply. We increased the upper bound of gamma to 200.0 to enable steeper drop-offs between closely ranked validities, and reduced the upper bound of epsilon to 0.25 to prevent excessive random guessing that was diluting the deterministic predictions.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 200.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.25]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

        raise ValueError("PTTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Identify discriminating features for each option
    d_a = (a > b).astype(float)
    d_b = (b > a).astype(float)
    d_any = d_a + d_b
    
    if np.sum(d_any) == 0:
        p_a = 0.5
    else:
        # To prevent numerical overflow, subtract max validity among discriminating features
        max_v = np.max(validities[d_any > 0])
        weights = np.exp(gamma * (validities - max_v))
        
        # Sum of weights of features favoring A and B
        w_a = np.sum(d_a * weights)
        w_b = np.sum(d_b * weights)
        
        # The probability that the first discriminating feature found favors A
        p_a = w_a / (w_a + w_b)
        
    p_core = np.array([p_a, 1.0 - p_a])
