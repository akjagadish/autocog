# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace the Mixture Model with a 'Noisy Execution TTB' or 'Probabilistic Cue Retrieval' theory. Since pure TTB fits the data very well but slightly underpredicts the error rate, the new theory should maintain the strict non-compensatory, sequential search architecture of TTB, but introduce cue-level noise rather than just global choice-level noise. For example, assume that when a decision-maker evaluates a cue, there is a probability of skipping it or misperceiving its value (perhaps inversely proportional to its validity). This would naturally generate slightly higher deviation rates on trials where the best cue is noisy, without defaulting to a fully compensatory linear integration like WADD.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Probabilistic Cue Retrieval TTB: Decision-makers follow the non-compensatory, sequential search architecture of Take The Best (TTB), but execution is noisy at the cue level. When a discriminating cue is evaluated, there is a probability of skipping it or failing to retrieve its value. This skip probability is a function of a base skip rate and is inversely proportional to the cue's validity (operationalized via an exponent on the validity). If a cue is skipped, the decision-maker continues to the next most valid cue. This produces slightly higher deviation rates on trials where the best cue is noisy, without defaulting to a fully compensatory linear integration.

def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:

            # Probability of successfully retrieving and using this cue
            # Higher validity means higher chance of evaluation (lower chance of skipping)
            p_eval = (1.0 - p_skip_base) * (validities[idx] ** gamma)

    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)

`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.0, 5.0]
- p_skip: [0.0, 0.5]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's diagnosis, the previous Mixture Model was replaced with a 'Noisy Execution TTB' / 'Probabilistic Cue Retrieval' model. While pure TTB fits the data well, it strictly predicts 100% adherence to the most valid cue, slightly underpredicting the empirical deviation rate. By introducing a cue-level skip probability (parameterized by a base skip rate and an exponent on validity to fulfill the 'inversely proportional to validity' suggestion), the model generates smooth stochastic deviations that naturally increase when the best cue is noisy or less valid, without abandoning the fundamental non-compensatory sequential search architecture.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2634 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2634.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Probabilistic Cue Retrieval TTB model successfully implements the arbiter's recommendation by introducing cue-level noise. However, the simulation results indicate that the model currently predicts a much higher deviation rate than what is observed in humans. For instance, in Experiment 6, the candidate predicts a non-TTB choice rate of 0.4220 compared to the human rate of 0.1693. Similarly, in Experiments 3, 4, and 5, the model severely underpredicts the adherence to the most valid cue. The functional form `p_eval = (1.0 - p_skip_base) * (validities[idx] ** gamma)` likely drives `p_eval` too low when `gamma` is large, resulting in excessive skipping and effectively reducing the model to random guessing.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The model is on the right track but suffers from excessive cue-skipping, leading to under-adherence to the best cues. Please refine the probability of evaluation. Instead of exponentiating the validity directly (which shrinks `p_eval` drastically for `gamma > 1`), consider a formulation where the skip probability decreases more gracefully with validity, such as `p_skip = p_skip_base * (1.0 - validities[idx])` or bounding `gamma` to a much tighter range like [0.0, 1.0]. Additionally, restrict the upper bounds of `p_skip` and `epsilon` (e.g., [0.0, 0.2]) to prevent the optimizer from falling into high-noise regimes."
