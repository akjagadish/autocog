# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Take The Best (TTB) posits that decision-makers do not integrate all available information. Instead, they rank features by their validity (informativeness) and search through them sequentially. The first feature that discriminates between the two options completely determines the choice, and all subsequent features are ignored. If no features discriminate, the decision-maker guesses randomly. This non-compensatory heuristic allows a single highly valid cue to decisively outweigh any number of less valid cues.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To robustly dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from the Weighted Additive rule (WADD), we utilize a 4-feature environment where the highest validity cue is pitted against multiple lower-validity cues. TTB is a non-compensatory heuristic that relies strictly on the single most valid discriminating feature, ignoring all others. In contrast, WADD computes a compensatory weighted sum of all features. By creating trials where one option possesses the single best feature but the other option possesses several slightly less valid features, we engineer a stark divergence: TTB will definitively choose the option with the highest-validity cue, whereas WADD will integrate the multiple lower-validity cues and choose the opposite option. We also include trials where both models agree, and trials where the highest-validity cue is tied, forcing TTB to rely on the second-highest cue while WADD still integrates the remaining cues.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates trials where the highest-validity discriminating cue strongly disagrees with the sum of all remaining lower-validity cues. Take The Best (TTB) will consistently choose the option with the single best cue, whereas the Weighted Additive (WADD) model will frequently compensate and choose the option with multiple lesser cues. By measuring the proportion of choices that align with the TTB prediction on these specific diagnostic trials, we obtain a score that will be close to 1.0 for TTB (minus lapses) and substantially lower for WADD.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To strongly dissociate the Weighted Additive rule (WADD) from Take The Best (TTB), we use a 5-feature environment where the highest-validity cue is repeatedly pitted against multiple lower-validity cues. TTB is strictly non-compensatory and will always choose the option favored by the single most valid discriminating feature, completely ignoring the remaining features. WADD, however, integrates all features weighted by their validities (and subjective weights), allowing multiple weaker cues to overcome a single strong cue. By presenting trials where one option wins on the best feature but the other wins on several less valid features, we can cleanly separate the two models: TTB predicts choices aligned with the single best cue, while WADD predicts choices aligned with the sum of the remaining cues.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design specifically pits the single most valid discriminating feature against multiple less valid features. This metric calculates the proportion of trials where the subject's choice aligns with the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic, which simply follows the first discriminating feature. For a TTB agent, this value will be close to 1.0 (minus lapse rate). For a WADD agent, which integrates all features and will often choose the option favored by the sum of weaker features, this value will be substantially lower (often below 0.5).

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
