# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design tests the quantitative dissociation between a pure Take-The-Best (TTB) model and a Strategy Mixture model (which occasionally uses Tallying). By employing five features with descending validities, we construct critical trials where the highest-validity cue points to one option, but the majority of the remaining cues point to the other option. In these trials, pure TTB will consistently choose the option favored by the single best cue, whereas the Mixture model predicts systematic deviations (a lower choice probability for the TTB-favored option) due to the Tallying component favoring the option with more positive cues. Additional trials where both strategies agree, or where Tallying predicts a tie while TTB has a strict preference, allow precise estimation of the lapse rate versus the specific tallying mixing proportion.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People use a non-compensatory, lexicographic heuristic known as 'Take-The-Best' (TTB) to make decisions. Instead of integrating all available information (as in weighted additive models) or counting all positive features (as in tallying), decision-makers search through features sequentially in descending order of their validity. The search stops at the very first feature that discriminates between the two options (i.e., one option possesses the feature and the other does not). The option that wins on this single discriminating cue is chosen deterministically, and all remaining lower-validity features are completely ignored. If no features discriminate between the options, the decision-maker guesses randomly. Response noise is modeled purely as a lapse rate (epsilon) where the subject occasionally makes a random guess instead of executing the TTB strategy.

**Parameters:**
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Take-The-Best expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Order features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(-validities)
    
    # Default to guessing if all features tie
    p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    
    # Search through features in descending order of validity
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Blend deterministic choice with uniform lapse
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People's decision making in multi-attribute choice is best described by a Strategy Mixture model. While decision-makers predominantly rely on the fast and frugal 'Take-The-Best' (TTB) heuristic—searching through cues in order of validity and stopping at the first discriminating cue—they occasionally switch to a compensatory 'Tallying' strategy (equal-weight counting of winning features). This mixture allows the model to capture both the high overall success of non-compensatory heuristics and the systematic, compensatory-like deviations observed in specific trial types where multiple lower-validity cues contradict a single high-validity cue. Response noise is incorporated as a uniform lapse rate.

**Parameters:**
- p_tally: [0.0, 0.2]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.1]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Strategy Mixture expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # 1. Take-The-Best (TTB) Prediction
    order = np.argsort(-validities)
    p_ttb = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    # 2. Tallying Prediction
    a_wins = np.sum(a > b)
    b_wins = np.sum(b > a)
    if a_wins > b_wins:
        p_tally = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif b_wins > a_wins:
        p_tally = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        p_tally = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    # Blend strategies and add uniform lapse
    p_mix = float(parameters["p_tally"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    p_core = (1.0 - p_mix) * p_ttb + p_mix * p_tally
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
