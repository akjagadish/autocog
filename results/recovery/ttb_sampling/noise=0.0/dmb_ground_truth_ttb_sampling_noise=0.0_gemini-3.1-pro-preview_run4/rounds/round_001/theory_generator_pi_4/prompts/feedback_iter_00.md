# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace the Weighted Additive theory with a 'Strategy Mixture' or 'Probabilistic Take-The-Best' theory. Given that pure TTB captures most of the variance but slightly underpredicts deviations in specific cases (like Exp 4), a strong competitor would be a model where subjects predominantly use TTB but with some probability P switch to a simple 'Tallying' (equal-weight) strategy, or where the cue search order is probabilistic (sampled proportional to cue validity) rather than strictly deterministic. This provides a cognitively plausible alternative that can mimic TTB's high success rate while better explaining the residual compensatory-like deviations.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People's decision making in multi-attribute choice is best described by a Strategy Mixture model. While decision-makers predominantly rely on the fast and frugal 'Take-The-Best' (TTB) heuristic—searching through cues in order of validity and stopping at the first discriminating cue—they occasionally switch to a compensatory 'Tallying' strategy (equal-weight counting of winning features). This mixture allows the model to capture both the high overall success of non-compensatory heuristics and the systematic, compensatory-like deviations observed in specific trial types where multiple lower-validity cues contradict a single high-validity cue. Response noise is incorporated as a uniform lapse rate.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Strategy Mixture expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # 1. Take-The-Best (TTB) Prediction
    order = np.argsort(-validities)
    p_ttb = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    # 2. Tallying Prediction
    a_wins = np.sum(a > b)
    b_wins = np.sum(b > a)
    if a_wins > b_wins:
        p_tally = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif b_wins > a_wins:
        p_tally = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        p_tally = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    # Blend strategies and add uniform lapse
    p_mix = float(parameters["p_tally"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    p_core = (1.0 - p_mix) * p_ttb + p_mix * p_tally
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- p_tally: [0.0, 0.5]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's recommendation, this model replaces the pure Weighted Additive (WADD) approach with a 'Strategy Mixture' of Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying. Since TTB accurately captures the vast majority of the variance but underpredicts compensatory-like deviations (as seen in Experiment 2 and 4), mixing in a probabilistic switch to Tallying allows the model to naturally account for these edge cases. It retains the cognitive plausibility of simple heuristics while providing a mechanism for subjects to occasionally integrate across all cues equally, overcoming the mechanistic failures of the purely compensatory WADD model.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2269 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2269.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Strategy Mixture candidate successfully implements the arbiter's recommendation to blend Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying. It was accepted by the gate, meaning it is an improvement over the previous baseline. However, its predictions across all four experiments show that it deviates too much from the real human data compared to the pure TTB model (pi_3). Specifically, it overpredicts the compensatory/tallying responses in Exp 1 (0.337 vs 0.106), Exp 2 (0.320 vs 0.202), and Exp 4 (0.321 vs 0.138), and underpredicts the TTB adherence in Exp 3 (0.754 vs 0.858). This indicates that the model is attributing too much weight to the Tallying strategy and random noise.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The Strategy Mixture mechanism is theoretically sound and faithfully implements the arbiter's recommendation, but its parameter ranges allow for too much deviation from TTB. To improve the quantitative fit, tighten the parameter ranges to reflect that TTB is the overwhelmingly dominant strategy and lapses/tallying are rare. Reduce the range of `p_tally` from [0.0, 0.5] to [0.0, 0.2], and `epsilon` from [0.0, 0.5] to [0.0, 0.1]. This will allow the model to capture the slight compensatory deviations without washing out the strong non-compensatory main effects."
