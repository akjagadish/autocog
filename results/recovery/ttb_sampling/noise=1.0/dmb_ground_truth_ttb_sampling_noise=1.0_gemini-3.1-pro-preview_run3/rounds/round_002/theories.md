# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic with subjective validity noise: Decision-makers search through features in descending order of their subjective validity, but their assessment of validity is noisy. On any given evaluation, they sample validities with some variance, sort features by these sampled validities, and stop at the first feature that discriminates between the two options. Response noise is modeled via a softmax over the resulting binary preference scores, plus an independent lapse rate. Averaging over multiple samples naturally smooths the aggregate predictions when validities are close.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we introduce a `sigma` parameter to add Gaussian noise to the subjective validities. We sample these noisy validities multiple times (50 iterations for stability) per trial, apply the strict TTB stopping rule for each sample, and average the resulting choice probabilities. This softens the deterministic feature ordering of TTB and captures subjective uncertainty or individual differences in feature validities, preventing extreme deterministic predictions when validities are close.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `sigma`: `[0.0, 2.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

### slot 2 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Strategy Mixture: Decision-makers are heterogeneous and use a mixture of non-compensatory and compensatory heuristics. On any given trial, a decision is made either via Take-The-Best (relying solely on the most valid discriminating feature) or Tallying (counting the total number of winning features), governed by a mixing parameter. When these strategies conflict, their opposing choices average out across the population, naturally capturing the ~0.5 aggregate choice proportions observed across experiments without relying on massive uniform noise.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's recommendation, this theory models a 'Strategy Mixture'. Instead of assuming all subjects use a single heuristic, it posits that the population consists of a mix of decision-makers (or that subjects probabilistically switch strategies). By computing the choice probabilities for both Take-The-Best (non-compensatory) and Tallying (compensatory) and blending them via the `p_ttb` parameter, the model can capture the ~0.5 aggregate choice proportions. When these heuristics conflict—which is common in the experimental designs—their opposing choices naturally average out across the population, providing a mechanistic explanation for the empirical data without relying on excessive random noise.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `p_ttb`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Noisy Weighted Additive (WADD) Model: Decision-makers compute a global value for each option by summing the validities of its active features. Rather than relying on a single discriminating feature (like Take-The-Best) or ignoring validities (like Tallying), WADD integrates all available validities compensatorily. To account for the highly consistent ~0.5 choice probabilities and near-zero differences observed across the experiments, the decision process incorporates a highly prominent noise mechanism. This is modeled via a very low inverse temperature in the softmax choice rule and a potentially high uniform lapse rate, smoothing out predictions and avoiding deterministic swings.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the parameter ranges for beta and epsilon have been tightened to [0.0, 0.5] and [0.5, 1.0] respectively. This minimal edit further flattens the predictions toward 0.5 to eliminate residual WADD-driven signal, better matching the human data's near-perfect 50/50 guessing behavior across these experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.5, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # WADD: Sum of validities for active features for each option
    scores = np.sum(stim * validities, axis=1)
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse rate
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
