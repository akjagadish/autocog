# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People employ a probabilistic 'Take The Best' (TTB) heuristic to make binary choices. They order features by their subjective validity, which is informed by objective validities but subject to random fluctuations (noise). They compare the options sequentially based on this subjective ordering. The first feature that discriminates between the two options determines the choice, and all subsequent features are ignored. This introduces stochasticity into the cue hierarchy, explaining why choices sometimes deviate from strict reliance on the single highest-validity cue.

**Rationale:** To fix the overprediction in Experiment 2 while maintaining the Take The Best mechanism, I introduced a `sigma` parameter that adds Gaussian noise to the validities before sorting. This creates a probabilistic TTB where subjective cue hierarchies occasionally fluctuate, softening the model's rigid reliance on the highest-validity cue and capturing the empirical choice distribution better.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `sigma`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    sigma = float(parameters["sigma"])
    
    # Add Gaussian noise to validities to model subjective fluctuations in cue hierarchy
    noisy_validities = validities + np.random.normal(0, sigma, size=validities.shape)
    
    # Order features by noisy validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(noisy_validities)[::-1]
    
    scores = np.array([0.0, 0.0])
    # Iterate through features in order of validity
    for idx in order:
        if stim[0, idx] > stim[1, idx]:
            scores[0] = 1.0
            break
        elif stim[1, idx] > stim[0, idx]:
            scores[1] = 1.0
            break
            
    # If no features discriminate, both options are tied
    if scores[0] == 0.0 and scores[1] == 0.0:
        scores = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Random Choice / Minimal Effort: In the absence of trial-by-trial feedback and when faced with complex multi-attribute binary arrays, participants largely abandon systematic cue-based strategies. Instead, they resort to minimal effort processing, which manifests as random guessing or behavior dominated by an extremely high lapse rate. Any residual systematicity is extremely weak, resulting in choice probabilities that are consistently very close to 0.5 across all experimental conditions.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this model replaces 'Take The First' with a 'Random Choice / Minimal Effort' theory. Because the empirical metrics consistently hover around 0.5 regardless of the experimental design, it implies that participants are not systematically applying strong heuristics like TTB, WADD, or TTF. Instead, lacking trial-by-trial feedback, they are overwhelmed by the binary arrays and primarily guess. The model captures this by constraining the lapse rate (`epsilon`) to be extremely high (between 0.9 and 1.0) and keeping sensitivity (`beta`) very low, effectively predicting choice probabilities very close to 0.5 for all options.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.9, 1.0]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    # Minimal effort evaluation (e.g., simple tallying of 1s)
    scores = np.sum(stim, axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Dominated by a extremely high lapse rate (epsilon near 1.0)
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Weak Tallying with Position Bias: In the absence of trial-by-trial feedback, participants abandon complex, validity-based compensatory or non-compensatory strategies. Instead, their choices are heavily dominated by random guessing (a very high lapse rate). The tiny fraction of systematic variance that remains is driven by minimal-effort heuristics: a weak preference for the option with a higher total number of positive features (tallying), combined with a slight positional bias that might favor or disfavor features based on reading order.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, I expanded the `position_bias` parameter range from strictly positive [0.0, 2.0] to [-1.0, 1.0]. This allows the model to capture the slight anti-WADD (pure Tallying) preference observed in Experiment 2, where participants sometimes favored the option with more features overall rather than the one with the leftmost features. By allowing negative position bias, the model can perfectly hit the sub-0.5 metric in Experiment 2 while maintaining the high lapse rate that explains the rest of the data.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.8, 1.0]`
  - `position_bias`: `[-1.0, 1.0]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    n_features = stim.shape[1]
    position_bias = float(parameters["position_bias"])
    
    # Features on the left (index 0) get higher weights if position_bias > 0
    # Weights range from 1.0 (rightmost) to 1.0 + position_bias * (n_features - 1) (leftmost)
    w = 1.0 + position_bias * np.arange(n_features - 1, -1, -1)
    
    # Calculate score for each option
    scores = stim @ w
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Dominated by a extremely high lapse rate (epsilon near 1.0)
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
