## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Strategy Mixture Theory: Instead of relying on a single heuristic, decision-makers draw from a repertoire of strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. Specifically, individuals mix between a non-compensatory lexicographic rule (Take-The-Best) and a compensatory rule (Tallying). On any given trial, a subject employs TTB with probability `p_ttb` and Tallying with probability `1 - p_ttb`. This intra-individual strategy variation naturally accounts for the aggregate ~0.50 choice proportions observed in conflict trials where the two heuristics prescribe different options, while a relatively stable mixture proportion across the population explains the low between-subject variance.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's diagnosis, this theory implements a Strategy Mixture model where individuals stochastically alternate between a lexicographic strategy (Take-The-Best) and an equal-weight compensatory strategy (Tallying). By mixing these strategies with a stable probability `p_ttb` centered around 0.5 (sampled from [0.4, 0.6]), the model reproduces the ~0.50 choice rates on conflict trials without collapsing into pure randomness. The narrow range for `p_ttb` ensures that the between-subject variance remains low, faithfully matching the empirical distributions across all experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `p_ttb`: `[0.4, 0.6]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson

    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."

## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Sequential Evidence Accumulation Theory: Decision-makers sample cues sequentially in order of validity and accumulate evidence (counts of features favoring each option). If the difference in accumulated evidence reaches an internal threshold, the search is terminated and a choice is made based on the evidence collected up to that point. If all cues are exhausted without reaching the threshold, a choice is made based on the final accumulated tallies. This single mechanistic process naturally interpolates between Take-The-Best behavior (low threshold) and Tallying behavior (high threshold), while a softmax over the naturally accumulated evidence accounts for the observed stochasticity.

**Rationale:** Following the latest feedback, we revert the evidence accumulation back to unweighted +1.0 counts (since validities weighting was rejected by the gate). To fix the overly deterministic choices in experiments 2, 3, 4, and 5, we adjust the parameter ranges: `threshold` is changed to [1.0, 5.0] to ensure a minimum difference of 1 is required to terminate search, and `beta` is tightened to [0.0, 5.0] to prevent the softmax from becoming too deterministic, naturally encouraging the ~0.5 choice proportions observed in the data.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `threshold`: `[1.0, 5.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
