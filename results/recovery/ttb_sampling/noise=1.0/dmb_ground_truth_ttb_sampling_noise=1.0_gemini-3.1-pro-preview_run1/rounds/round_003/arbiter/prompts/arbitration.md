# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_4" and "pi_5") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_4
Strategy Mixture Theory: Instead of relying on a single heuristic, decision-makers draw from a repertoire of strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. Specifically, individuals mix between a non-compensatory lexicographic rule (Take-The-Best) and a compensatory rule (Tallying). On any given trial, a subject employs TTB with probability `p_ttb` and Tallying with probability `1 - p_ttb`. This intra-individual strategy variation naturally accounts for the aggregate ~0.50 choice proportions observed in conflict trials where the two heuristics prescribe different options, while a relatively stable mixture proportion across the population explains the low between-subject variance.

## THEORY 2 — pi_5
Sequential Evidence Accumulation Theory: Decision-makers sample cues sequentially in order of validity and accumulate evidence (counts of features favoring each option). If the difference in accumulated evidence reaches an internal threshold, the search is terminated and a choice is made based on the evidence collected up to that point. If all cues are exhausted without reaching the threshold, a choice is made based on the final accumulated tallies. This single mechanistic process naturally interpolates between Take-The-Best behavior (low threshold) and Tallying behavior (high threshold), while a softmax over the naturally accumulated evidence accounts for the observed stochasticity.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_4)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates Strategy Mixture Theory from Sequential Evidence Accumulation (SEA) Theory by exploiting their different mechanisms for handling conflict between the most valid cue and the sheer number of cues. Strategy Mixture predicts a trial-by-trial coin flip (choice probability ~0.5) whenever Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying disagree, regardless of the size of the tallying majority. SEA, however, deterministically follows a threshold: a low threshold mimics TTB (always choosing the option favored by the best cue), while a higher threshold allows evidence to accumulate, mimicking Tallying. By varying the point at which the tallying majority overcomes the best cue across trials, SEA is forced to strongly favor one option or the other depending on its fitted threshold, whereas Strategy Mixture consistently predicts ~0.5. Control trials where both heuristics agree ensure that baseline accuracy is maintained, preventing SEA from fitting a near-zero beta to mimic the 0.5 predictions.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Instead of comparing mean choice proportions across different trials, this metric evaluates the within-subject consistency of choices on conflict trials. Under Strategy Mixture Theory, subjects mix between TTB and Tallying on a trial-by-trial basis. Because p_ttb is roughly 0.5, their predicted choice probability on ANY conflict trial is approximately 0.5, meaning their responses will look like coin flips and the consistency score will be near 0. Under Sequential Evidence Accumulation, a subject has a fixed internal threshold. For any given conflict trial, this fixed threshold will consistently favor either the TTB option (if the threshold is low and reached early) or the Tallying option (if the threshold is high). Thus, SEA predicts highly deterministic behavior for a given subject on a given trial (consistency score near 1.0, attenuated only by the softmax epsilon). This creates a massive, stable gap between the theories that avoids the high between-subject variance associated with comparing specific trial types.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates Sequential Evidence Accumulation (SEA) Theory from Strategy Mixture Theory. Strategy Mixture Theory predicts a choice proportion near 0.50 whenever Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying conflict, because it mixes these two strategies trial-by-trial. SEA, on the other hand, accumulates evidence sequentially and stops when a threshold is reached. By varying the sequence in which evidence arrives across different conflict trials (e.g., Option A wins the first cue, but Option B wins the next three vs. Option A wins the first two cues, but Option B wins the next three), we can manipulate whether SEA's threshold is triggered early (favoring A) or late/never (favoring B). This causes SEA to make deterministic, varying predictions across different conflict trials depending on the threshold parameter, while Strategy Mixture remains rigidly stuck at predicting ~0.50 for all of them.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the difference in the proportion of choices favoring the Take-The-Best (TTB) option between Trial 2 and Trial 1. Under Strategy Mixture Theory, both trials pit TTB against Tallying in exactly the same way, so the expected choice proportion for the TTB option should be approximately equal (yielding a difference near 0). Under Sequential Evidence Accumulation Theory, the maximum evidence difference favoring the TTB option is 1 in Trial 1 (so stopping early is rare) but 2 in Trial 2 (so stopping early is much more likely if the threshold is between 1 and 2). Thus, SEA predicts a significantly higher probability of choosing the TTB option in Trial 2 than in Trial 1, yielding a large positive difference.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all 8 experiments, Theory 1 (Strategy Mixture, pi_4) consistently and accurately predicts the observed data, whereas Theory 2 (Sequential Evidence Accumulation, pi_5) fails dramatically. The observed data shows that subjects' behavior on conflict trials is highly stochastic (near 0.5 choice proportions and low within-subject consistency), which is perfectly captured by the trial-by-trial mixing of Take-The-Best and Tallying in Theory 1. Theory 2 predicts deterministic threshold-based behavior that results in high consistency and extreme choice proportions, which strongly contradicts the empirical results. Because Theory 1 is already exceptionally strong and Theory 2's core sequential mechanism is fundamentally at odds with the data, Theory 2 is degenerate and should be replaced with a brand-new competitor.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a completely new theory to serve as a stronger competitor to the Strategy Mixture theory. Since sequential accumulation failed, consider a Parallel Constraint Satisfaction or a non-linear Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. In a non-linear WADD model, decision-makers integrate all available cues simultaneously, but the subjective weight assigned to each cue is a non-linear transformation of its objective validity (e.g., heavily overweighting the most valid cue while still considering the rest). This could potentially mimic the ~0.5 conflict trial behavior if the subjective weight of the top cue roughly balances the sum of the remaining cues, offering a single-process compensatory alternative to the dual-process Strategy Mixture."
