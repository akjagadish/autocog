# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Propose a completely new theory to serve as a stronger competitor to the Strategy Mixture theory. Since sequential accumulation failed, consider a Parallel Constraint Satisfaction or a non-linear Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. In a non-linear WADD model, decision-makers integrate all available cues simultaneously, but the subjective weight assigned to each cue is a non-linear transformation of its objective validity (e.g., heavily overweighting the most valid cue while still considering the rest). This could potentially mimic the ~0.5 conflict trial behavior if the subjective weight of the top cue roughly balances the sum of the remaining cues, offering a single-process compensatory alternative to the dual-process Strategy Mixture.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.979)

**Description**
Strategy Mixture Theory: Instead of relying on a single heuristic, decision-makers draw from a repertoire of strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. Specifically, individuals mix between a non-compensatory lexicographic rule (Take-The-Best) and a compensatory rule (Tallying). On any given trial, a subject employs TTB with probability `p_ttb` and Tallying with probability `1 - p_ttb`. This intra-individual strategy variation naturally accounts for the aggregate ~0.50 choice proportions observed in conflict trials where the two heuristics prescribe different options, while a relatively stable mixture proportion across the population explains the low between-subject variance.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.249)

**Description**
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.156)

**Description**
Sequential Evidence Accumulation Theory: Decision-makers sample cues sequentially in order of validity and accumulate evidence (counts of features favoring each option). If the difference in accumulated evidence reaches an internal threshold, the search is terminated and a choice is made based on the evidence collected up to that point. If all cues are exhausted without reaching the threshold, a choice is made based on the final accumulated tallies. This single mechanistic process naturally interpolates between Take-The-Best behavior (low threshold) and Tallying behavior (high threshold), while a softmax over the naturally accumulated evidence accounts for the observed stochasticity.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.4556 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4556 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Non-linear Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory: Decision-makers integrate all available cues simultaneously in a compensatory manner, but the subjective weight assigned to each cue is a non-linear power transformation of its objective validity. A large exponent heavily overweights the most valid cues while still retaining some influence of less valid cues. This single-process mechanism naturally mimics the ~0.5 choice proportions observed in conflict trials (where the top cue balances the sum of the rest) without requiring a dual-process strategy mixture.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Non-linear power transformation of validities to subjective weights
    weights = validities ** gamma
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features for each option
    scores = stim @ weights
    
    # Softmax choice rule
    z = beta * scores
    z = z - np.max(z)
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.0, 20.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory replaces the failed Sequential Evidence Accumulation model with a Non-linear Weighted Additive (WADD) model. Instead of positing an explicit mixture of TTB and Tallying strategies across trials, this theory proposes a single compensatory process where subjective weights are a power function of objective validities. By tuning the exponent `gamma`, the model can smoothly interpolate between equal weighting (Tallying-like, gamma=0) and extreme overweighting of the top cue (TTB-like, high gamma). A moderate-to-high gamma allows the subjective weight of the top cue to perfectly balance the sum of the remaining cues, naturally explaining the ~0.5 choice proportions in conflict trials and providing a simpler, more robust explanation of the data than the dual-process Strategy Mixture.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The non-linear WADD candidate implements the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family, but it fails to capture the ~0.5 choice proportions and low within-subject consistency on conflict trials. In Experiment 2 (WADD vs Tallying), the simulated choice proportion is 0.84, whereas humans are at 0.50. In Experiment 5 (extremity) and Experiment 7 (consistency), the model is far too deterministic (simulated 0.45 vs real 0.06 in Exp 7). This happens because the model fits a high `beta` to capture easy trials, which then amplifies even tiny score differences on conflict trials, forcing the model to make deterministic choices rather than randomizing.
Rationale: Keep the Non-linear WADD mechanism, but adjust the softmax choice rule to reduce determinism specifically on conflict trials. I recommend scaling the softmax precision `beta` by the inverse of the total score: `effective_beta = beta / (np.sum(scores) + 1e-6)`. In conflict trials, both options have strong features, so the sum of scores is high, which will lower the effective beta and push choice probabilities closer to 0.5. In easy trials, the sum is lower or the score difference is massively pronounced, preserving accuracy. Implement this `effective_beta` in the predict function.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4556 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "rationale": "Applying the critic's minimal-diff advice: I scaled the softmax precision `beta` by the inverse of the total score (`effective_beta = beta / (np.sum(scores) + 1e-6)`). In conflict trials where both options have strong features, the sum of scores is high, which lowers the effective beta and pushes the choice probabilities closer to 0.5, capturing the observed non-deterministic behavior and low within-subject consistency without breaking the core Non-linear WADD mechanism."
