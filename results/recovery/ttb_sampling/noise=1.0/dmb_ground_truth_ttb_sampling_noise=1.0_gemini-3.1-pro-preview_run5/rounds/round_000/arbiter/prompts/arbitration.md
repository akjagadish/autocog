# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To dissociate Tallying from WADD, we must present choices where one option has more positive features (favored by Tallying) but the alternative option's fewer positive features have much higher validities (favored by WADD). By using a set of 5 features with a steep drop-off in validities (e.g., two very high, three relatively low), we can create trials where the sheer count of features points to one option while the weighted sum points to the other. The design includes both congruent and incongruent trials to isolate the specific contribution of feature weighting versus simple counting.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates the specific incongruent trials where Tallying and Weighted Additive (WADD) make opposing predictions. In these trials, one option has more positive features (favored by Tallying) while the other option has fewer features but with much higher validities (favored by WADD). The metric calculates the proportion of choices on these trials that align with the Tallying prediction (choosing the option with more features). Tallying will produce a high value near 1.0, whereas WADD will produce a low value near 0.0.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate WADD from Tallying, we use a 5-feature design with a steep drop-off in validities (two high validities, three low validities). This allows us to construct 'incongruent' trials where one option wins on the sheer count of features (favored by Tallying) while the other option wins on the sum of validities due to possessing fewer but much more predictive features (favored by WADD). We also include trials where Tallying sees a tie but WADD has a strong preference, as well as congruent trials where both models agree. This variety ensures that the distinct response patterns of simple counting versus weighted integration can be identified.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices favoring the option with fewer, but highly valid features ([1, 1, 0, 0, 0]) over the option with more, but less valid features ([0, 0, 1, 1, 1]). WADD is expected to prefer the former due to its high validity sum, resulting in a metric value > 0.5. Tallying will strictly prefer the latter because it counts 3 features against 2, resulting in a metric value < 0.5.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across both experiments, we observe a choice proportion of approximately 0.50 with very low between-subject variance on incongruent trials contrasting an option with fewer, higher-validity features (e.g., [1,1,0,0,0]) against one with more, lower-validity features (e.g., [0,0,1,1,1]). Tallying (pi_1) incorrectly predicts a near-deterministic preference for the option with more features (~0.85 and ~0.14 on the two metrics). WADD (pi_2) predicts values closer to 0.5, but its high simulated variance suggests it relies on parameter noise to achieve this, whereas the real data shows subjects are consistently near 0.5. The observed ~0.50 proportion with low variance strongly implies a probabilistic strategy at the trial level. Specifically, the sum of validities for the first two features (0.95 + 0.90 = 1.85) is almost equal to the sum for the last three (0.60 + 0.55 + 0.50 = 1.65). If subjects sample a single cue proportional to its validity on each trial and choose the option it favors, the probability of choosing the first option would be 1.85 / 3.5 \u2248 0.53, perfectly matching the ~0.50 observed choice rates and explaining the low variance.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Probabilistic Cue Sampling' theory to replace Tallying. In this theory, rather than integrating all cues (like WADD) or counting wins (like Tallying), the decision-maker samples a single feature on each trial with probability proportional to its subjective validity. They then choose the option that has a higher value on that sampled feature. If the options tie on the sampled feature, they guess uniformly. This will naturally predict the ~0.5 choice proportions with low variance on trials where the validity sums of the favoring cues are roughly equal."
