## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended heuristics (e.g. TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every heuristic agrees, and prefer pairs that dissociate single-feature focus from feature-summing strategies. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Probabilistic Cue Sampling with Softmax Validities: Decision-makers evaluate options by sampling a single feature on each trial. The probability of sampling a feature is determined by a softmax function over the objective validities scaled by a sensitivity parameter gamma. The option that is superior on the sampled feature is chosen; ties result in guessing. This predicts intermediate choice proportions when validities are mixed, avoiding deterministic winner-takes-all behavior.

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [0.0, 2.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Compute subjective validities using softmax for sampling probabilities
    z = gamma * validities
    z = z - np.max(z)  # numerical stability
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_feat = e / np.sum(e)

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]

    # Identify wins and ties for each feature
    a_wins = (a > b).astype(float)
    b_wins = (b > a).astype(float)
    ties = (a == b).astype(float)

    # Analytically marginalize over the sampled feature:
    # P(Choose A) = sum_i P(sample i) * P(Choose A | sample i)
    # P(Choose A | sample i) = 1 if a_i > b_i, 0 if b_i > a_i, 0.5 if a_i == b_i
    p_A = np.sum(p_feat * (a_wins + 0.5 * ties))
    p_B = np.sum(p_feat * (b_wins + 0.5 * ties))

    p_core = np.array([p_A, p_B])

    # Apply uniform lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities
- weights: [(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] To dissociate Tallying from WADD, we must present choices where one option has more positive features (favored by Tallying) but the alternative option's fewer positive features have much higher validities (favored by WADD). By using a set of 5 features with a steep drop-off in validities (e.g., two very high, three relatively low), we can create trials where the sheer count of features points to one option while the weighted sum points to the other. The design includes both congruent and incongruent trials to isolate the specific contribution of feature weighting versus simple counting.

[1] To quantitatively dissociate WADD from Tallying, we use a 5-feature design with a steep drop-off in validities (two high validities, three low validities). This allows us to construct 'incongruent' trials where one option wins on the sheer count of features (favored by Tallying) while the other option wins on the sum of validities due to possessing fewer but much more predictive features (favored by WADD). We also include trials where Tallying sees a tie but WADD has a strong preference, as well as congruent trials where both models agree. This variety ensures that the distinct response patterns of simple counting versus weighted integration can be identified.

[2] To quantitatively dissociate Probabilistic Cue Sampling (PCS) from Weighted Additive (WADD) models, we exploit the fundamental difference between single-cue sampling (where choice probability is driven by a softmax over validities) and compensatory integration (where all cues are weighted and summed). By using a 5-feature design with linearly spaced validities, we can construct trials where WADD predicts strong preferences due to the combined weight of multiple lower-validity cues, while PCS predicts the opposite preference because the single highest-validity cue dominates the sampling probability. Furthermore, we include trials where WADD computes a near-tie (e.g., sum of validities for A equals sum for B) but PCS predicts a clear preference because the convexity of the softmax function heavily amplifies the difference between the top validities.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — heuristics that rely on validity-ordering re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) collapse WADD into a scaled Equal-Weight rule and make them indistinguishable by any decision.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended heuristics (TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) be dissociated; avoid trials where every heuristic agrees.

  "rationale": "To quantitatively dissociate Probabilistic Cue Sampling (PCS) from the Weighted Additive rule (WADD), this design exploits the core difference in their integration mechanisms: PCS uses a softmax over validities to sample a single feature, amplifying the influence of the highest-validity cue, whereas WADD linearly integrates all features. We use four cues with linearly spaced validities. We include 'compensatory' trials where one option possesses the single highest-validity cue but the other possesses all remaining cues (PCS prefers the former, WADD strongly prefers the latter). We also include 'tie-breaker' trials where the sum of validities is equal across both options (yielding a tie in WADD), but the convexity of the softmax in PCS leads to a strong preference for the option with the most valid cue.",
