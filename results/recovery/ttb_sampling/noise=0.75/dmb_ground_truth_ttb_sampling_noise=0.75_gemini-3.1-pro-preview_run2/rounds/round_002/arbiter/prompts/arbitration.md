# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic: People make decisions by ranking features according to their validities and choosing the option that is favored by the single most valid discriminating feature. If no feature discriminates, they guess. This is a lexicographic, non-compensatory strategy. However, human execution of this strategy is highly noisy, so choice probabilities are heavily tempered by response noise (low beta) and random guessing lapses (high epsilon).

## THEORY 2 — pi_4
Hybrid Dual-Process Model (Take-The-Best + Tallying) with Decoupled Noise: Human decision-making in multi-attribute choice is predominantly non-compensatory, relying on the single most valid cue (Take-The-Best). However, subjects sometimes fall back on a simpler, unweighted compensatory strategy that merely counts the number of winning features (Tallying). Choice behavior is a probabilistic mixture of TTB and Tallying. Because the internal scales of TTB (binary 0 or 1) and Tallying (counts from 0 to n) differ significantly, the response noise (inverse temperature) for each strategy is decoupled, allowing independent sharpness for each process before they are mixed.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 10: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate pure Take-The-Best (TTB) from a Hybrid TTB+Tallying model, we exploit a key property of the pure TTB model: its predicted choice probability depends entirely on the single most valid discriminating feature and is invariant to the number of remaining cues that support or oppose that choice. In contrast, the Hybrid model mixes TTB with a Tallying process, which counts the total number of winning features for each option. By holding the TTB prediction constant (e.g., Option A always wins on the most valid feature) while parametrically varying the Tallying support (from strongly opposing A to strongly supporting A), the pure TTB model predicts a flat, constant choice probability across these conditions, whereas the Hybrid model predicts a graded modulation of choice probability. The trial set includes a full spectrum of Tallying support levels for both Option A and Option B TTB-winners.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric computes the difference in the probability of choosing the Take-The-Best (TTB) winner between trials where Tallying strongly supports the TTB winner (TTB winner has 4 positive features) and trials where Tallying strongly opposes the TTB winner (TTB winner has only 1 positive feature). Under the pure TTB theory, the number of supporting features is irrelevant, so this difference should be zero (subject to noise). Under the Hybrid model, the Tallying process will pull choices away from the TTB winner when support is low, and push choices toward it when support is high, resulting in a significantly positive difference.

  trial 12: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the pure Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic from the Hybrid (TTB + Tallying) model by testing for strict preference reversals. Pure TTB is strictly non-compensatory: it predicts that the option favored by the single most valid discriminating feature will ALWAYS be preferred (choice probability > 0.5), regardless of how many lower-validity cues oppose it. In contrast, the Hybrid model mixes TTB with a compensatory Tallying process. If the Tallying process strongly opposes the TTB prediction (e.g., the TTB winner is opposed by 5 or 6 lower-validity cues), the Hybrid model allows the choice probability to cross the 50% threshold, resulting in a preference reversal. By parametrically increasing the number of opposing cues (from 1 to 6) against the single best cue, we can detect whether subjects exhibit this compensatory preference reversal (supporting the Hybrid model) or maintain a constant, non-compensatory preference (supporting pure TTB).

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the drop in the probability of choosing the Take-The-Best (TTB) winner as the number of cues favoring the opposing option increases. Under the pure TTB theory, the choice depends exclusively on the single most valid cue, so the number of opposing cues should have zero effect (the metric should be near 0). Under the Hybrid theory, the compensatory Tallying process increasingly favors the TTB loser as it accumulates more winning features, pulling the mixed choice probability away from the TTB winner. Therefore, the Hybrid model predicts a strictly positive difference (p_few > p_many).

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all experiments, Theory 1 (pi_3: Pure Take-The-Best with noise) consistently outperforms Theory 2 (pi_4: Hybrid TTB + Tallying). The critical tests in Experiments 1 and 2 reveal that subjects' probability of choosing the TTB winner does not vary significantly with the number of opposing or supporting cues, yielding metrics near zero. This starkly contradicts the Hybrid model's prediction of a compensatory tallying effect, while perfectly aligning with the non-compensatory predictions of pure TTB. Experiments 3 through 6 further demonstrate that the pure TTB model closely matches the observed choice proportions, whereas the Hybrid model consistently underestimates the reliance on the primary cue.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Theory 2 (Hybrid TTB + Tallying) is empirically falsified by the data, as subjects do not exhibit compensatory tallying behavior. Propose a brand-new theory to provide a stronger, more nuanced competitor to the deterministic-ranking TTB model. A promising direction is a 'Probabilistic Cue Selection' or 'Stochastic TTB' model: instead of strictly ranking features by validity, subjects sample a feature to evaluate with a probability proportional to its validity (e.g., via a softmax over validities). If the sampled feature discriminates, they use it; otherwise, they sample again. This maintains the non-compensatory nature of the decision (relying on a single cue) but introduces variability in *which* cue is selected, offering an alternative mechanistic explanation for the observed choice noise without relying on compensatory tallying."
