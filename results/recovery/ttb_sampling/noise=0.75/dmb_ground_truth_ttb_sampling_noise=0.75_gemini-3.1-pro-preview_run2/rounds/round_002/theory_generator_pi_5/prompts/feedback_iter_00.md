# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Theory 2 (Hybrid TTB + Tallying) is empirically falsified by the data, as subjects do not exhibit compensatory tallying behavior. Propose a brand-new theory to provide a stronger, more nuanced competitor to the deterministic-ranking TTB model. A promising direction is a 'Probabilistic Cue Selection' or 'Stochastic TTB' model: instead of strictly ranking features by validity, subjects sample a feature to evaluate with a probability proportional to its validity (e.g., via a softmax over validities). If the sampled feature discriminates, they use it; otherwise, they sample again. This maintains the non-compensatory nature of the decision (relying on a single cue) but introduces variability in *which* cue is selected, offering an alternative mechanistic explanation for the observed choice noise without relying on compensatory tallying.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Probabilistic Cue Selection (Stochastic TTB): Human decision-makers use a non-compensatory, one-reason heuristic but are stochastic in their cue retrieval. Instead of strictly ranking features by validity, subjects sample a feature to evaluate with a probability proportional to its validity (via a softmax). If the sampled feature discriminates between the options, they base their choice entirely on that feature. If it does not discriminate, they sample again. This maintains the non-compensatory nature of the decision while naturally introducing variability in which cue is selected, offering a mechanistic explanation for choice noise without relying on compensatory tallying.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Identify which features discriminate between A and B
    discrim = (a != b)
    
    if not np.any(discrim):
        # If no features discriminate, the decision is a random guess
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        # The subject repeatedly samples features proportional to exp(gamma * validity)
        # until a discriminating feature is found. The probability that the first
        # discriminating feature found is feature i is equivalent to a softmax over
        # the validities restricted to the set of discriminating features.
        z = gamma * validities[discrim]
        z = z - np.max(z)  # For numerical stability
        w = np.exp(z)
        w = w / np.sum(w)
        
        # The chosen discriminating feature dictates the choice entirely.
        # Sum the probabilities of sampling a feature that favors A vs B.
        favor_a = (a[discrim] > b[discrim])
        favor_b = (b[discrim] > a[discrim])
        
        p_a = np.sum(w[favor_a])
        p_b = np.sum(w[favor_b])
        
        p_core = np.array([p_a, p_b])
        
    # Blend with a uniform lapse rate for general response noise/inattention
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.0, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's guidance, this model completely replaces the compensatory Tallying fallback of the previous hybrid model with a Stochastic Take-The-Best mechanism. Instead of deterministic cue ranking, subjects sample cues with probability proportional to their validities (controlled by an inverse temperature, gamma). By conditioning the choice on the first sampled cue that discriminates, the model produces exact choice probabilities analytically equivalent to a softmax over the validities of only the discriminating features. This approach preserves the non-compensatory nature of the heuristic while explaining behavioral variability through stochastic cue selection rather than tallying.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1544 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1544.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate implements the Stochastic TTB (Probabilistic Cue Selection) model correctly as requested by the arbiter. The model evaluates discriminating features with probability proportional to exp(gamma * validity) and makes choices based on the sampled cue. The loop accepted this candidate, achieving an aggregate loss that sets a new running best. It successfully captures the core empirical signature: people generally follow higher validity cues but with systematic noise that scales with validities, without resorting to compensatory tallying. It does well on Experiment 6 (0.0100 vs 0.0162) and Experiment 3 (0.6414 vs 0.5876). While there are slight deviations in Experiments 1 and 2 compared to the deterministic models, the overall fit across the 6 experiments is strong, and it faithfully implements the arbiter's prescribed mechanism.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate successfully implements the stochastic TTB mechanism, providing a non-compensatory explanation for choice noise. The loss improved, and the predictions align reasonably well with the real data across all experiments. The candidate is good enough to proceed."
