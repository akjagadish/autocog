# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic: People make decisions by ranking features according to their validities and choosing the option that is favored by the single most valid discriminating feature. If no feature discriminates, they guess. This is a lexicographic, non-compensatory strategy. However, human execution of this strategy is highly noisy, so choice probabilities are heavily tempered by response noise (low beta) and random guessing lapses (high epsilon).

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the upper bound of the `beta` parameter has been further reduced from 5.0 to 2.0. This ensures the softmax generates even softer probabilities, capturing the highly noisy, near-guessing behavior observed in the human data while maintaining the core Take-The-Best mechanism.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 2.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Rank features by validity in descending order.
    # We use a stable sort to preserve the original feature order in case of ties.
    ranked_features = np.argsort(validities, kind='stable')[::-1]
    
    scores = np.array([0.0, 0.0])
    # Find the first feature that discriminates between the two options
    for idx in ranked_features:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            scores[0] = 1.0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            scores[1] = 1.0
            break
            
    # If no feature discriminates, the core preference is uniform
    if scores[0] == 0.0 and scores[1] == 0.0:
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        beta = float(parameters["beta"])
        # Softmax over the scores to introduce response noise
        z = beta * scores
        z = z - np.max(z)
        e = np.exp(z)
        p_core = e / np.sum(e)
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Hybrid Dual-Process Model (Take-The-Best + Tallying) with Decoupled Noise: Human decision-making in multi-attribute choice is predominantly non-compensatory, relying on the single most valid cue (Take-The-Best). However, subjects sometimes fall back on a simpler, unweighted compensatory strategy that merely counts the number of winning features (Tallying). Choice behavior is a probabilistic mixture of TTB and Tallying. Because the internal scales of TTB (binary 0 or 1) and Tallying (counts from 0 to n) differ significantly, the response noise (inverse temperature) for each strategy is decoupled, allowing independent sharpness for each process before they are mixed.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's diagnosis, the previous model forced a shared beta parameter to scale both TTB scores (which are binary 0/1) and Tallying scores (which range from 0 to 5). This shared scaling artificially constrained the model, making TTB too noisy or Tallying too deterministic, leading to under-prediction of TTB choices and over-prediction of Tallying choices. I replaced the single `beta` parameter with independent `beta_ttb` and `beta_tally` parameters to decouple the noise levels of the two strategies, allowing each to be fit with its appropriate sharpness.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta_ttb`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `beta_tally`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Probabilistic Cue Selection (Stochastic TTB): Human decision-makers use a non-compensatory, one-reason heuristic but are stochastic in their cue retrieval. Instead of strictly ranking features by validity, subjects sample a feature to evaluate with a probability proportional to its validity (via a softmax). If the sampled feature discriminates between the options, they base their choice entirely on that feature. If it does not discriminate, they sample again. This maintains the non-compensatory nature of the decision while naturally introducing variability in which cue is selected, offering a mechanistic explanation for choice noise without relying on compensatory tallying.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's guidance, this model completely replaces the compensatory Tallying fallback of the previous hybrid model with a Stochastic Take-The-Best mechanism. Instead of deterministic cue ranking, subjects sample cues with probability proportional to their validities (controlled by an inverse temperature, gamma). By conditioning the choice on the first sampled cue that discriminates, the model produces exact choice probabilities analytically equivalent to a softmax over the validities of only the discriminating features. This approach preserves the non-compensatory nature of the heuristic while explaining behavioral variability through stochastic cue selection rather than tallying.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        # The subject repeatedly samples features proportional to exp(gamma * validity)

        # discriminating feature found is feature i is equivalent to a softmax over
        # the validities restricted to the set of discriminating features.
