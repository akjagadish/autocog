## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Take The Best (TTB) is a non-compensatory lexicographic heuristic. Decision makers rank features according to their validity. To choose between two options, they compare them on the most valid feature. If one option has a higher value on this feature, it is chosen immediately, and all remaining features are ignored. If the options are tied on this feature, the decision maker moves to the next most valid feature, and so on. If the options tie on all features, the decision maker guesses randomly. Response noise is modeled via a simple lapse rate (epsilon) where the subject makes a random choice instead of following the TTB rule. The lapse rate can be high, reflecting significant guessing in the empirical data.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, I widened the epsilon parameter range from [0.0, 0.5] to [0.0, 1.0]. The human responses in the given experiments are closer to 0.5 than strict TTB allows with a small lapse rate. Allowing epsilon to range up to 1.0 enables the model to fit higher levels of behavioral noise (random guessing) while preserving the core TTB lexicographic mechanism.

**Parameters:**
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Order features by validity, descending
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    # Find the first discriminating feature
    chosen = -1
    for idx in order:
        if stim[0, idx] > stim[1, idx]:
            chosen = 0
            break
        elif stim[1, idx] > stim[0, idx]:
            chosen = 1
            break
            
    if chosen == 0:
        p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif chosen == 1:
        p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        # Tie on all features
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Strategy Selection (Mixed Heuristic) with Linear Tallying: Decision makers probabilistically select between a non-compensatory lexicographic heuristic (Take The Best) and a simple compensatory heuristic (Tallying). To prevent extreme over-sensitivity when feature differences are large, the compensatory Tallying component uses a simple proportional (linear) rule rather than an exponential softmax.

**Rationale:** Following the latest feedback, I reverted to the successful Iteration 1 base (a fixed-probability mixture of Take The Best and Tallying) but replaced the exponential softmax in the Tallying component with a linear proportional rule (`scores / sum(scores)`). The beta parameter has been removed entirely. This linear scaling prevents the Tallying component from confidently overpowering the TTB component when feature differences are large, which dampens the extreme compensatory pull in Experiment 4 and should push its metric closer to the observed flat response without breaking the fits in Experiments 1 and 2.

  - `p_ttb`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
