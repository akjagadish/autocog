# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Take The Best (TTB) is a fast-and-frugal lexicographic heuristic for multi-attribute choice. Instead of integrating all available information (like WADD) or counting unweighted cues (like Tallying), decision-makers search through features in descending order of their validity. The search stops at the first cue that discriminates between the two options, and the option favored by that cue is chosen. If no cue discriminates, the decision-maker guesses. This non-compensatory mechanism allows for rapid choices that often match more complex compensatory rules in environments with dispersed cue validities. Response noise is higher than previously assumed, reflecting softer empirical choice rates.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the core Take The Best (TTB) mechanism is preserved, but the parameter ranges for `beta` and `epsilon` have been adjusted. The upper bound of `beta` is reduced to 3.0 (from 20.0) and the upper bound of `epsilon` is increased to 0.8 (from 0.5) to soften the model's predictions. This prevents the model from being overly deterministic, allowing it to better match the moderate choice proportions observed in the empirical data (e.g., 63% in Exp 1) rather than making extreme predictions.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 3.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.8]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

        raise ValueError(f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort cues in descending order of validity
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    scores = np.zeros(2)
    
    # Lexicographic search: stop at the first discriminating cue
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            scores[0] = 1.0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            scores[1] = 1.0

```


### slot 2 — `pi_4` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Strategy Mixture (Take-The-Best and Weighted Additive)

**Rationale:** Pure Take-The-Best (TTB) underpredicts compensatory behavior, while pure Weighted Additive (WADD) drastically overpredicts it. In reality, human decision-making is heterogeneous: some subjects rely on fast-and-frugal heuristics like TTB, while others integrate information compensatorily like WADD, or individuals probabilistically switch between strategies depending on task demands. This Strategy Mixture theory models choice as a probabilistic blend of TTB and WADD, smoothly capturing the intermediate choice proportions observed across experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta_ttb`: `[0.1, 5.0]`
  - `beta_wadd`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `mixture_ttb`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Mixture expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # --- TTB (Take-The-Best) Process ---
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    scores_ttb = np.zeros(2)
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            scores_ttb[0] = 1.0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            scores_ttb[1] = 1.0
            break
            
    beta_ttb = float(parameters["beta_ttb"])
    z_ttb = beta_ttb * (scores_ttb - scores_ttb.max())
    e_ttb = np.exp(z_ttb)
    p_ttb = e_ttb / e_ttb.sum()
    
    # --- WADD (Weighted Additive) Process ---
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    scores_wadd = stim @ (validities * w)
    
    beta_wadd = float(parameters["beta_wadd"])
    z_wadd = beta_wadd * (scores_wadd - scores_wadd.max())
    e_wadd = np.exp(z_wadd)
    p_wadd = e_wadd / e_wadd.sum()
    
    # --- Mixture ---
    mix = float(parameters["mixture_ttb"])
    p_mix = mix * p_ttb + (1.0 - mix) * p_wadd
    
    # --- Lapse ---
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    n_opts = p_mix.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_mix + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Threshold-based Sequential Search integrates the fast-and-frugal nature of Take-The-Best with the compensatory evidence accumulation of Weighted Additive (WADD) models. Decision-makers search through cues in descending order of their validity, maintaining a running tally of the evidence (weighted by each cue's validity). Instead of stopping at the very first discriminating cue, search terminates only when the absolute accumulated evidence exceeds an internal confidence threshold. If all cues are exhausted without reaching this threshold, the option with the higher accumulated evidence is chosen. This allows for fast, one-reason decisions when a highly valid cue strongly favors one option, while enabling compensatory behavior when early cues provide weak or conflicting evidence.

**Rationale:** Based on the critic's feedback, tightening the threshold to [0.0, 1.0] overcorrected and underpredicted compensatory behavior, while [0.0, 1.5] slightly overpredicted it. A middle-ground threshold range of [0.0, 1.25] gently balances fast-and-frugal stopping with compensatory accumulation. Additionally, reducing the maximum lapse rate (epsilon) to 0.25 prevents the model from relying on excessive uniform noise to fit the data.

**Parameters:**
  - `threshold`: `[0.0, 1.25]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.25]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    # Sort cues in descending order of validity

    evidence = 0.0
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    
    # Sequential search with evidence accumulation
    for idx in order:
        diff = a[idx] - b[idx]
        evidence += diff * validities[idx]
        
        # Stop search if the confidence threshold is met or exceeded

            break
