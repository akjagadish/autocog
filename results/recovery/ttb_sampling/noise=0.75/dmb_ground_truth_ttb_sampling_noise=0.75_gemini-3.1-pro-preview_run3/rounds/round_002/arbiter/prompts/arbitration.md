# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Take The Best (TTB) is a fast-and-frugal lexicographic heuristic for multi-attribute choice. Instead of integrating all available information (like WADD) or counting unweighted cues (like Tallying), decision-makers search through features in descending order of their validity. The search stops at the first cue that discriminates between the two options, and the option favored by that cue is chosen. If no cue discriminates, the decision-maker guesses. This non-compensatory mechanism allows for rapid choices that often match more complex compensatory rules in environments with dispersed cue validities. Response noise is higher than previously assumed, reflecting softer empirical choice rates.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the pure Take-The-Best (TTB) theory from a Strategy Mixture (TTB + WADD) theory, we use a 5-feature design with a relatively flat but strictly descending validity profile. TTB dictates that choices are driven entirely by the single most valid discriminating cue. The Mixture model allows for choices to be influenced by the Weighted Additive (WADD) value. By pitting an option that wins on the highest validity cue against an option that wins on multiple lower-validity cues, we create strong 'compensatory' conflicts. A pure TTB decision-maker will consistently choose the option favored by the top cue, whereas a Mixture decision-maker will exhibit choice probabilities that are softened or reversed by the WADD component. We include various degrees of conflict (e.g., top cue vs. 4 lower cues, top cue vs. 2 lower cues) and agreement trials to accurately estimate noise and mixture parameters.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the difference in the rate of TTB-consistent choices between 'Agreement' trials (where TTB and WADD favor the same option) and 'Conflict' trials (where they favor opposing options). Because pure TTB's decision mechanism yields identical choice probabilities across all trials (its score vector is always [1, 0] or [0, 1]), its expected value for this difference is exactly 0. In contrast, the Strategy Mixture theory allows WADD to pull choices away from the TTB winner on conflict trials, making the TTB-consistency rate significantly lower on conflict trials than on agreement trials. Consequently, this difference will be strongly positive for Mixture and zero for pure TTB, providing a highly robust discriminator.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_4)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Strategy Mixture (TTB + WADD) theory from pure Take-The-Best (TTB), we use a 5-feature design with a linearly descending validity profile. Pure TTB relies solely on the most valid discriminating cue, treating all subsequent cues as irrelevant. The Mixture model, however, integrates a Weighted Additive (WADD) component, meaning the sum of lower-validity cues can pull choice probabilities away from the TTB prediction. By creating 'compensatory conflict' trials where the highest valid cue favors Option A but a coalition of lower valid cues heavily favors Option B, pure TTB predicts a strong preference for A (modulated only by general noise), while the Mixture model predicts a softened preference for A or even a preference for B. We vary the strength of the WADD counter-evidence to provide a fine-grained test of the mixture component.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates 'compensatory conflict' trials where the pure Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic strongly predicts choosing Option A (because the most valid discriminating cue favors A), while the Weighted Additive (WADD) component strongly favors Option B (because a coalition of lower-validity cues outvotes the single best cue). The pure TTB model will rarely choose B on these trials (only due to general noise), whereas the Strategy Mixture model will choose B significantly more often due to the compensatory influence of the WADD component. By computing the proportion of B choices specifically on these conflict trials, we obtain a sensitive measure that discriminates the two theories.

- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.

  "interpretation": "Across the six experiments, pure Take-The-Best (pi_3) consistently underpredicts the influence of lower-validity cues when they form a strong coalition against the most valid cue (e.g., Exp 2, Exp 6). However, the Strategy Mixture (pi_4) overpredicts the difference in consistency between agreement and conflict trials (Exp 1) and slightly misses the exact compensatory rate. The data suggest that subjects do not strictly follow pure TTB, nor do they simply mix TTB with WADD on a trial-by-trial basis. Instead, a mechanism where decision-makers accumulate evidence cue-by-cue in order of validity, but continue searching if the evidence difference is below a certain threshold, might better explain both the high TTB consistency and the occasional compensatory overrides.",

  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Threshold-based Sequential Search' theory. In this theory, cues are examined in descending order of validity. Instead of stopping at the very first discriminating cue (like pure TTB), the decision-maker maintains a running evidence tally (weighted by validity). If the absolute evidence difference exceeds an internal confidence threshold, search stops and a choice is made. If all cues are exhausted without reaching the threshold, the option with the higher accumulated evidence is chosen. This provides a natural integration of TTB-like fast stopping (if the top cue provides enough evidence on its own) and WADD-like compensatory behavior (if the threshold is high or top cues are weak)."
