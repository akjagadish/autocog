# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Propose a 'Threshold-based Sequential Search' theory. In this theory, cues are examined in descending order of validity. Instead of stopping at the very first discriminating cue (like pure TTB), the decision-maker maintains a running evidence tally (weighted by validity). If the absolute evidence difference exceeds an internal confidence threshold, search stops and a choice is made. If all cues are exhausted without reaching the threshold, the option with the higher accumulated evidence is chosen. This provides a natural integration of TTB-like fast stopping (if the top cue provides enough evidence on its own) and WADD-like compensatory behavior (if the threshold is high or top cues are weak).


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Threshold-based Sequential Search integrates the fast-and-frugal nature of Take-The-Best with the compensatory evidence accumulation of Weighted Additive (WADD) models. Decision-makers search through cues in descending order of their validity, maintaining a running tally of the evidence (weighted by each cue's validity). Instead of stopping at the very first discriminating cue, search terminates only when the absolute accumulated evidence exceeds an internal confidence threshold. If all cues are exhausted without reaching this threshold, the option with the higher accumulated evidence is chosen. This allows for fast, one-reason decisions when a highly valid cue strongly favors one option, while enabling compensatory behavior when early cues provide weak or conflicting evidence.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    
    # Sequential search with evidence accumulation
    for idx in order:
        diff = a[idx] - b[idx]
        evidence += diff * validities[idx]
        
        # Stop search if the confidence threshold is met or exceeded
        if abs(evidence) >= threshold:
            break
            
    # Convert accumulated evidence into discrete choice scores
    scores = np.zeros(2)
    if evidence > 0:
        scores[0] = 1.0
    elif evidence < 0:
        scores[1] = 1.0
        
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the scores
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Blend in uniform lapse
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- threshold: [0.0, 1.25]
- beta: [0.1, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.25]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Based on the critic's feedback, tightening the threshold to [0.0, 1.0] overcorrected and underpredicted compensatory behavior, while [0.0, 1.5] slightly overpredicted it. A middle-ground threshold range of [0.0, 1.25] gently balances fast-and-frugal stopping with compensatory accumulation. Additionally, reducing the maximum lapse rate (epsilon) to 0.25 prevents the model from relying on excessive uniform noise to fit the data.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4571 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2511 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.2525 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2422 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.2422.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Threshold-based Sequential Search model captures the basic premise but overestimates the compensatory (WADD-like) behavior across multiple experiments. For example, in Experiment 6, the proportion of B choices on conflict trials is 0.41 in the real data but 0.68 in the simulation. In Experiment 5, the difference between agreement and conflict matches is around 0 in reality but 0.41 in the simulation. This suggests the model is searching too exhaustively.
Rationale: The threshold parameter range [0.0, 5.0] is too wide. Given that validities typically sum to around 3.0-4.0, a threshold up to 5.0 almost guarantees exhaustive search on every trial, turning the model into a pure WADD model for a large portion of the parameter space. Narrow the threshold range to [0.0, 2.0] or [0.0, 1.5] so the model properly balances fast-and-frugal stopping with compensatory accumulation.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4571 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2511 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model narrowed the threshold range, which successfully improved the fit and reduced the overestimation of compensatory behavior (loss improved from 0.4571 to 0.2511). However, the model still over-predicts the degree of compensatory choices in several experiments. For instance, in Experiment 2, the observed metric is 0.1822, but the candidate produces 0.6444. In Experiment 5, the real value is near zero (-0.0185), while the candidate shows 0.2133. This suggests the model is still searching too many cues before making a decision, and the high upper bound on epsilon (0.5) might be flattening the choice probabilities too much.
Rationale: To further align with the empirical data, tighten the threshold parameter range even more to [0.0, 1.0]. Since cue validities typically range between 0.5 and 1.0, a threshold up to 1.5 still frequently requires integrating 2-3 cues, which is too compensatory. Additionally, reduce the upper bound of the epsilon (lapse rate) parameter to [0.0, 0.25] to prevent the model from relying on excessively high random guessing to fit the data.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2511 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.2525 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The previous suggestion to tighten the threshold to [0.0, 1.0] was REJECTED by the gate because it overcorrected. In Experiment 4, the real metric is 0.4006; the accepted base (iter 2) predicted 0.4706, but the tightened threshold in iter 3 pushed it down to 0.2428. Similarly, in Experiment 6, the real metric is 0.4147, the base predicted 0.4803, and iter 3 dropped to 0.2680. The threshold of 1.0 forces the model to be too fast-and-frugal, underpredicting compensatory behavior on conflict trials.
Rationale: Since tightening the threshold to [0.0, 1.0] overcorrected and was rejected, we should build on the accepted base (iter 2) and find a middle ground. Set the threshold parameter range to [0.0, 1.25], which splits the difference between iter 2's [0.0, 1.5] and iter 3's [0.0, 1.0]. Keep the epsilon (lapse rate) upper bound at 0.25 to prevent relying on excessive noise. This should gently reduce the over-prediction of compensatory behavior without causing the severe under-prediction seen in the rejected candidate.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.2525 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2422 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate has reached a strong balance across the experiments. The middle-ground threshold range of [0.0, 1.25] successfully captures the mixture of fast-and-frugal and compensatory behavior. Most notably, in Experiment 6, the candidate exactly matches the empirical metric (0.4157 vs real 0.4147). While there is still some overestimation in Experiment 2 and slight underestimation in Experiment 4, the aggregate loss has reached a new low (0.2422), and the model's behavior aligns well with the prescribed mechanism family.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The current threshold boundaries and epsilon limits have successfully tuned the Threshold-based Sequential Search model to fit the data well. The model perfectly balances early stopping and evidence accumulation on conflict trials (as seen in Experiment 6). No further minor adjustments are strictly necessary within this family; the candidate is good enough to proceed."
