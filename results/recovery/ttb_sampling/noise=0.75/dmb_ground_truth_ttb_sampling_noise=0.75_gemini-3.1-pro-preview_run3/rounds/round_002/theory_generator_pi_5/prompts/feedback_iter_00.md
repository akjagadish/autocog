# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Propose a 'Threshold-based Sequential Search' theory. In this theory, cues are examined in descending order of validity. Instead of stopping at the very first discriminating cue (like pure TTB), the decision-maker maintains a running evidence tally (weighted by validity). If the absolute evidence difference exceeds an internal confidence threshold, search stops and a choice is made. If all cues are exhausted without reaching the threshold, the option with the higher accumulated evidence is chosen. This provides a natural integration of TTB-like fast stopping (if the top cue provides enough evidence on its own) and WADD-like compensatory behavior (if the threshold is high or top cues are weak).


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Threshold-based Sequential Search integrates the fast-and-frugal nature of Take-The-Best with the compensatory evidence accumulation of Weighted Additive (WADD) models. Decision-makers search through cues in descending order of their validity, maintaining a running tally of the evidence (weighted by each cue's validity). Instead of stopping at the very first discriminating cue, search terminates only when the absolute accumulated evidence exceeds an internal confidence threshold. If all cues are exhausted without reaching this threshold, the option with the higher accumulated evidence is chosen. This allows for fast, one-reason decisions when a highly valid cue strongly favors one option, while enabling compensatory behavior when early cues provide weak or conflicting evidence.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort cues in descending order of validity
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    evidence = 0.0
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    
    # Sequential search with evidence accumulation
    for idx in order:
        diff = a[idx] - b[idx]
        evidence += diff * validities[idx]
        
        # Stop search if the confidence threshold is met or exceeded
        if abs(evidence) >= threshold:
            break
            
    # Convert accumulated evidence into discrete choice scores
    scores = np.zeros(2)
    if evidence > 0:
        scores[0] = 1.0
    elif evidence < 0:
        scores[1] = 1.0
        
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the scores
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Blend in uniform lapse
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- threshold: [0.0, 5.0]
- beta: [0.1, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's recommendation, this model implements a Threshold-based Sequential Search. It bridges the gap between pure Take-The-Best (which stops too early and misses compensatory effects) and full Weighted Additive models (which never stop early). By accumulating validity-weighted evidence and checking it against a threshold, the model can halt search when confidence is high but continue when cues conflict or are weakly informative. This mechanism parsimoniously captures both the fast-and-frugal lexicographic choices and the compensatory trade-offs observed in the data.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4571 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4571.

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Threshold-based Sequential Search model captures the basic premise but overestimates the compensatory (WADD-like) behavior across multiple experiments. For example, in Experiment 6, the proportion of B choices on conflict trials is 0.41 in the real data but 0.68 in the simulation. In Experiment 5, the difference between agreement and conflict matches is around 0 in reality but 0.41 in the simulation. This suggests the model is searching too exhaustively.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The threshold parameter range [0.0, 5.0] is too wide. Given that validities typically sum to around 3.0-4.0, a threshold up to 5.0 almost guarantees exhaustive search on every trial, turning the model into a pure WADD model for a large portion of the parameter space. Narrow the threshold range to [0.0, 2.0] or [0.0, 1.5] so the model properly balances fast-and-frugal stopping with compensatory accumulation."
