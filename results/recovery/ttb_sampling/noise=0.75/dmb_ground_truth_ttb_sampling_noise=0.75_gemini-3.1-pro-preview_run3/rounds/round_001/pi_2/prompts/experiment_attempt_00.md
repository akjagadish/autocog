## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended heuristics (e.g. TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every heuristic agrees, and prefer pairs that dissociate single-feature focus from feature-summing strategies. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities
- weights: [(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features

**`predict source code`:**

def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the

    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(

    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Take The Best (TTB) is a fast-and-frugal lexicographic heuristic for multi-attribute choice. Instead of integrating all available information (like WADD) or counting unweighted cues (like Tallying), decision-makers search through features in descending order of their validity. The search stops at the first cue that discriminates between the two options, and the option favored by that cue is chosen. If no cue discriminates, the decision-maker guesses. This non-compensatory mechanism allows for rapid choices that often match more complex compensatory rules in environments with dispersed cue validities. Response noise is higher than previously assumed, reflecting softer empirical choice rates.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 3.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.8]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort cues in descending order of validity
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    scores = np.zeros(2)
    
    # Lexicographic search: stop at the first discriminating cue
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            scores[0] = 1.0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            scores[1] = 1.0
            break
            
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the scores (which are either [1, 0], [0, 1], or [0, 0] if all tied)
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Blend in uniform lapse
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

```python
def policy(probabilities):

    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()

## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] To quantitatively dissociate Tallying from WADD, we use a 5-feature design with a skewed distribution of validities (two very high, three low). Tallying simply counts the number of features favoring each option, treating all features equally. WADD computes a weighted sum using the validities. By pitting an option (A) that wins on a small number of high-validity features against an option (B) that wins on a larger number of low-validity features, we create direct conflicts: Tallying prefers B due to the higher count of winning features, while WADD prefers A due to the higher cumulative validity of its fewer winning features. We also include pairs where the two heuristics agree or where Tallying predicts a tie but WADD predicts a strict preference, allowing us to estimate the noise parameters independently of the structural dissociation.

[1] To quantitatively dissociate WADD from Tallying, we use a 5-feature design with a steep drop-off in validities (two high, three low). Tallying counts the number of winning features irrespective of their validity, while WADD weights each feature by its validity. By pitting an option that wins on two high-validity features against one that wins on three low-validity features, we create a direct contradiction: Tallying prefers the option with three winning features, whereas WADD prefers the option with two high-validity features. We also include trials where Tallying predicts a tie but WADD predicts a strict preference, allowing for a precise estimation of choice noise and a robust comparison of the two models.

[2] To quantitatively dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from the Weighted Additive rule (WADD), we utilize a 5-feature design with a linearly decreasing set of validities. TTB processes features lexicographically, stopping at the most valid feature that discriminates between the two options. WADD, in contrast, integrates all features by computing a weighted sum. The key to dissociating them lies in 'compensatory' trials where the single most valid discriminating feature favors one option, but a coalition of less valid features favors the other option such that their combined weight exceeds the highest valid feature. We include trials where TTB and WADD strongly disagree (e.g., Option A wins on the highest validity cue only, while Option B wins on all remaining cues), trials where they agree (to anchor the noise parameters), and trials with ties on the top cue(s) to test TTB's reliance on secondary cues versus WADD's full-profile integration.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — heuristics that rely on validity-ordering re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) collapse WADD into a scaled Equal-Weight rule and make them indistinguishable by any decision.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended heuristics (TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) be dissociated; avoid trials where every heuristic agrees.
