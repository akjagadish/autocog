# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 9: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Strategy Mixture Model (TTB + Tallying) from TTB with Probabilistic Stopping, this design varies the total number of features favoring each option while holding the highest-validity discriminating feature constant across subsets of trials. Under the competing TTB model, the choice probability depends solely on the validity of the first discriminating feature, so trials with the same top discriminator will yield identical choice probabilities. In contrast, the advocated Mixture model integrates a Tallying component, meaning choice probabilities will systematically shift depending on how many total features favor the TTB-winning option versus the TTB-losing option.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Strategy Mixture Model (TTB and Tallying): Decision-makers exhibit heterogeneous strategy use, with the population consisting of a mix of Take-The-Best (TTB) users and Tallying users. Rather than a pure one-reason heuristic or a fully compensatory process, aggregate behavior reflects a probabilistic mixture. On any given trial, a subject's choice is a weighted blend of a lexicographic TTB process (which chooses based on the single most valid discriminating cue) and a Tallying process (which counts the number of feature-wise wins for each option). Allowing the mixture weight to vary freely between 0 and 1 across individuals captures the empirical finding that aggregate behavior is predominantly non-compensatory but softened by a subset of subjects who rely more heavily on compensatory tallying.

**Parameters:**
- beta_ttb: [0.0, 10.0]
- beta_tally: [0.0, 5.0]

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Take The Best (TTB) with Probabilistic Stopping: Decision-makers use a lexicographic heuristic, ranking features by subjective validity and stopping at the first discriminating feature. However, rather than making a strictly deterministic choice based on this feature, the decision is probabilistic. The probability of choosing the winning option scales with the validity of that discriminating feature via a softmax function with a highly regularized inverse temperature (beta). This allows confidence to vary depending on how valid the deciding feature is, capturing empirical noise without relying entirely on a global random lapse rate.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.0, 2.5]
- epsilon: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Rank features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    scores = np.array([0.0, 0.0])
    
    # Iterate through sorted features to find the first discriminator
    for f in order:
        if a[f] > b[f]:
            scores = np.array([validities[f], 0.0])
            break
        elif b[f] > a[f]:
            scores = np.array([0.0, validities[f]])
            break
            
    # If no feature discriminates, default to uniform guessing
    if scores[0] == scores[1]:
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        # Probabilistic choice scaling with the validity of the discriminating feature
        z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
        e = np.exp(z)
        p_core = e / e.sum()
        
    # Apply lapse rate
    n_opts = 2
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
