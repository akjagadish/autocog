# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a 'Probabilistic Cue Search' theory. Instead of a deterministic search order with probabilistic execution (like Theory 1) or a mixture with compensatory tallying (like Theory 2), this theory posits that decision-makers always use a strict one-reason heuristic but search through cues probabilistically. The probability of inspecting a cue next is proportional to its validity (e.g., a softmax over validities of uninspected cues). Once a discriminating cue is found, it deterministically dictates the choice. This maintains the purely non-compensatory nature of the decision process (aligning with the observed near-zero tallying effects) but introduces noise through variations in attention or memory retrieval, offering a strong, cognitively plausible competitor to Theory 1.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Probabilistic Cue Search: Decision-makers rely on a strict one-reason heuristic but search through cues probabilistically rather than in a fixed deterministic order. The probability of inspecting a cue is proportional to its subjective validity (via a softmax function). The decision-maker inspects cues one by one without replacement until a discriminating cue is found, which then deterministically dictates the choice. Mathematically (via the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives in the Plackett-Luce model), the probability that a specific discriminating cue is the first one encountered is exactly its softmax weight divided by the sum of the softmax weights of all discriminating cues. This preserves the non-compensatory nature of the process while introducing cognitively plausible noise through stochastic attention and memory retrieval.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])

    # Identify which cues discriminate between the two options
    disc = (a != b)
    
    if not np.any(disc):
        # If no cues discriminate, guess randomly
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        # Compute softmax weights for discriminating cues
        w = np.zeros_like(validities)
        max_v = np.max(validities[disc])
        w[disc] = np.exp(beta * (validities[disc] - max_v))
        
        sum_w = np.sum(w)
        
        # The probability of choosing an option is the sum of the weights 
        # of the discriminating cues that favor it, normalized by the sum
        # of weights of all discriminating cues.
        p_a = np.sum(w[a > b]) / sum_w
        p_b = np.sum(w[b > a]) / sum_w

    # Apply uniform lapse rate

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- beta: [1.0, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Applying the minimal edit suggested by the critic: restricting the range of `beta` to [1.0, 10.0]. The previous iteration's attempt to use [5.0, 30.0] made the model too deterministic, ruining the fits for Experiments 1-4. A moderate range of [1.0, 10.0] balances the need for low tallying effects in Exps 5-6 (by ensuring high-validity cues still dominate the softmax weights) with the probabilistic noise required to capture the variance in Exps 1-4.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3005 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3591 -> REJECTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2259 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.2259.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Probabilistic Cue Search model was successfully implemented and accepted as the new best model. However, it still exhibits substantial compensatory behavior (tallying effects) in Experiments 5 and 6 (simulated values ~0.25 vs. observed ~0.0). This happens because Plackett-Luce sampling makes the choice probability proportional to the sum of the weights of the discriminating cues. If the softmax temperature parameter (beta) is too low, a larger number of lower-validity cues favoring one option will sum up to a higher probability than a single high-validity cue, mathematically mimicking a compensatory tallying process.
Rationale: To capture the near-zero tallying effects observed in human data (Exp 5 & 6) while remaining within the prescribed Probabilistic Cue Search family, the model must sample the most valid cue with much higher probability. Restrict the parameter range of `beta` to higher values (e.g., [5.0, 30.0] instead of [0.0, 20.0]) to ensure the highest-validity cue dominates the softmax weights, thus preserving the strictly non-compensatory signature of the empirical data.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3005 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3591 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate implemented the previous advice to increase the softmax temperature beta to [5.0, 30.0]. While this successfully suppressed the compensatory tallying effects in Experiments 5 and 6 (bringing them closer to 0), it made the model far too deterministic. This severely degraded the fit on Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4, where the model produced overly extreme predictions compared to human data. As a result, the candidate's aggregate loss worsened and was rejected by the gate.
Rationale: Increasing beta to [5.0, 30.0] was rejected by the gate because it forced the model too close to strict deterministic Take-The-Best, ruining the fits for Exps 1-4. To balance the need for low tallying effects in Exps 5-6 with the probabilistic noise required for Exps 1-4, we need a more moderate parameter range. Set beta to a middle-ground range like [1.0, 10.0] (instead of the previous [0.0, 20.0] or [5.0, 30.0]). This will allow the softmax to emphasize high-validity cues enough to reduce tallying, while still preserving enough sampling noise to capture the variance in Exps 1-4. Keep the core Probabilistic Cue Search mechanism intact.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3591 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2259 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate model with the beta parameter range [1.0, 10.0] was successfully accepted, achieving the lowest aggregate loss so far (0.2259). This moderate range successfully balances the competing demands of the dataset. It prevents the model from becoming overly deterministic, yielding excellent fits for Experiments 1, 3, and 4 (which require some probabilistic noise). While it still produces mild tallying effects in Experiments 5 and 6 (around 0.25 vs observed ~0.0), this is an acceptable theoretical compromise within the Plackett-Luce formulation of the Probabilistic Cue Search family, as pushing beta higher to crush the tallying effect strictly ruins the fits on the other experiments (as seen in Iteration 2).",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The current parameter ranges ([1.0, 10.0] for beta) provide the best known trade-off between capturing the probabilistic variance in Exps 1-4 and minimizing the compensatory tallying effects in Exps 5-6. Further attempts to increase beta will likely result in rejection due to overfitting the deterministic nature of Exps 5-6 at the expense of the rest of the dataset. The core mechanism is faithful to the arbiter's recommendation and performs well. Ship it."
