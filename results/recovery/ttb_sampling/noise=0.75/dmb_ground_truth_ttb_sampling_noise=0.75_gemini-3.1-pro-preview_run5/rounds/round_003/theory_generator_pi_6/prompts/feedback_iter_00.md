# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a new theory based on Parallel Constraint Satisfaction or a Leaky Competing Accumulator. Unlike the rigid mixture of TTB and Tallying, or a strict sequential threshold search, a parallel accumulation model allows all features to be processed simultaneously but with weights that dynamically inhibit each other. This can naturally produce both lexicographic-like choices (when one feature's validity heavily inhibits the others) and compensatory choices (when multiple features collectively overcome a single strong feature), potentially capturing the varied choice probabilities across all 8 experiments.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) Decision Network. Choices emerge from a recurrent neural network where options and features bidirectionally interact. Options accumulate evidence from features and mutually inhibit each other. Crucially, options send feedback to features, amplifying features that support the leading option and suppressing those that oppose it. This coherence shift dynamically alters feature weights during the decision process, allowing the model to smoothly transition between compensatory (tallying-like) and non-compensatory (lexicographic) behavior depending on the initial evidence dynamics.

- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory implements a Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) model. Unlike rigid strategy mixtures or strict threshold searches, PCS allows all features to be processed simultaneously in a dynamic network. Options mutually inhibit each other (controlled by 'lam'), and crucially, they send feedback to the cues (controlled by 'gamma'). This feedback creates a 'coherence shift': if a highly valid cue gives an option an early lead, that option suppresses the opposing option and its supporting cues, producing lexicographic (TTB-like) choices. Conversely, if multiple lower-validity cues collectively outweigh a single strong cue early on, they will boost their option and suppress the strong cue, producing compensatory choices. This dynamic, self-organizing weighting naturally explains the variance across all 8 experiments.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3200 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3200.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate theory successfully implements the prescribed Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) network and establishes a solid baseline, leading to its acceptance. However, a detailed look at the experiments reveals a systematic bias: the model is currently too compensatory. It significantly overpredicts compensatory choices in Experiments 4 (0.75 vs 0.41) and 6 (0.62 vs 0.42), while underpredicting TTB-consistent choices in Experiment 3 (0.34 vs 0.60). This suggests that the sheer number of lower-validity cues is overwhelming the highest-validity cue before the 'coherence shift' (feedback from options to cues) can properly lock in the leading option.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "To reduce the over-reliance on compensatory tallying and boost TTB-like behavior when appropriate, the highest-validity cue needs a stronger initial advantage, and the coherence shift needs to act more decisively. Keep the PCS architecture, but make the following minor adjustments: 1) Introduce a non-linear transformation for the initial cue validities (e.g., `validities ** rho` where `rho` is a new free parameter) to allow the model to create steeper, more lexicographic-friendly initial weights. 2) Widen the parameter ranges for lateral inhibition (`lam`) and feedback (`gamma`) (e.g., up to 10.0) so that an early lead can more aggressively suppress competitors. 3) Expose the integration rate `alpha` as a free parameter rather than hardcoding it to 0.1, allowing the network to control the speed of the coherence shift relative to the 50 iterations."
