## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Probabilistic Strategy Selection (Mixture of TTB and Tallying)

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we implement a 'Mixture of Strategies' theory. The previous rank-decay model struggled because adjusting a single set of continuous weights caused it to overshoot on some experiments while trying to fit others. By instead modeling behavior as a probabilistic mixture between a pure lexicographic strategy (Take-The-Best) and a pure compensatory strategy (Tallying) on each trial, the model can natively capture the intermediate pooled metrics across all four experiments by balancing the `p_lex` parameter.

**Parameters:**
  - `p_lex`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    p_lex = float(parameters["p_lex"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Strategy 1: Take-The-Best (Lexicographic)
    order = np.argsort(-validities, kind='stable')
    scores_ttb = np.zeros(2)
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            scores_ttb[0] = 1.0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            scores_ttb[1] = 1.0
            break
            
    # Strategy 2: Tallying (Compensatory)
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores_tal = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    
    # Softmax for TTB
    z_ttb = beta * (scores_ttb - scores_ttb.max())
    e_ttb = np.exp(z_ttb)
    p_ttb = e_ttb / e_ttb.sum()
    
    # Softmax for Tallying
    z_tal = beta * (scores_tal - scores_tal.max())
    e_tal = np.exp(z_tal)
    p_tal = e_tal / e_tal.sum()
    
    # Mixture of strategies
    p_core = p_lex * p_ttb + (1.0 - p_lex) * p_tal
    
    # Uniform lapse blended into the mixture
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np

```


### slot 2 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Sequential Evidence Accumulation. Decision-makers inspect features sequentially in decreasing order of validity. At each step, the validity-weighted difference between the options' features is added to an accumulated evidence tally. If the absolute value of this accumulated evidence exceeds a critical threshold, search stops immediately and a decision is made based on the current tally (mimicking Take-The-Best when the threshold is low). If all features are exhausted without crossing the threshold, a choice is made probabilistically based on the final accumulated tally (mimicking compensatory strategies like Weighted Additive when the threshold is high).

**Rationale:** Reduced the upper bound of the threshold parameter from 2.0 to 1.5. Previous attempts to raise the threshold slightly worsened fits for Exps 4 and 6 by allowing too much compensatory search. Lowering the upper bound induces slightly more lexicographic early-stopping, which should pull down the overestimation in Exp 4 towards the empirical data without destroying the overall fit.

**Parameters:**
  - `threshold`: `[0.01, 1.5]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order (stable sort for ties)
    order = np.argsort(-validities, kind='stable')
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    evidence = 0.0
    
    # Sequential search and evidence accumulation
    for idx in order:
        diff = a[idx] - b[idx]
        evidence += validities[idx] * diff
        
        # Stop search if accumulated evidence exceeds the threshold
        if abs(evidence) >= threshold:
            break
            
    # Convert the final evidence into choice probabilities.
    # Evidence represents the accumulated advantage of Option A over Option B.
    scores = np.array([evidence, 0.0])
    
    # Softmax over the scores
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) Decision Network with Softmax Cue Weighting. Choices emerge from a recurrent neural network where options and features bidirectionally interact. Options accumulate evidence from features and mutually inhibit each other. Options also send feedback to features, amplifying features that support the leading option (coherence shift). To allow the model to flexibly transition between compensatory and non-compensatory (lexicographic) behavior without destabilizing the network, the initial cue validities are transformed via a softmax function controlled by a temperature parameter (tau). This ensures the highest-validity cue can decisively dominate the parallel accumulation when necessary, while bounded inhibition and feedback terms prevent runaway dynamics.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the previous power-law transformation destabilized the PCS network. To safely reduce the baseline model's over-reliance on compensatory tallying and enable stronger Take-The-Best (lexicographic) behavior, I introduced a softmax transformation over the validities controlled by a temperature parameter 'tau' ([0.0, 10.0]). This provides a bounded, mathematically stable way to interpolate between Tallying (tau -> 0) and TTB (tau -> high) by creating steeper initial weights for the highest-validity cues. I also restricted lateral inhibition ('lam') and feedback ('gamma') to more conservative ranges ([0.0, 2.0]) to prevent the runaway dynamics that caused the previous iteration to fail.

**Parameters:**
  - `tau`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `lam`: `[0.0, 2.0]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 2.0]`
  - `kappa`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
