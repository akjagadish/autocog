# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To strictly dissociate the Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) Decision Network from the Sequential Evidence Accumulation model, we exploit the PCS model's softmax transformation of cue validities. When the temperature parameter (tau) is low, PCS approaches an equal-weighting (Tallying) strategy, regardless of the original validity magnitudes. The Sequential Accumulator, however, searches in strict validity order and its predictions are mathematically bounded by Take-The-Best (at low thresholds) and Weighted Additive (at high thresholds). In the critical dissociation trials (e.g., Trial 1), Option B wins on the two highest-validity features, while Option A wins on the three lowest-validity features. Because the sum of the top two validities exceeds the sum of the bottom three, both TTB and WADD strongly favor Option B. Consequently, the Sequential Accumulator MUST predict Option B for any threshold. However, PCS with a low tau will predict Option A because it counts more supporting features (3 vs 2). This creates a strict qualitative dissociation.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) Decision Network with Softmax Cue Weighting. Choices emerge from a recurrent neural network where options and features bidirectionally interact. Options accumulate evidence from features and mutually inhibit each other. Options also send feedback to features, amplifying features that support the leading option (coherence shift). To allow the model to flexibly transition between compensatory and non-compensatory (lexicographic) behavior without destabilizing the network, the initial cue validities are transformed via a softmax function controlled by a temperature parameter (tau). This ensures the highest-validity cue can decisively dominate the parallel accumulation when necessary, while bounded inhibition and feedback terms prevent runaway dynamics.

**Parameters:**
- tau: [0.0, 10.0]
- lam: [0.0, 2.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 2.0]
- kappa: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Sequential Evidence Accumulation. Decision-makers inspect features sequentially in decreasing order of validity. At each step, the validity-weighted difference between the options' features is added to an accumulated evidence tally. If the absolute value of this accumulated evidence exceeds a critical threshold, search stops immediately and a decision is made based on the current tally (mimicking Take-The-Best when the threshold is low). If all features are exhausted without crossing the threshold, a choice is made probabilistically based on the final accumulated tally (mimicking compensatory strategies like Weighted Additive when the threshold is high).

**Parameters:**
- threshold: [0.01, 1.5]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order (stable sort for ties)
    order = np.argsort(-validities, kind='stable')
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    evidence = 0.0
    
    # Sequential search and evidence accumulation
    for idx in order:
        diff = a[idx] - b[idx]
        evidence += validities[idx] * diff
        
        # Stop search if accumulated evidence exceeds the threshold
        if abs(evidence) >= threshold:
            break
            
    # Convert the final evidence into choice probabilities.
    # Evidence represents the accumulated advantage of Option A over Option B.

**`policy source code`:**

def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- metric: Python source defining def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this metric; used when interpreting results.


## Response

```json
{
  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    # Calculate the total number of positive features for each option\n    sum_a = data['option_a_ratings'].apply(sum)\n    sum_b = data['option_b_ratings'].apply(sum)\n    \n    # Tallying prediction: choose the option with more positive features\n    # Returns 0 if A has more, 1 if B has more\n    tally_prediction = (sum_b > sum_a).astype(int)\n    \n    # Calculate the proportion of trials where the subject's response matches the Tallying prediction\n    return float((data['response'] == tally_prediction).mean())",
  "rationale": "This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with a simple Tallying strategy (choosing the option with the most positive features, regardless of feature validities). The PCS model, particularly at lower temperature (tau) values, naturally tends toward this equal-weighting behavior because the softmax transformation compresses the validity differences. In contrast, the Sequential Evidence Accumulation model is strictly bounded between Take-The-Best and Weighted Additive strategies. In the critical dissociation trials (e.g., Trial 1 and 2), the option with fewer features has the two highest-validity cues, making it the mathematically guaranteed choice for the Sequential Accumulator under any threshold. Therefore, the PCS model will produce a significantly higher proportion of Tallying-consistent choices overall compared to the Sequential Accumulator."
