# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Tallying (Equal Weight) theory posits that decision-makers simply count the number of positive features (or cues) for each option and choose the option with the higher tally, ignoring cue validities completely. This is a compensatory heuristic that treats all pieces of evidence equally.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, we replace Take The Best with the 'Tallying' (Equal Weight) theory. Tallying assumes that decision-makers do not weight cues by their validity, but rather just sum up the number of positive features for each option. This explains why subjects frequently choose the option with a higher total number of positive features (yielding a low value on the Experiment 1 metric) and why their choices strongly diverge from the Take The Best predictions (yielding a low value on the Experiment 2 metric). It serves as a strong, parameter-free (in terms of feature weights) compensatory alternative to WADD.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current trial
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    # Tallying: count the number of positive features for each option
    scores = np.sum(stim, axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Add uniform lapse rate
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_5` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking posits that decision-makers primarily rely on a compensatory equal-weight tallying heuristic, choosing the option with the highest number of positive features. However, when options are tied in their feature tallies, decision-makers do not guess randomly. Instead, they break the tie by comparing the options on the single most valid feature where the options differ (a Take-The-Best mechanism). This hybrid approach perfectly mimics Tallying on unequal feature counts but provides a deterministic, validity-based resolution for ties.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, we introduce a new parameter `w_tie` with a restricted upper bound of 0.05. Instead of adding 1.0 to the winner's score during a tie, we add `w_tie`. This drastically limits the maximum difference in softmax probabilities during tied trials, bringing the maximum expected score difference in Experiment 6 closer to the empirical ceiling of 0.5000, while preserving the deterministic fits on the primary tallying trials.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `w_tie`: `[0.0, 0.05]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features)")
        
    # Primary mechanism: Equal-weight tallying
    scores = np.sum(stim, axis=1)
    
    # Secondary mechanism: Lexicographic tie-breaking (Take-The-Best)
    if scores[0] == scores[1]:
        validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
        w_tie = float(parameters["w_tie"])
        diff = stim[0] - stim[1]
        valid_diffs = np.where(diff != 0)[0]
        
        if len(valid_diffs) > 0:
            # Find the differing feature with the highest validity
            best_feature = valid_diffs[np.argmax(validities[valid_diffs])]
            if diff[best_feature] > 0:
                scores[0] += w_tie
            else:
                scores[1] += w_tie

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Add uniform lapse rate
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) Model posits that decision-makers compute a fully compensatory weighted sum of features for each option. Unlike Tallying, which ignores cue validities, and Take-The-Best, which relies solely on the highest validity differing cue, WADD integrates all available information continuously by weighting each positive feature by its corresponding validity. The option with the highest overall weighted value is chosen.

**Rationale:** As per the arbiter's feedback, the previous model (Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking) systematically failed on tie trials because subjects simply guess rather than relying on the highest-validity differing feature. To provide a strong alternative baseline, we propose the classic Weighted Additive (WADD) model. WADD posits that subjects compute a fully compensatory weighted sum using the provided validities, integrating the cue validities continuously across all features instead of ignoring them or using them strictly for tie-breaking.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features)")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Weighted Additive mechanism: sum of features weighted by their validities
    # This assumes subjects use the raw validities as compensatory weights.
    scores = np.sum(stim * validities, axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Add uniform lapse rate
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
