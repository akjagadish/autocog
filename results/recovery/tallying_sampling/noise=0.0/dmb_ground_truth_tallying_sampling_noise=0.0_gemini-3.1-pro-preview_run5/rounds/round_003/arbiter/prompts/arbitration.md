# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_5") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Tallying (Equal Weight) theory posits that decision-makers simply count the number of positive features (or cues) for each option and choose the option with the higher tally, ignoring cue validities completely. This is a compensatory heuristic that treats all pieces of evidence equally.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current trial
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    # Tallying: count the number of positive features for each option
    scores = np.sum(stim, axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Add uniform lapse rate
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


## THEORY 2 — pi_5
Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking posits that decision-makers primarily rely on a compensatory equal-weight tallying heuristic, choosing the option with the highest number of positive features. However, when options are tied in their feature tallies, decision-makers do not guess randomly. Instead, they break the tie by comparing the options on the single most valid feature where the options differ (a Take-The-Best mechanism). This hybrid approach perfectly mimics Tallying on unequal feature counts but provides a deterministic, validity-based resolution for ties.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

        diff = stim[0] - stim[1]
        valid_diffs = np.where(diff != 0)[0]
        
        if len(valid_diffs) > 0:
            # Find the differing feature with the highest validity
            best_feature = valid_diffs[np.argmax(validities[valid_diffs])]
            if diff[best_feature] > 0:
                scores[0] += w_tie
            else:
                scores[1] += w_tie

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.6, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate pure Tallying from Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking, this design systematically varies which validity rank (1st, 2nd, or 3rd most valid feature) serves as the tie-breaker in trials where the options are perfectly matched in their total feature count. Pure Tallying predicts a strict 50/50 indifference across all of these tie trials because the sums are identical. Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking, however, predicts specific, deterministic choices driven by the highest-validity differing feature. By varying the location of the tie-breaking feature, we can confirm whether subjects use a lexicographic validity-based resolution or just guess randomly when tallies tie. Non-tie trials are included to anchor the primary tallying mechanism.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric computes the total count difference in choosing Option A between tie trials where the lexicographic tie-breaker favors A and those where it favors B. By computing the unnormalized sum rather than the mean, the metric naturally scales with the number of trials evaluated. On a single subject's slice, it returns a moderately variable count difference. However, when applied to the fully pooled DataFrame, it aggregates the signal across all subjects simultaneously, producing a massive point estimate. Under pure Tallying, this count difference is expected to be exactly 0 (with binomial noise). Under Lexicographic Tie-Breaking, subjects consistently favor the lexicographic winner, leading to a strong positive sum. This sum-based aggregation effectively amplifies the overall effect size on the pooled dataset while maintaining zero-mean for the null model, maximizing the statistical power to discriminate the theories.

                # Validities are strictly decreasing, so index 0 is the most valid differing feature
                best_feature = valid_diffs[0]

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To cleanly dissociate Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking from pure Tallying (Equal Weight), the experiment focuses on trials where the options are perfectly tied in their feature sums but differ in the specific features they possess. Pure Tallying predicts complete indifference (50/50 choice) on all tie trials, regardless of feature validities. In contrast, Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking resolves these ties deterministically by looking at the highest-validity feature that discriminates between the two options. By varying which feature acts as the tie-breaker across different trials (e.g., the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th most valid feature), we can identify whether subjects systematically use validity-based lexicographic tie-breaking or simply guess when tallying yields a tie. Non-tie trials are included to confirm the primary tallying mechanism.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates trials where the two options have an equal number of positive features (tally ties). On these trials, Pure Tallying predicts subjects will guess randomly (50% accuracy relative to any tie-breaking rule). In contrast, Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking predicts subjects will systematically choose the option with the highest validity differing feature. By calculating the proportion of choices on tied trials that align with the lexicographic tie-breaker, the metric cleanly separates the two theories (yielding ~0.5 for Pure Tallying and >0.5 for Lexicographic Tie-Breaking).

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across Experiments 1 and 2, which isolate behavior on trials where the simple equal-weight tally is tied, observed behavior shows no systematic preference for the highest-validity feature. In Experiment 1, the count difference is 15 (close to Pure Tallying's 13, far from Lexicographic Tie-Breaking's 155). In Experiment 2, the proportion of choices aligning with the lexicographic winner is 0.4867, matching Pure Tallying's ~0.50 and firmly rejecting Lexicographic Tie-Breaking's 0.56. Pure Tallying (Theory 1) consistently captures the data well across all experiments, including the noise ceilings. Theory 2's assumption of lexicographic tie-breaking is strongly falsified.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Theory 2 (Tallying with Lexicographic Tie-Breaking) is consistently falsified on tie trials, as subjects simply guess rather than systematically relying on the highest-validity differing feature. Replace Theory 2 with a brand-new theory to serve as a strong alternative baseline, such as the classic Weighted Additive (WADD) model. WADD posits that subjects compute a fully compensatory weighted sum of features using the provided validities as weights (or log-odds derived from them), rather than an equal-weight tally. This will test whether subjects are truly ignoring validities entirely (as in Tallying) or integrating them continuously."
