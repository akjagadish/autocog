# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Tallying (Equal Weight) theory posits that decision-makers simply count the number of positive features (or cues) for each option and choose the option with the higher tally, ignoring cue validities completely. This is a compensatory heuristic that treats all pieces of evidence equally.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current trial
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    # Tallying: count the number of positive features for each option
    scores = np.sum(stim, axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Add uniform lapse rate
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 9: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 10: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates Tallying (Equal Weight) from the Weighted Additive (WADD) model. Tallying simply counts the number of positive features, whereas WADD weights each feature by its validity. By pitting an option with a greater number of low-validity features against an option with fewer but much higher-validity features, we create strong opposite predictions. For example, an option with 3 low-validity features will be preferred by Tallying, while WADD will prefer the competing option possessing only 2 but highly valid features. Baseline agreement trials and trials where Tallying is indifferent but WADD shows a strong preference are also included.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates the critical trials where Tallying and WADD make diametrically opposed predictions. In these trials, one option has 3 low-validity features while the competing option has 2 high-validity features. Tallying simply counts features and strongly prefers the 3-feature option. WADD weighs features by validity and generally prefers the 2-feature option. The metric computes the proportion of choices that align with Tallying's prediction on these specific trials.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design systematically dissociates the compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) model from the Tallying (Equal Weight) heuristic. By carefully setting validities, we create specific trial types that pull apart the two models based on their core mechanisms: WADD weights features by validity, while Tallying simply counts positive features. The design includes trials where Tallying predicts a strict preference but WADD predicts exact indifference (e.g., one perfect validity cue vs. two lowest validity cues), trials where WADD predicts a strict preference but Tallying is indifferent (equal number of positive features but differing validities), and reversal trials where the two models predict strictly opposite choices.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The design includes a crucial reversal between Trial 2 (A=[1,1,0,0,0] vs B=[0,0,1,1,1]) and Trial 3 (A=[0,0,1,1,1] vs B=[1,1,0,0,0]). In Trial 2, Tallying counts 2 positive cues for A and 3 for B, thus predicting a preference for B. WADD, however, values the two highest-validity cues of A (1.0 + 0.8 = 1.8) more than the three lower-validity cues of B (0.6 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.6), predicting a preference for A. Trial 3 is the exact opposite. By computing the difference in the probability of choosing Option A between Trial 2 and Trial 3, we expect a strongly negative value for Tallying (which prefers B then A) and a strongly positive value for WADD (which prefers A then B).

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all four experiments, Theory 1 (Tallying / Equal Weight) overwhelmingly outperforms Theory 2 (Weighted Additive). In Experiment 1, subjects preferred the option with more features (ignoring validities) 82.89% of the time, perfectly matching Tallying's prediction (84.89%) and contradicting WADD (36.22%). In Experiment 2, the reversal metric yielded -0.7833, aligning with Tallying (-0.7400) and completely refuting WADD (0.2500). Experiments 3 and 4 further confirm this pattern, with Tallying's predictions exactly or almost exactly matching the observed data. The data strongly suggests that subjects are ignoring the provided validities and simply counting the number of positive cues. Since WADD is fundamentally misaligned with human behavior in this paradigm, it should be completely replaced.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a new theory to replace WADD. Since Tallying is exceptionally accurate, a strong competitor might be 'Threshold Tallying' (where subjects only tally cues whose validity exceeds a certain subjective threshold, ignoring the rest) or 'Probabilistic Tallying' (where cues are tallied but with a probability of being dropped). Alternatively, propose 'Take The Best' (TTB) as a pure non-compensatory baseline to formally rule out lexicographic processing, even though Experiment 4 already suggests TTB is not the primary strategy."
