# generation_iter_03_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a 'Weighted Additive Strategy' (WADD). Unlike Tallying (which gives equal weight to all positive features) and Thresholded Counting (which applies equal weights but filters by a threshold), WADD posits that subjects compute a weighted sum of the positive features for each option, where the weights are directly proportional to the features' provided validities. This will test whether subjects are sensitive to the continuous spectrum of cue validities in a fully compensatory manner.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.986)

**Description**
Thresholded Counting: People make decisions by counting the number of positive features for each option, but they only consider features that are deemed sufficiently reliable. Specifically, they ignore features whose subjective or objective validity falls below a certain threshold. For the features that pass this threshold, individuals simply tally the positive cues (equal weighting) and choose the option with the higher count. This bounded-rationality heuristic combines the simplicity of Tallying with a minimal form of validity sensitivity, filtering out noisy or low-information cues before applying a non-compensatory counting strategy.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.977)

**Description**
People use a Tallying (Equal Weights) strategy to make decisions when faced with multiple cues. Instead of weighting cues by their validities or relying solely on the single most valid cue, individuals simply sum the number of positive features for each option and choose the one with the highest total count. This non-weighted compensatory approach favors coalitions of numerous lower-validity cues over a single high-validity cue.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.623)

**Description**
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.2758 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.5142 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.6826 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2758 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Weighted Additive Strategy (WADD): Individuals compute a compensatory weighted sum of the positive features for each option, where the weight of each feature is directly proportional to its provided validity. Unlike heuristics that ignore validity differences (Tallying) or use them only for thresholding, WADD integrates the continuous spectrum of cue validities directly into the option values, allowing a large number of less valid cues to compensate for a single highly valid cue, and vice versa.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Weighted Additive Strategy: weights are directly proportional to validities
    # The scaling factor is absorbed by the beta parameter in the softmax.
    scores = stim @ validities
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory implements a pure Weighted Additive Strategy (WADD) where the subjective weights are strictly proportional to the provided objective validities. Unlike the previous pi_2 which fit an independent free parameter for every feature weight, this model uses zero free parameters for the weights themselves, relying entirely on the given validities. This directly tests the hypothesis that subjects are sensitive to the continuous spectrum of cue validities in a fully compensatory manner, without overfitting to sample noise via unconstrained per-feature weight parameters.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate implements a pure Weighted Additive Strategy (WADD) where weights exactly equal the provided cue validities. While this captures some variance, it fails significantly on Experiments 3 and 4. In Experiment 3, subjects strongly choose the option with the higher count of positive features (real = 0.84), whereas WADD predicts near-chance (0.47). In Experiment 4, subjects prefer an option with 3 lower-validity cues over one with 2 higher-validity cues (real = 0.14), but WADD strongly predicts the opposite (0.68). This indicates that subjects are not weighting the features as extremely as the raw objective validities suggest.
Rationale: To capture the empirical data while remaining strictly within the prescribed WADD family, the model needs a way to moderate the impact of the raw validities. Introduce a non-linear scaling parameter for the weights, such as a power-law transformation `weights = validities ** gamma` (with `gamma` ranging from e.g., 0.0 to 5.0). A `gamma` < 1 will compress the validities, flattening the weight distribution. This minor adjustment allows the WADD model to naturally span the spectrum from pure WADD (`gamma` = 1) to equal-weighting (`gamma` = 0), allowing it to fit the observed compensatory behavior where subjects under-weight the validities compared to objective probabilities.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2758 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.5142 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The introduction of the `gamma` exponent for non-linear validity scaling worsened the model's fit across the board, particularly on Experiments 3 and 4, leading to rejection by the accept gate. The power-law compression likely distorted the relative importance of the cues too much, moving predictions away from human behavior rather than towards it.
Rationale: Since the `gamma` parameter approach was rejected, we should abandon the power-law transformation. Instead, a more principled and standard way to use validities in a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy is to convert the raw validities (probabilities) into log-odds. Instruct the proposer to remove the `gamma` parameter and compute the weights as `weights = np.log(validities / (1.0 - validities))`. This log-odds transformation is mathematically grounded (equivalent to Naive Bayes) and often naturally captures the correct compensatory weighting without needing an extra free parameter.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.5142 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.6826 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The log-odds transformation in the current iteration significantly worsened the fit and was rejected by the gate. Log-odds expands the differences between high and low validities (e.g., making high validities exponentially more important), which pushes the model towards non-compensatory behavior. However, the data from Experiments 3 and 4 clearly show subjects behaving in a highly compensatory manner, closer to equal-weighting (Tallying). The prior attempt to fix this using a power-law `gamma` (iteration 2) also failed, likely because the wide range [0.0, 5.0] allowed the optimizer to select values > 1, which similarly expanded rather than compressed the weights.
Rationale: To capture the human tendency to flatten cue validities (under-weighting objective differences) while remaining safely within the WADD family, we must guarantee weight compression. Instead of log-odds or an unbounded power-law, introduce a linear mixing parameter `alpha` with a strict range of `[0.0, 1.0]`. Compute the weights as an interpolation between the raw validities and equal weights: `weights = alpha * validities + (1 - alpha) * 1.0`. This provides a bounded, stable knob that allows the model to smoothly span from pure WADD (alpha=1) to pure Tallying (alpha=0), directly addressing the failures in Experiments 3 and 4 without risking the divergence seen in previous iterations.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.6826 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
