# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
People make decisions using a 'Tallying' or 'Equal Weight' heuristic. Instead of weighting features by their validity or importance, decision-makers simply count the total number of positive features for each option. They choose the option with the highest tally, effectively ignoring the provided cue validities. This explains why participants consistently choose options with more positive cues even when a single higher-validity cue points in the opposite direction.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    # Tallying: sum the positive features for each option, ignoring validities.
    scores = stim.sum(axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax.
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Weighted Additive (WADD) Model. Decision-makers compute a weighted sum of the positive features for each option, using the provided cue validities as weights. They then choose the option with the higher weighted sum. This serves as a strong compensatory, rational baseline to rigorously test whether participants are partially or fully integrating validities, as opposed to ignoring them (Tallying) or using a non-compensatory rule (Take The Best).

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # WADD: sum of validities for positive features
    scores = stim @ validities
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.8, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Tallying (Equal Weight) from the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule, we design a 6-feature environment with a carefully constructed validity distribution: [0.95, 0.85, 0.80, 0.60, 0.55, 0.50]. This specific set of validities allows us to create a unique 'WADD tie' condition where the sum of validities for two features (0.85 + 0.80 = 1.65) exactly equals the sum of validities for three features (0.60 + 0.55 + 0.50 = 1.65). In this trial, WADD is completely indifferent, whereas Tallying shows a strict preference for the option with three features. We also include strong dissociation trials where an option with 4 lower-validity features is pitted against an option with 3 higher-validity features, causing diametrically opposed predictions between the two models. These conditions, alongside Tally-tie trials where WADD has a strict preference, provide a comprehensive map of the strategy space without relying on the structures of previously explored 5-feature or 7-feature designs.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with the Tallying (Equal Weight) heuristic on trials where Tallying's predictions diverge sharply from the Weighted Additive (WADD) model. Specifically, it targets Trials 2 and 3, which are uniquely identified by the sum of features for option A being exactly 1 greater than option B. In these trials, Tallying strictly prefers A, but WADD strictly prefers B (due to the higher validities of B's fewer features). By measuring the rate of choosing A on these critical dissociation trials, the metric produces a value close to 1.0 for agents using Tallying, and a much lower value for agents relying on WADD.

    mask = (sum_a - sum_b) == 1
    if mask.sum() == 0:
        return 0.5
    return float((data.loc[mask, 'response'] == 0).mean())

- Predicted under pi_6 (simulated): 0.3344 (var=0.0157)
- Observed on real data: 0.8550 (var=0.0125)

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_6)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=8):** [0.99, 0.95, 0.9, 0.51, 0.51, 0.51, 0.51, 0.51]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Tallying (Equal Weight) from the Weighted Additive (WADD) model, we introduce an 8-feature environment with a sharp step-down in cue validities: three highly valid cues (0.99, 0.95, 0.90) and five low-validity cues (all 0.51). This structure provides enough features to create stark contrasts between the quantity of positive cues and their weighted sum. We construct strong dissociation trials where WADD chooses an option with fewer but highly valid cues (e.g., 3 cues summing to 2.84), while Tallying chooses the alternative with more but less valid cues (e.g., 5 cues summing to 2.55). We also include 'Tally tie' trials where both options have the same number of positive features but different validity sums, forcing WADD to express a strict preference while Tallying is indifferent.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times the subject chooses Option A on critical dissociation trials. These are trials where Option B has a higher total number of positive features (favored by Tallying) but Option A has a higher weighted sum based on cue validities (favored by WADD). The WADD model predicts a high value for this metric (close to 1), whereas the Tallying model predicts a low value (close to 0).

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across almost all experiments, Theory 1 (Tallying) provides incredibly accurate predictions of the observed data, whereas Theory 2 (WADD) completely fails on critical dissociation trials (e.g., Exp 1, Exp 2, Exp 5, and Exp 6). The data strongly suggest that subjects are ignoring the cue validities and simply counting the number of positive features for each option. Theory 2's assumption of strict compensatory weighting by validity is consistently falsified. Therefore, Theory 2 should be replaced with a new theory that can serve as a more plausible alternative or boundary condition to Tallying.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose the 'Take-The-Best' (TTB) heuristic as the new Theory 2. TTB is a classic non-compensatory model that searches through features in descending order of their validity and stops at the first feature that discriminates between the two options, choosing the option with the positive feature. This will contrast sharply with Tallying (which integrates all features equally but ignores validities) and WADD (which integrates all features weighted by validities), providing a rigorous test of whether subjects use non-compensatory stopping rules in certain environments."
