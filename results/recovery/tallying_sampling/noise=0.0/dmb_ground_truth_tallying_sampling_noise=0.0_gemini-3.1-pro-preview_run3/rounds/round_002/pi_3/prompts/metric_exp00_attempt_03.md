# metric_exp00_attempt_03

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** While Tallying and Majority of Confirming Dimensions (MCD) produce identical relative score differences for two-option binary-feature choices (since shared features cancel out in both tally differences and MCD score differences), we can test if the presence of shared positive features alters decision noise or reaction times in ways not captured by the basic softmax rule. This design varies the number of shared '1's between options while keeping the number of unique '1's constant, allowing us to observe if subjects process holistic sums (Tallying) differently than pure dimension-wise comparisons (MCD) when cognitive load changes.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Tallying (Equal Weight Heuristic): People compare two options by ignoring the explicit validities of the cues and simply counting the number of positive features (or cues present) for each option. The option with the higher count (tally) is chosen. This is a strongly compensatory strategy that avoids the cognitive overhead of multiplying features by validities, yet allows multiple lower-validity cues to jointly overrule a single high-validity cue.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Tallying expects a (2, n_features) state.")
        
    # Tallying: simple sum of positive cues per option
    scores = stim.sum(axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over tally scores
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Majority of Confirming Dimensions (MCD): People make decisions by comparing options dimension by dimension rather than computing holistic values. On each feature, the option with the superior value earns a point (a 'confirming dimension'). The option with the most points across all features is chosen. For binary features, this dimension-wise comparison yields the same relative preference as Tallying, but through a fundamentally different cognitive process (pairwise comparisons rather than independent counting).

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("MCD expects a (2, n_features) state.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # MCD: Count how many features strictly favor each option
    score_a = np.sum(a > b)
    score_b = np.sum(b > a)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b], dtype=float)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over MCD scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
[0] rationale: For binary features, the difference in the number of positive features between two options (Tallying) is mathematically identical to the difference in the number of strictly confirming dimensions (MCD). Because both models apply the exact same softmax transformation and uniform lapse to these identical differences, they produce the exact same trial-by-trial choice probabilities. Therefore, their simulated data distributions are identical. This metric computes the overall choice proportion of Option B.
metric_source:
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # Since Tallying and MCD are mathematically identical for binary features in terms of choice probabilities
    # (as sum(A) - sum(B) == sum(A>B) - sum(B>A) always holds), their simulated data distributions are identical.
    # We simply compute the proportion of times Option B was chosen.
    return float(data['response'].mean())
outcome: self_sim=0.3704 (var=0.0026) adversary_sim=0.3792 (var=0.0027) welch_t=-0.600 p=0.551 (N=25, alpha=0.01) -> reject

[1] rationale: Since Tallying and MCD are mathematically identical for binary features, their simulated datasets are drawn from the exact same distributions. This metric isolates trials where Option A is objectively superior under both models (having more positive features, and thus more confirming dimensions) and calculates the accuracy. While it may not significantly discriminate the models if they are simulated with identical parameter priors, it captures the core construct of both theories.
metric_source:
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # Both models produce mathematically identical probabilities for binary features.
    # We compute the choice proportion for Option A on trials where Option A has more positive features.
    def count_ones(x):
        return sum(1 for v in x if v == 1)
    
    data['a_sum'] = data['option_a_ratings'].apply(count_ones)
    data['b_sum'] = data['option_b_ratings'].apply(count_ones)
    
    mask = data['a_sum'] > data['b_sum']
    if not mask.any():
        return 0.5
    
    return float((1 - data.loc[mask, 'response']).mean())
outcome: self_sim=0.8450 (var=0.0108) adversary_sim=0.8400 (var=0.0135) welch_t=+0.160 p=0.8732 (N=25, alpha=0.01) -> reject

[2] rationale: As demonstrated by algebraic equivalence, for any two binary vectors A and B, the difference in their sums (Tallying) is perfectly identical to the difference in their strictly confirming dimensions (MCD). Since both models apply a translation-invariant softmax to these scores, they yield identical choice probabilities for all possible binary trials. Any observed difference in simulation is pure sampling error, making reliable discrimination impossible.
metric_source:
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # Mathematically, Tallying and MCD are completely identical for binary choices.
    # Their choice probabilities on every single trial in this design are exactly the same.
    # Therefore, no metric can reliably distinguish them beyond random sampling noise.
    # We simply return the mean response.
    return float(data['response'].mean())
outcome: self_sim=0.3704 (var=0.0026) adversary_sim=0.3792 (var=0.0027) welch_t=-0.600 p=0.551 (N=25, alpha=0.01) -> reject
