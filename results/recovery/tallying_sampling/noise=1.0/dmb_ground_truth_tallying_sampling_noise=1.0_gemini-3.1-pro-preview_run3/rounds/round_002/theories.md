# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Probabilistic Cue Selection (Random Cue) posits that decision-makers do not deterministically use the most valid cue (like Take-The-Best) nor do they integrate all cues simultaneously (like WADD). Instead, on each trial, they sample a single cue with a probability proportional to its subjective validity. They then choose the option favored by that sampled cue, guessing uniformly if the sampled cue ties. This single-cue sampling process naturally generates probabilistic choices across trials, producing choice shares near 0.50 for conflict trials where different cues favor different options, without relying on extreme softmax noise.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this Probabilistic Cue Selection theory models decision-making as drawing a single cue per trial from a distribution proportional to subjective validities. By marginalizing over the possible sampled cues, it natively predicts intermediate choice probabilities without relying on a softmax temperature parameter. This perfectly aligns with the ~0.50 choice shares observed on conflict trials, as the probability of selecting an option becomes a linear mixture of the cues that support it, rather than a deterministic winner-takes-all or exponentially scaled WADD score.

**Parameters:**
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    n_features = stim.shape[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    
    # Subjective validities used as sampling weights
    subj_weights = val * w
    sum_w = np.sum(subj_weights)
    
    if sum_w <= 1e-9:
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        p_cue = subj_weights / sum_w
        a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
        
        p_a = 0.0
        for j in range(n_features):
            if a[j] > b[j]:
                p_a += p_cue[j]
            elif a[j] == b[j]:
                p_a += p_cue[j] * 0.5
                
        p_core = np.array([p_a, 1.0 - p_a])
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_4` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Equal Weights (Tallying)

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the model retains the binary tally winner mechanism from the last accepted iteration. However, to better match the highly noisy human data (which hovers near 0.5 across most metrics) and prevent the parameter fitting from finding overly deterministic regimes, the parameter ranges have been drastically restricted. Beta is now constrained to [0.0, 3.0] and epsilon is widened to [0.0, 1.0], forcing the model to be much more stochastic.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 3.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    
    # Count the number of positive features for each option
    tally_a = np.sum(stim[0])
    tally_b = np.sum(stim[1])
    
    if tally_a > tally_b:
        scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif tally_b > tally_a:
        scores = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        # Guess randomly if there is a tie
        return np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the binary tally score
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Independent lapse
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Weighted Additive Model (WADD) with Subjective Validities: Decision-makers integrate all available features by computing a weighted sum of cue values for each option. The weights are subjective validities, modeled as a power transformation of the objective validities. Choices are made probabilistically using a softmax function over the options' weighted sums, along with an independent lapse rate. Limiting the softmax inverse temperature ensures higher decision noise, which tempers overconfidence when cue validities conflict.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we keep the identical WADD mechanism with the power-law validity transformation and lapse rate, but further restrict the 'beta' parameter range to [0.0, 1.0]. This minimal edit enforces an even higher baseline of softmax noise, which should help to further suppress the remaining overprediction of accuracy in Experiments 4 and 6, bringing the predictions closer to the near-random human behavior observed on these specific trial types.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Transform objective validities into subjective weights
    subj_weights = validities ** gamma
    
    # Compute WADD scores
    scores = stim @ subj_weights
    
    # Softmax over scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Incorporate lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```
