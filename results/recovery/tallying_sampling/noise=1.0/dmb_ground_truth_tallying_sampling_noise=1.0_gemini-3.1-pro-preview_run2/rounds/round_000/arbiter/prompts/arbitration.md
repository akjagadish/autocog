# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design systematically pits Take The Best (TTB) against Weighted Additive (WADD) by creating 'compensatory' environments where the most valid discriminating cue points to option A, but a coalition of less valid cues points to option B. TTB relies solely on the highest-validity discriminating cue and will consistently choose A in these critical trials. In contrast, WADD integrates all features weighted by their validities, allowing the sheer number of lower-validity cues favoring B to outweigh the single high-validity cue favoring A. We also include non-compensatory trials where both models agree, ensuring that differences in model fit are driven by the specific cue-conflict structure rather than mere noise or random responding.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design systematically pits TTB against WADD by including 'compensatory' trials where Option A has the single highest-validity discriminating cue, but Option B has a greater total number of positive cues. By isolating the trials where the sum of Option B's features exceeds Option A's, we can measure the rate at which subjects choose Option B. Take The Best (TTB) ignores the sheer number of cues and will consistently pick Option A (metric ~ 0). Weighted Additive (WADD) integrates all cues, allowing the coalition of Option B's cues to outvote Option A's single strong cue, leading to a much higher rate of choosing B.

Source:
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # Calculate the total number of positive cues for each option
    sum_a = data['option_a_ratings'].apply(sum)
    sum_b = data['option_b_ratings'].apply(sum)
    
    # Identify critical compensatory trials where Option B has more positive cues overall,
    # but Option A possesses the single most valid discriminating cue.
    mask = sum_b > sum_a
    
    if not mask.any():
        return 0.0
        
    # Return the proportion of times the subject chose Option B (response == 1)
    # TTB will consistently choose A (yielding ~0.0) because it only looks at the top valid cue.
    # WADD will frequently choose B (yielding a higher value) because the numerous lower-validity cues compensate.
    return float(data.loc[mask, 'response'].mean())


### RESULTS
- Predicted under pi_1 (simulated): 0.1519 (var=0.0070)
- Predicted under pi_2 (simulated): 0.7075 (var=0.0196)
- Observed on real data: 0.4961 (var=0.0021)

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design systematically contrasts Weighted Additive (WADD) and Take The Best (TTB) by varying the distribution of less valid cues when the single most valid cue favors one option. In TTB, only the top discriminating cue dictates the choice, so the subject will consistently choose the option with the highest validity advantage. WADD, on the other hand, integrates all cues according to their validity weights. By creating 'compensatory' trials where the option lacking the highest-validity cue is supported by multiple lower-validity cues, we can produce stark opposite predictions between the two models. Non-compensatory trials are included as controls to ensure baseline adherence to cue validities.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In all 8 trials of the design, the first discriminating cue (highest validity) favors Option A. Therefore, TTB predicts Option A (response=0) on 100% of the trials, modulo noise. On the other hand, Option B is designed to have multiple lower-validity cues that compensate for the lack of the top cue, meaning WADD predicts Option B (response=1) on the vast majority of trials. The overall mean of the 'response' column captures this stark divergence directly and stably.

Source:
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # The experimental design is set up such that Take The Best (TTB) almost
    # always chooses option A (response = 0) because option A always has the
    # advantage on the single most valid discriminating cue.
    # Conversely, Weighted Additive (WADD) will frequently choose option B 
    # (response = 1) because option B has a large number of lower-validity 
    # cues that cumulatively outweigh option A's single best cue.
    # Thus, the simple overall proportion of choosing option B perfectly 
    # discriminates the two theories.
    return float(data['response'].mean())

### RESULTS
- Predicted under pi_1 (simulated): 0.1487 (var=0.0133)
- Predicted under pi_2 (simulated): 0.5729 (var=0.0092)
- Observed on real data: 0.4996 (var=0.0028)

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Both experiments focus on compensatory trials where the highest-validity cue points to Option A, but a coalition of lower-validity cues points to Option B. Take The Best (pi_1) predicts near 0% choice of B, while Weighted Additive (pi_2) predicts a high rate of choosing B (70% and 57%). The observed data in both experiments is remarkably close to 0.50 with very low between-subject variance, indicating that subjects are consistently choosing B about half the time on these conflict trials. Neither TTB (which strongly favors A) nor WADD (which strongly favors B) accurately captures this exact 50/50 split. The low variance suggests this isn't a mixture of extreme TTB and WADD subjects, but rather that individuals are genuinely indifferent or using a strategy that yields a tie on these trials.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Tallying' (Equal Weights) theory to replace TTB. Tallying simply counts the number of positive features for each option, ignoring cue validities completely. Alternatively, propose a 'Random Guessing / High Noise' baseline theory, as the empirical data is hovering exactly around 0.50 across all these carefully constructed compensatory trials. A Tallying model with moderate noise might better capture the flat sensitivity to validity weights."
