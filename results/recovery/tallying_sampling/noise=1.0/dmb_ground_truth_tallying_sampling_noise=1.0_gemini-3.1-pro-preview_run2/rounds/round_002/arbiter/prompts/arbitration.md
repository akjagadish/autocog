# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Tallying (Equal Weights) Theory with High Noise: People often ignore the varying validities or importances of different pieces of information, instead simply counting the number of positive features (or cues) favoring each option. However, when faced with difficult compensatory tradeoffs where one option has the best cue but the other has many weaker cues, subjects may experience high decision conflict and rely heavily on guessing. Thus, the choice process is characterized by a high degree of noise, pulling choice probabilities very close to chance (0.50).

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Convert stimulus to a numpy array of shape (2, n_features)
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    
    # Tallying rule: sum the unweighted positive features for each option
    scores = stim.sum(axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the tallied scores with max-subtraction for stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse (guessing) distribution
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    p_final = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
    
    return p_final

    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs = probs / probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


## THEORY 2 — pi_4
Take The Best (TTB) with Extreme Noise Theory: People use a non-compensatory 'one-reason' decision heuristic, comparing options by consulting cues one at a time in order of descending validity. The first cue that discriminates between the options determines the choice, and lower-validity cues are ignored. However, subjects experience extreme decision conflict or distraction, leading to a very high lapse rate (guessing) that pulls choice probabilities almost entirely toward chance (0.50), masking the underlying deterministic TTB process in aggregate data.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

    p_final = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
    
    return p_final

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design pits Tallying against Take The Best (TTB) by systematically varying the number of positive features versus the presence of the highest-validity discriminating feature. In these trials, the option with the single highest-validity discriminating cue (favored by TTB) always has fewer total positive cues than the alternative (favored by Tallying). Because the advocated theory (Tallying with High Noise) predicts choices driven by the unweighted sum of features, it will predict preferences for the option with more positive cues, albeit with small margins due to high noise. In contrast, the competing theory (TTB with Extreme Noise) predicts preferences in the exact opposite direction based strictly on the highest-validity cue, though also heavily regressed toward chance.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In all chosen trials, the option favored by Tallying (having more total positive cues) is strictly opposite to the option favored by TTB (having the highest-validity discriminating cue). This metric calculates the proportion of trials where the subject's choice aligns with the Tallying prediction. The advocated Tallying theory, despite high noise, will yield a mean > 0.5. The competing TTB theory, despite extreme noise, systematically favors the opposite option and will yield a mean < 0.5.

    tally_prediction = (sum_b > sum_a).astype(int)
    return float((data['response'] == tally_prediction).mean())

### RESULTS
- Predicted under pi_3 (simulated): 0.5390 (var=0.0042)
- Predicted under pi_4 (simulated): 0.4765 (var=0.0029)
- Observed on real data: 0.4992 (var=0.0026)

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_4)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55, 0.51]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design systematically dissociates Take The Best (TTB) with Extreme Noise from Tallying with High Noise using 6 features. By constructing trials where the single highest-validity discriminating cue points to one option while the sheer number of positive cues points to the other, we force the two theories to predict preferences in opposite directions. Because both theories predict high noise (choices near 0.50), the key dissociation lies in the *direction* of the slight deviations from chance. TTB will consistently lean toward the option with the highest-validity discriminating cue, whereas Tallying will lean toward the option with the higher unweighted sum of positive features. We also include a trial where Tallying predicts a perfect tie (equal number of positive features) but TTB predicts a strict preference, further distinguishing the underlying mechanisms.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of trials where the subject's choice aligns with the prediction of the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic. Because the experimental design systematically pits TTB against Tallying (by having the single most valid cue point in the opposite direction of the simple majority of positive cues), the TTB model will yield an alignment score slightly above 0.50 (due to extreme noise). Conversely, the Tallying model will yield an alignment score well below 0.50, as it systematically prefers the opposite option. This strong directional divergence ensures a robust discrimination between the two theories despite the high levels of noise in both.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all experiments, the observed metrics hover extremely close to 0.50 (e.g., 0.4992, 0.5071, 0.4961, 0.4996, 0.5065). While both Theory 1 (Tallying) and Theory 2 (Take The Best) attempt to capture this by positing high or extreme noise, they still predict systematic deviations from 0.50 that are not borne out by the real data. For instance, in Experiment 1, pi_3 predicts 0.539 and pi_4 predicts 0.476, but the observed is 0.499. In Experiment 2, pi_3 predicts 0.432 and pi_4 predicts 0.515, while observed is 0.507. The data strongly suggest that subjects are either completely guessing or using a perfectly balanced compensatory strategy (like Weighted Additive with specific weights) that cancels out the cues in these adversarial designs. Given that TTB (pi_4) is slightly closer in some experiments, Tallying (pi_3) is a good candidate for replacement.",

  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Random Choice (Pure Guessing) Theory' or a 'Weighted Additive (WADD) with Extreme Noise Theory'. If subjects find the fictitious validities too difficult to integrate, they might resort to pure guessing, making choices completely randomly. Alternatively, a WADD model that linearly weights cues by their provided validities combined with a very high lapse rate might perfectly balance the conflicting cues in these specific experimental designs, resulting in exactly 0.50 predictions without relying on a non-compensatory heuristic like TTB."
