## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended heuristics (e.g. TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every heuristic agrees, and prefer pairs that dissociate single-feature focus from feature-summing strategies. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities
- weights: [(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Tallying (Equal Weights) Theory with High Noise: People often ignore the varying validities or importances of different pieces of information, instead simply counting the number of positive features (or cues) favoring each option. However, when faced with difficult compensatory tradeoffs where one option has the best cue but the other has many weaker cues, subjects may experience high decision conflict and rely heavily on guessing. Thus, the choice process is characterized by a high degree of noise, pulling choice probabilities very close to chance (0.50).

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.0, 0.5]
- epsilon: [0.2, 1.0]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Convert stimulus to a numpy array of shape (2, n_features)
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    
    # Tallying rule: sum the unweighted positive features for each option
    scores = stim.sum(axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the tallied scores with max-subtraction for stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse (guessing) distribution
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    p_final = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
    
    return p_final
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs = probs / probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] This design systematically pits Take The Best (TTB) against Weighted Additive (WADD) by creating 'compensatory' environments where the most valid discriminating cue points to option A, but a coalition of less valid cues points to option B. TTB relies solely on the highest-validity discriminating cue and will consistently choose A in these critical trials. In contrast, WADD integrates all features weighted by their validities, allowing the sheer number of lower-validity cues favoring B to outweigh the single high-validity cue favoring A. We also include non-compensatory trials where both models agree, ensuring that differences in model fit are driven by the specific cue-conflict structure rather than mere noise or random responding.

[1] This design systematically contrasts Weighted Additive (WADD) and Take The Best (TTB) by varying the distribution of less valid cues when the single most valid cue favors one option. In TTB, only the top discriminating cue dictates the choice, so the subject will consistently choose the option with the highest validity advantage. WADD, on the other hand, integrates all cues according to their validity weights. By creating 'compensatory' trials where the option lacking the highest-validity cue is supported by multiple lower-validity cues, we can produce stark opposite predictions between the two models. Non-compensatory trials are included as controls to ensure baseline adherence to cue validities.

[2] This design systematically pits Tallying with High Noise against Weighted Additive (WADD) by using 5 features with a steep drop-off in validities. In the critical trial (A: [1,1,0,0,0], B: [0,0,1,1,1]), Tallying predicts a preference for B because it has more positive features (3 vs 2), whereas WADD predicts a preference for A because the two high-validity features outweigh the three low-validity features. Furthermore, Tallying with High Noise predicts that across all trials, choices will be heavily regressed toward 0.50 (guessing) due to high decision conflict and noise, while WADD predicts strong, deterministic choices (probabilities near 1.0 or 0.0) whenever there is a clear difference in the weighted sums.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — heuristics that rely on validity-ordering re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) collapse WADD into a scaled Equal-Weight rule and make them indistinguishable by any decision.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended heuristics (TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) be dissociated; avoid trials where every heuristic agrees.


## Response

```json
{
  "rationale": "This design uses 6 features to create a quantitative dissociation between Weighted Additive (WADD) and Tallying with High Noise, avoiding the previously explored 5-feature steep drop-off design. By employing three high-validity cues and three low-validity cues, we can construct trials where Tallying predicts a tie (equal number of positive features) but WADD predicts a strong, deterministic preference for the option with high-validity features. Furthermore, we include critical dissociation trials where Tallying strictly prefers the option with more positive features (e.g., 4 vs 3), but WADD prefers the option with fewer, higher-validity features. Under the competing Tallying with High Noise theory, choices will be weakly distributed around 0.50 across all trials, whereas WADD predicts strong preferences that scale with the weighted sum differences.",
