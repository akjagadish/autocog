# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_6`).

Propose a new theory: 'Compressed Weighted Additive (WADD) Model'. Instead of a discrete fallback to a non-compensatory TTB rule, this theory should posit that subjects integrate all features using a compensatory WADD approach, but the subjective weights applied to the cues are heavily compressed toward equal weighting. This means the overall tally dominates the choice probability, but the cue validities exert a small, continuous influence across all trials. This avoids the over-prediction of TTB fallback while correctly capturing the subtle, pervasive validity effects missed by Pure Tallying.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.860)

**Description**
Tallying with Conditional Take-The-Best (TTB) Fallback: Decision makers primarily rely on a compensatory, equal-weight heuristic (Tallying). However, when the options are difficult to distinguish based on tallies alone (i.e., when the tallies are tied or very close), subjects fall back on a non-compensatory strategy, checking the single most valid discriminating cue (Take-The-Best). Importantly, this fallback is weak, meaning that even when tallies are tied, subjects often guess rather than deterministically applying TTB. This predicts localized, minor validity-driven asymmetries specifically when tallies fail to provide a strong signal, avoiding the overprediction of global validity effects characteristic of full WADD models.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.829)

**Description**
Mixture of Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB): Decision makers are heterogeneous in their strategy use. While the majority of choices are made using a compensatory equal-weight heuristic (Tallying), a smaller proportion of decisions rely on a non-compensatory, one-reason heuristic (Take-The-Best), which evaluates cues sequentially by validity and stops at the first discriminating cue. This mixture model captures both the dominant compensatory behavior and the minority non-compensatory behavior, providing a better fit to aggregate human data than either heuristic alone.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.778)

**Description**
Weighted Additive Strategy with Zero-Centered Tallying Interpolation. Decision-makers integrate all available cues using a compensatory strategy, but the subjective weights applied to the cues are a blend of uniform weighting (pure Tallying) and zero-centered objective validities. This allows behavior to smoothly transition from simply counting features (when cues are treated equally) to a fully validity-sensitive linear WADD model with high disparity between cues, capturing both the strong reliance on total feature counts in some contexts and the extreme validity-driven asymmetries in others.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1877 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1877 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Compressed Weighted Additive (WADD) Model: Decision makers integrate all available features using a compensatory strategy, but the subjective weights applied to the cues are heavily compressed toward equal weighting. This ensures that the simple tally of features dominates the choice probability in most cases, while the objective cue validities exert a small, continuous influence across all trials. This continuous mechanism naturally breaks tally ties and produces subtle validity effects without relying on a discrete fallback to a non-compensatory Take-The-Best rule.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Subjective weights compressed toward equal weighting (1.0)
    # The base weight of 1.0 ensures tallying dominates, while gamma scales the validity influence.
    weights = 1.0 + gamma * val
    
    score_a = np.sum(a * weights)
    score_b = np.sum(b * weights)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    z = beta * np.array([score_a, score_b])
    z -= np.max(z)
    p = np.exp(z)
    p /= np.sum(p)
    
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs)


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.0, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory implements a 'Compressed Weighted Additive (WADD) Model'. Instead of a discrete, conditional fallback to a non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic (as seen in pi_6), this model integrates all features compensatorily. By defining subjective weights as `1.0 + gamma * validities`, the model heavily compresses the weights toward equality. This guarantees that the overall tally of features dominates the choice probabilities, successfully capturing the primary decision driver. Simultaneously, the cue validities exert a continuous, subtle influence that scales with `gamma`, naturally breaking ties and avoiding the over-prediction of TTB fallback effects while capturing the pervasive validity-driven asymmetries missed by Pure Tallying.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate implements the prescribed Compressed Weighted Additive (WADD) Model. The loss improved and the candidate was accepted, successfully capturing tally-based dominance while introducing subtle validity effects. However, there is significant underprediction on Experiments 1 and 2 (metrics tracking alignment with the highest validity cue and TTB), and overprediction on Experiment 3. This suggests that while compressing weights towards 1.0 is the right structural approach, the current parameterization restricts the model from letting cue validities exert a strong enough influence when needed. Specifically, the `gamma` parameter range [0.0, 1.0] limits the maximum weight difference between cues, causing the model to behave too much like pure tallying.
Rationale: The candidate is structurally correct and was accepted, but the parameter bounds are too restrictive to fully capture the empirical validity effects (as seen in Exps 1, 2, and 3). Keep the exact same 'Compressed WADD' mechanism (`weights = 1.0 + gamma * val`), but expand the range of `gamma` from [0.0, 1.0] to [0.0, 5.0]. This will allow the optimizer to find a better balance between tally dominance and validity influence, enabling a stronger continuous effect of cue validities while remaining in the prescribed mechanism family.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1877 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
