# metric_exp00_attempt_01

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the pure Tallying (Equal-Weight) heuristic from the Mixture of Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB) model, we use a 5-feature design that systematically pits the total cue count against the highest-validity cue. Pure Tallying makes predictions based solely on the difference in the number of positive features between options, completely ignoring cue validities. The Mixture model, however, incorporates a TTB component, which will pull choice probabilities toward the option possessing the most valid discriminating cue. By including trials where Tallying strongly favors one option (e.g., 4 cues to 1) while TTB favors the other (due to the single highest-validity cue), as well as trials where Tallying predicts a tie (equal number of cues) but TTB predicts a clear winner, we can observe whether choice probabilities shift in the direction of the top cue. If human choices are driven purely by Tallying, the highest-validity cue will exert no disproportionate influence, and choice probabilities will depend entirely on the cue sum differences.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Tallying (Equal-Weight) Heuristic: People evaluate options by simply counting the number of positive features (or cues favoring each option) and choosing the option with the higher total count. This compensatory strategy ignores the differential validities or subjective importance of different cues, treating all pieces of evidence equally. The choice probability is determined by a softmax over the total feature tallies for each option, combined with a uniform lapse rate. Crucially, the softmax temperature is constrained to produce softer choice probabilities, reflecting that humans do not apply the tallying rule completely deterministically.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.0, 1.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

**`predict source code`:**

    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    # Tally the number of positive cues for each option
    score_a = np.sum(stim[0])
    score_b = np.sum(stim[1])
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Mixture of Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB): Decision makers are heterogeneous in their strategy use. While the majority of choices are made using a compensatory equal-weight heuristic (Tallying), a smaller proportion of decisions rely on a non-compensatory, one-reason heuristic (Take-The-Best), which evaluates cues sequentially by validity and stops at the first discriminating cue. This mixture model captures both the dominant compensatory behavior and the minority non-compensatory behavior, providing a better fit to aggregate human data than either heuristic alone.

**Parameters:**
- w_ttb: [0.0, 0.25]
- beta_tally: [0.0, 2.0]
- beta_ttb: [0.1, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
[0] rationale: This metric isolates trials where the Tallying (Equal-Weight) heuristic predicts a perfect tie (i.e., both options have an equal number of positive cues). Under the pure Tallying theory, choice probabilities on these trials are exactly 50/50, leading to a theoretical mean of 0.5 across subjects. Under the Mixture theory, the addition of the Take-The-Best (TTB) component breaks the tie in favor of the option with the highest-validity discriminating cue. By calculating the proportion of choices that align with the TTB winner on these specific 'Tally-tie' trials, we expect the Mixture model to produce a mean significantly greater than 0.5, while the Tallying model remains anchored at 0.5.

We split these trials into two sets: 'Aligned' trials where Take-The-Best (TTB) also favors the Tallying winner, and 'Opposed' trials where TTB favors the Tallying loser.
