# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Tallying (Equal-Weight) Heuristic: People evaluate options by simply counting the number of positive features (or cues favoring each option) and choosing the option with the higher total count. This compensatory strategy ignores the differential validities or subjective importance of different cues, treating all pieces of evidence equally. The choice probability is determined by a softmax over the total feature tallies for each option, combined with a uniform lapse rate. Crucially, the softmax temperature is constrained to produce softer choice probabilities, reflecting that humans do not apply the tallying rule completely deterministically.

**Rationale:** Following the latest feedback, the `beta` parameter range is further constrained from [0.0, 3.0] to [0.0, 1.0]. This minimal adjustment ensures the softmax over feature tallies produces even softer choice probabilities, correctly lowering the model's determinism to better match the observed ~59% human adherence to the tallying rule without changing the core mechanism.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    # Tally the number of positive cues for each option
    score_a = np.sum(stim[0])
    score_b = np.sum(stim[1])
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the tallies
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_5` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Weighted Additive Strategy with Zero-Centered Tallying Interpolation. Decision-makers integrate all available cues using a compensatory strategy, but the subjective weights applied to the cues are a blend of uniform weighting (pure Tallying) and zero-centered objective validities. This allows behavior to smoothly transition from simply counting features (when cues are treated equally) to a fully validity-sensitive linear WADD model with high disparity between cues, capturing both the strong reliance on total feature counts in some contexts and the extreme validity-driven asymmetries in others.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the previous model's use of raw validities limited the maximum weight ratio between cues to 2:1, which prevented the model from achieving the strong validity-sensitivity required to fit Experiments 1 and 2. To fix this, I changed the WADD component of the interpolation to use zero-centered validities (val - 0.5). This allows for much larger weight disparities when alpha is high, enabling the model to capture the heuristic-like choices in Exps 1 and 2. At the same time, when alpha is low, the weights still smoothly collapse to uniform 1.0s, preserving the Tallying-like behavior that successfully captured Experiment 3.

**Parameters:**
  - `alpha`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    alpha = float(parameters["alpha"])
    
    # Blend between uniform weights (Tallying) and zero-centered validities (WADD)
    weights = (1.0 - alpha) * 1.0 + alpha * (val - 0.5)
    
    # Compensatory integration: sum of weighted cues
    scores = np.sum(stim * weights, axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the integrated scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse rate for choice noise
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Tallying with Conditional Take-The-Best (TTB) Fallback: Decision makers primarily rely on a compensatory, equal-weight heuristic (Tallying). However, when the options are difficult to distinguish based on tallies alone (i.e., when the tallies are tied or very close), subjects fall back on a non-compensatory strategy, checking the single most valid discriminating cue (Take-The-Best). Importantly, this fallback is weak, meaning that even when tallies are tied, subjects often guess rather than deterministically applying TTB. This predicts localized, minor validity-driven asymmetries specifically when tallies fail to provide a strong signal, avoiding the overprediction of global validity effects characteristic of full WADD models.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, we increased the upper bound of `w_far` from 0.2 to 0.5. This allows the model to capture the baseline level of TTB usage when tallies are not tied, correcting the underprediction of validity usage on non-tie trials (Experiments 1 and 2) and the overprediction of tallying on Experiment 3. At the same time, it preserves the reduced `w_close` bound that successfully prevents overprediction on tie trials.

**Parameters:**
  - `threshold`: `{0, 1}`
  - `w_close`: `[0.0, 0.3]`
  - `w_far`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `beta_tally`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `beta_ttb`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
