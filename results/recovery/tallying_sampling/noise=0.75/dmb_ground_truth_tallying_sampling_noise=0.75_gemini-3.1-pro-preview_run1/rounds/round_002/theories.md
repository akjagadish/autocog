# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Probabilistic Take-The-Best (TTB with evaluation error): Subjects evaluate features sequentially in order of validity, making a decision based on the first feature that discriminates between the options. However, feature evaluation is subject to noise. When a feature actually discriminates, there is a probability 'gamma' (evaluation error) that the subject fails to notice or utilize this discrimination, causing them to mistakenly proceed to the next feature in the hierarchy. If all features are exhausted without a decision, the subject guesses. A baseline lapse rate 'epsilon' accounts for completely random choices independent of the cue evaluation process.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we widen the epsilon parameter range to [0.0, 1.0] to allow the model more flexibility in capturing high levels of noise or guessing, which may help it fit the lower TTB adherence and higher-sum choices observed in the experiments without changing the core probabilistic TTB mechanism.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    val = np.asarray(parameters['validities'], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters['gamma'])
    epsilon = float(parameters['epsilon'])
    
    # Sort cues by descending validity; stable sort to preserve original order on ties
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind='stable')
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    p_a = 0.0
    p_b = 0.0
    p_reach = 1.0
    
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            p_a += p_reach * (1.0 - gamma)
            p_reach *= gamma
        elif b[j] > a[j]:
            p_b += p_reach * (1.0 - gamma)
            p_reach *= gamma
            
    # If no feature discriminates (or all discriminating features were missed), guess uniformly
    p_a += p_reach * 0.5
    p_b += p_reach * 0.5
    
    p_core = np.array([p_a, p_b])
    
    # Blend with standard uniform lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * 0.5
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Dual-Process Strategy Mixture: Decision-making is driven by a probabilistic mixture of two distinct strategies. With a certain probability (mixture_p), subjects employ a non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic, making a choice based solely on the most valid discriminating cue. Otherwise, they use a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy, integrating all available features weighted by their validities into a comprehensive utility score. This blend captures both the strict, flat sensitivity of heuristic processing and the graded, trade-off sensitivity of compensatory processing.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the parameter range for `beta` has been slightly widened to [0.1, 3.5]. This intermediate range aims to strike a better balance by restoring some of the compensatory determinism lost in the previous iteration, which should help recover performance in Experiments 2 and 6 while maintaining the gains achieved in Experiments 3 and 4.

**Parameters:**
  - `mixture_p`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 3.5]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`

            p_ttb = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
