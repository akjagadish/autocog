# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Tallying (Equal Weighting) posits that decision-makers simply count the total number of positive features for each option, ignoring the differential validities of the cues. The option with the higher count of positive features is preferred. This represents a compensatory but highly frugal heuristic, where evidence is accumulated equally across all available cues. If the counts are equal, the decision-maker guesses. Response noise is modeled via a softmax over these counts with an independent lapse rate. To account for empirical choices that often deviate from pure tallying on conflict trials, the decision process incorporates substantial choice noise.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we implement a minimal diff to the Tallying model by further restricting the `beta` parameter to `[0.0, 2.0]`. The previous iteration successfully brought the loss down by allowing more choice noise, but the model still slightly underpredicted the empirical rate of TTB-consistent choices on conflict trials. By lowering the upper bound of beta even further, we force the model to be less deterministic on these trials, pushing the predictions closer to the empirical ~0.42-0.45 range.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 2.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features)")
        
    # Tallying: count the number of positive features for each option
    scores = np.sum(stim, axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Probabilistic Search Take-The-Best (PS-TTB)

**Rationale:** Follows the critic's advice to implement a non-compensatory Take-The-Best model with a probabilistic cue search order. The model stops at the first discriminating cue, maintaining a strict non-compensatory mechanism at the single-trial level. However, the order in which cues are searched is sampled without replacement using a softmax over cue validities (via the Gumbel-max trick). The temperature parameter `tau` controls the determinism of the search order. When `tau` is large, the search order becomes uniform, which on average mimics the compensatory tallying-like behavior observed in Experiment 4, bridging the gap between non-compensatory heuristics and compensatory empirical patterns.

**Parameters:**
  - `tau`: `[0.01, 100.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    diff = stim[0] - stim[1]
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters['validities'], dtype=float)
    tau = float(parameters['tau'])
    epsilon = float(parameters['epsilon'])
    
    n_features = len(validities)
    n_samples = 1000
    
    # Gumbel-max trick to sample permutations without replacement
    # probabilities proportional to softmax(validities / tau)
    logits = validities / (tau + 1e-6)
    gumbels = np.random.gumbel(size=(n_samples, n_features))
    orders = np.argsort(-(logits + gumbels), axis=1)
    
    diff_sign = np.sign(diff)
    ordered_diffs = diff_sign[orders]
    
    # Find the first discriminating cue in each sampled search order
    abs_diffs = np.abs(ordered_diffs)
    first_non_zero_idx = np.argmax(abs_diffs, axis=1)
    has_non_zero = np.any(abs_diffs > 0, axis=1)
    
    first_non_zero_vals = ordered_diffs[np.arange(n_samples), first_non_zero_idx]
    
    wins_a = np.sum((first_non_zero_vals == 1) & has_non_zero)
    wins_b = np.sum((first_non_zero_vals == -1) & has_non_zero)
    
    total = wins_a + wins_b
    if total > 0:
        p = np.array([wins_a / total, wins_b / total])
    else:
        p = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p + epsilon * (np.ones(2) / 2.0)
```

    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```
