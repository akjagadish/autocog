## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended heuristics (e.g. TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every heuristic agrees, and prefer pairs that dissociate single-feature focus from feature-summing strategies. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities
- weights: [(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Strategy Mixture Model: Decision-making in multi-attribute choice is heterogeneous. Individuals (or single decisions) rely on a probabilistic mixture of non-compensatory heuristics (like Take The Best) and compensatory integration (like Weighted Additive). Because TTB and WADD produce scores on fundamentally different scales, their choice determinism is parameterized independently. This allows the mixture to flexibly capture the intermediate match rates observed in empirical data without being constrained by an artificial coupling of noise levels across strategies.

**Parameters:**
- beta_ttb: [0.1, 20.0]
- beta_wadd: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- w_ttb: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] To cleanly dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from Weighted Additive (WADD), we employ a design where a single highly valid cue favors one option, but multiple lower-validity cues favor the other. TTB, being a non-compensatory 'one-reason' heuristic, will consistently choose the option with the highest valid discriminating cue, ignoring all other features. In contrast, WADD integrates all features, allowing a deficit on the most valid cue to be compensated by an accumulation of smaller advantages on lower-validity cues. The trial pairs are constructed to pit the highest-validity discriminating cue against various combinations of lower-validity cues, ensuring the two models predict opposite choices across multiple contexts.

[1] Instead of simply pitting the single best cue against all others (which was previously explored), this design systematically introduces ties on the highest-validity cues to trigger the 'cue cascade'. TTB evaluates options sequentially and stops at the first discriminating cue, ignoring all remaining cues regardless of how many favor the alternative. By tying the top cues in various combinations, we force TTB to rely on the 2nd or 3rd cue, while WADD continues to integrate all features. This allows us to test if the non-compensatory threshold is absolute or if subjects are more likely to compensate when the discriminating cue is further down the validity hierarchy. WADD predicts a compensatory choice favoring the option with more lower-validity cues, while TTB predicts strict adherence to the first discriminating cue, even if it is only the 3rd most valid overall.

[2] To quantitatively dissociate the Strategy Mixture Model from a pure Weighted Additive (WADD) model, we exploit the fact that a pure WADD model predicts choice probabilities that are strictly a monotonic function of the difference in weighted sums (a single sigmoid curve). The Strategy Mixture Model, however, predicts that choices are a mixture of WADD and Take The Best (TTB). Therefore, if we plot the probability of choosing Option A against the WADD difference (WADD_A - WADD_B), the Mixture Model predicts that the points will split into distinct curves depending on which option TTB favors. We construct pairs that systematically vary the WADD difference while orthogonally manipulating the TTB prediction (e.g., pairs where WADD strongly favors B but TTB favors A, and vice versa). A pure WADD model cannot account for vertical shifts in choice probability at the same WADD difference caused by the non-compensatory TTB component.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — heuristics that rely on validity-ordering re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) collapse WADD into a scaled Equal-Weight rule and make them indistinguishable by any decision.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended heuristics (TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) be dissociated; avoid trials where every heuristic agrees.


## Response

{
  "rationale": "By fixing validities such that multiple pairs produce an exact tie in the objective Weighted Additive (WADD) score, we can sharply dissociate the Advocated WADD model (which features free weighting parameters per cue) from the Strategy Mixture Model (which restricts its WADD component to use exact objective validities). For these objective-WADD-tied pairs, the Strategy Mixture Model is strictly forced to predict a preference aligned with the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic, because the WADD component provides no directional preference. In contrast, the Advocated WADD model can accommodate choices that go against TTB on these 'tied' trials by allowing subjective weights to deviate from objective validities. We include a spectrum of objective WADD ties, small differences, and opposing TTB predictions to fully expose this parameterization difference.",
