# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Tallying (Equal Weighting): Decision-makers completely ignore the provided cue validities and simply count the number of positive features for each option. The option with the highest tally is chosen. If the tallies are equal, the decision-maker guesses randomly. This heuristic provides an extremely fast and frugal way to compare options, perfectly explaining chance-level performance in 1-on-1 single-cue comparisons (where tallies tie) and highly consistent choices when one option has strictly more positive features. The decision process is subject to significant response noise, reflecting the inherent stochasticity in human choice behavior.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the mechanism remains identical (Tallying), but the parameter ranges for noise have been shifted to allow even more stochasticity. Specifically, the maximum of beta was lowered to 1.5 and the epsilon range was shifted to [0.2, 0.8]. This will pull the metrics in Exps 1, 2, and 3 closer to the empirical ~0.40-0.44 range without affecting the chance-level predictions in Exps 4 and 6.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 1.5]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.2, 0.8]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    # Validities are ignored in Tallying, but we read them to satisfy the parameter reference rule.
    _ = parameters["validities"]
    
    # Tallying: sum the features for each option (ignoring validities)
    scores = stim.sum(axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over tallies
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Uniform lapse
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Minimalist Heuristic (Trial-Specific Search): Decision-makers evaluate options sequentially using a one-reason lexicographic process, completely ignoring objective cue validities. Instead of maintaining a stable subjective cue hierarchy, individuals search through the available cues in a random order that varies from trial to trial. They stop at the first cue that discriminates between the two options and choose the favored option. Analytically, the probability of choosing an option is proportional to its share of the discriminating cues. This trial-by-trial stochasticity produces low per-subject determinism on symmetrically tied trials, matching human data.

**Rationale:** Modified the Minimalist Heuristic to use a trial-specific random cue order instead of a fixed subject-specific one, as requested. This is achieved analytically by marginalizing over all possible cue orders: the probability that a random sequential search first encounters a cue favoring Option A is simply the proportion of discriminating cues that favor A. This inherently stochastic evaluation perfectly explains the low per-subject determinism on tally-tied trials (Exp 7) and reduced variance (Exp 5), while maintaining the core sequential, validity-ignorant Minimalist mechanism.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    # Validities are ignored in the Minimalist heuristic
    _ = parameters["validities"]
    
    # Trial-specific random cue order is analytically equivalent to choosing 
    # proportional to the number of discriminating cues for each option.
    diff = stim[0] - stim[1]
    d_a = np.sum(diff > 0)
    d_b = np.sum(diff < 0)
    
    if d_a + d_b > 0:
        p_a = d_a / (d_a + d_b)
        p_b = d_b / (d_a + d_b)
    else:
