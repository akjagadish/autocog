# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Decision-makers use a 'Tallying' (Equal-Weight) heuristic, a compensatory strategy that ignores cue validities. They simply count the number of positive features (or advantages) each option has and choose the option with the highest total count. If the counts are equal, they guess. Because pure Tallying makes choices that strongly oppose Take The Best on compensatory trials, high levels of choice stochasticity (noise) are needed to pull the predicted consistency up toward the observed ~0.40-0.42 range, reflecting uncertainty or lapses in applying the heuristic.

**Rationale:** As advised by the critic, the Tallying mechanism underpredicts TTB consistency on these compensatory trials because it deterministically favors the non-TTB option. To pull the predictions closer to the observed ~0.40-0.42 range (closer to 0.5), we further restrict the parameters to enforce higher stochasticity. We lowered the upper bound of beta to 1.0 and shifted the epsilon range to [0.3, 0.8] to allow for even more uniform lapsing, bridging the remaining gap toward the observed data.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.01, 1.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.3, 0.8]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    
    # Tallying: sum the unweighted feature values for each option.
    scores = stim.sum(axis=1)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Take-The-Best (TTB) Heuristic

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's instructions, we replace the WADD theory with the Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. TTB is a lexicographic, non-compensatory strategy that evaluates cues sequentially in descending order of validity. It stops at the first cue that discriminates between the two options and chooses the option favored by that cue, ignoring all remaining cues. By introducing TTB, we provide a classic fast-and-frugal benchmark to definitively contrast against compensatory rules like Tallying. A wide epsilon range allows the model to capture high error rates if the data strongly deviate from TTB choices.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Order cues by descending validity
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        elif b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break
            
    if winner is None:
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])
        beta = float(parameters["beta"])
        z = beta * scores
        z = z - np.max(z)
        e = np.exp(z)
        p_core = e / np.sum(e)
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) Decision Theory with Flexible Sigmoid Subjective Validity Transformation

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, a free parameter `delta` is introduced to represent the inflection point of the sigmoid curve used for subjective validity transformation. This allows the model to flexibly shift the psychophysical mapping of validities to weights, potentially restoring the fit on Experiments 1, 2, 5, and 6 while maintaining the improvements achieved on Experiments 3 and 4. The model remains strictly within the WADD framework.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.01, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 5.0]`
  - `delta`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    delta = float(parameters["delta"])
    
    # Transform raw probabilities into subjective weights using a sigmoid function
    w = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-gamma * (validities - delta)))
    
    # Calculate the overall score for each option by multiplying cue values by subjective weights
    scores = stim @ w
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice based on the weighted scores
    z = beta * scores
    z = z - np.max(z)  # for numerical stability
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Incorporate lapse rate for uniform guessing
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```
