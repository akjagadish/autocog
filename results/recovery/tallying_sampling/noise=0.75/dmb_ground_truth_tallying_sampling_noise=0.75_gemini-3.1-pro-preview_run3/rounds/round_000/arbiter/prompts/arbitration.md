# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 10: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To robustly dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from the Weighted Additive Rule (WADD), we must exploit their fundamental difference: TTB is non-compensatory (a single high-validity cue dictates the choice), whereas WADD is compensatory (multiple lower-validity cues can outweigh a single high-validity cue). We use 5 features with linearly decreasing validities. The design includes 'compensatory' trials where the option favored by the single best discriminating cue is opposed by all (or most) remaining lower-validity cues. In these trials, TTB strictly chooses the option with the best cue, while WADD chooses the option supported by the sum of the lower cues. We also include 'non-compensatory' (agreement) trials as a baseline to ensure subjects are paying attention and to constrain noise parameters.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that are consistent with the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic. For each trial, it identifies the first discriminating cue (in order of descending validity) and checks if the subject chose the option favored by that cue. Because the experimental design intentionally pits TTB against WADD on 80% of the trials (where the highest-validity discriminating cue favors one option but the sum of all lower-validity cues favors the other), data simulated under TTB will yield a score close to 1.0 (subject to noise), while data simulated under WADD will yield a score well below 0.5. This provides a massive, reliable separation between the two theories.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To robustly dissociate the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule from Take The Best (TTB), we use four features with descending validities. We design 'compensatory' trials where the option favored by the single highest discriminating cue (which TTB strictly follows) is opposed by the sum of all remaining lower-validity cues (which WADD favors). By varying which cue is the highest discriminating one (e.g., the first vs. the second cue), we ensure that TTB's non-compensatory stopping rule is tested at multiple levels of the cue hierarchy. We also include agreement trials to establish baseline performance and constrain noise parameters.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates 'compensatory' trials where the Take The Best (TTB) model and the Weighted Additive (WADD) model make opposing predictions. TTB strictly follows the single highest discriminating cue, whereas WADD integrates all cues, allowing lower-validity cues to compensate. By calculating the proportion of choices that align with TTB specifically on these conflicting trials, we can cleanly separate the two theories. TTB will produce a score near 1.0, while WADD will produce a score considerably lower (often near 0.0, depending on the exact subjective feature weights).

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across both experiments, Theory 2 (Weighted Additive - WADD) significantly outperforms Theory 1 (Take The Best - TTB). The experimental designs explicitly pitted the non-compensatory TTB against the compensatory WADD by creating trials where the single best cue favored one option, but the sum of all lower-validity cues favored the other. In both experiments, the observed consistency with TTB was around 0.40-0.42, which is much closer to WADD's predictions (0.27-0.34) than TTB's predictions (~0.85). This demonstrates that subjects are integrating multiple cues rather than stopping at the first discriminating cue. However, WADD slightly underpredicts the TTB consistency, suggesting that subjects might be using a simpler compensatory strategy than fully weighting by validities. Theory 1 (TTB) is fundamentally misaligned with the compensatory nature of the data and should be replaced.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace Theory 1 (Take The Best) with a 'Tallying' (Equal-Weight) theory. Unlike TTB, Tallying is a compensatory heuristic; unlike WADD, it ignores cue validities. Under Tallying, decision-makers simply count the number of positive features (or advantages) each option has and choose the option with the highest total count. If the counts are equal, they guess. This provides a strong alternative benchmark that is compensatory but less cognitively demanding than WADD, potentially bridging the gap between WADD's predictions and the observed data."
