# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_6`).

Propose a new theory that blends the strengths of both: a 'Mixture of Tallying and Noisy Objective WADD'. Instead of Take-The-Best, the compensatory component should be a Weighted Additive rule that uses the actual objective validities, but is subject to significant decision noise or validity-compression (e.g., a power parameter on validities). This allows the model to reflect the objective validities (helping on Exps 7-9) while preventing it from making overly deterministic tie-breaking choices on Exps 1-2, as the noise or compression will soften the WADD predictions closer to 50% when feature sums are tied.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Mixture of Tallying and Noisy Objective WADD with independent temperatures: Decision-makers probabilistically mix between a simple equal-weight heuristic (Tallying) and a Weighted Additive (WADD) rule. The WADD component uses objective validities transformed by a power parameter (gamma) to compress or expand differences. Because the scales of evidence for Tallying (integer counts) and WADD (power-transformed validities) differ drastically, they employ independent decision noise temperatures to properly calibrate choice determinism before mixing.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w_tally = float(parameters["w_tally"])
    beta_tally = float(parameters["beta_tally"])

    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # --- Objective WADD with Validity Compression --- 
    # A power parameter 'gamma' scales the objective validities.
    # gamma < 1 compresses differences (closer to equal weights),
    # gamma > 1 expands differences (closer to lexicographic/TTB).
    v_adj = val ** gamma
    scores_wadd = stim @ v_adj
    z_wadd = beta_wadd * (scores_wadd - scores_wadd.max())
    e_wadd = np.exp(z_wadd)

    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- beta_tally: [0.01, 10.0]
- beta_wadd: [0.01, 10.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- w_tally: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, we introduce separate inverse temperatures (`beta_tally` and `beta_wadd`) for the Tallying and WADD components. Because the scale of WADD scores changes drastically with the `gamma` parameter, a single shared `beta` could not properly calibrate the determinism of the softmax for both strategies simultaneously. Independent temperatures allow the model to better match human choice probabilities across experiments where different heuristics dominate.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1271 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1404 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1271.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the arbiter's prescribed Mixture of Tallying and Noisy Objective WADD and achieves a solid baseline fit. However, it struggles to quantitatively match human behavior on Experiments 3, 4, 5, and 7. A primary driver of this mismatch is the shared inverse temperature (`beta`) for both the Tallying and WADD components. Because `v_adj = val ** gamma`, the scale of `scores_wadd` can vary drastically depending on `gamma` (e.g., shrinking towards 0 for large gamma if validities < 1). This forces a single `beta` to improperly compromise between calibrating the determinism of Tallying (which operates on integer sums up to 5) and WADD, leading to poorly calibrated mixture probabilities.
Rationale: Keep the prescribed mechanism family (Mixture of Tallying and Noisy Objective WADD), but address the scaling issue between the two components. Because the scale of `scores_wadd` changes drastically with `gamma`, a single shared `beta` cannot properly tune the softmax determinism for both strategies simultaneously. Please modify the model by either: 1) introducing separate inverse temperatures (`beta_tally` and `beta_wadd`), or 2) normalizing the adjusted validities (e.g., `v_adj = v_adj / v_adj.max()`) so that the WADD scores remain on a stable scale comparable to Tallying. This minor adjustment will allow the model to calibrate the decision noise of both components properly.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1271 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1404 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate theory attempted to resolve the scale discrepancy between Tallying and WADD by introducing independent inverse temperatures (`beta_tally` and `beta_wadd`). However, this candidate was rejected by the accept gate, as the aggregate loss worsened (0.1404 compared to the iter 1 base of 0.1271). The additional degrees of freedom likely overparameterized the decision noise, making the mixture unstable across experiments and exacerbating mismatches on key conflict experiments (e.g., Exp 3 and Exp 5). We need a different approach to harmonize the scales of the two components while maintaining a single, stable temperature parameter.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since the independent temperatures approach was rejected, the loop will revert to the iter 1 base (which uses a single shared `beta`). To address the scale discrepancy without adding new parameters, you should normalize the scores internally. Specifically, normalize the power-transformed validities so they sum to 1: `v_adj = (val ** gamma) / np.sum(val ** gamma)`. This bounds the WADD scores between 0 and 1. To make Tallying comparable, divide the tallying sum by the total number of features (so it is also bounded between 0 and 1). This ensures that both components operate on the exact same scale, allowing a single shared `beta` to cleanly and consistently calibrate the softmax determinism across all experiments."
