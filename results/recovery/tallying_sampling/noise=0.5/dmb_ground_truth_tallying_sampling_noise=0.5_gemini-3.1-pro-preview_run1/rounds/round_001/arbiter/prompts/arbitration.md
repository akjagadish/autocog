# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Tallying (Equal Weights) assumes that decision-makers rely on a simple compensatory heuristic where they count the total number of positive features for each option, completely ignoring cue validities. The option with the higher count of positive features is chosen. This equal-weighting strategy is less cognitively demanding than the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule while still allowing for compensatory decision-making, where multiple weaker cues can override a single strong cue.

    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [1.0, 0.9, 0.6, 0.5, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Tallying (Equal Weights) from WADD (Weighted Additive), we use a 5-feature environment with a steep drop-off in validities. We design 'opposition' trials where one option has fewer positive features but those features are of very high validity, while the other option has more positive features of lower validity. Tallying will strictly prefer the option with more positive features, whereas WADD will prefer the option with the higher weighted sum. We also include 'indifference' trials where Tallying predicts a tie but WADD has a strong preference, and 'agreement' trials where both models prefer the same option, to establish baseline performance and noise levels.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times subjects choose the option with more positive features but lower overall validity (ratings [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] vs [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]). Tallying (Equal Weights) will strongly prefer the 3-feature option, resulting in a metric close to 1.0. WADD (Weighted Additive) will prioritize the high-validity features of the 2-feature option, resulting in a metric significantly lower than 0.5.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate WADD from Tallying, we use a 5-feature environment with a set of validities that allows for strong divergence between weighted sums and simple feature counts. We include 'opposition' trials where one option possesses fewer total positive features but those features have much higher validities (Tallying prefers the option with more features; WADD prefers the option with higher validities). We also include 'indifference' trials where both options have the same number of positive features but different weighted sums (Tallying predicts a tie; WADD predicts a strict preference). Finally, agreement trials are included to assess baseline performance and estimate noise parameters.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times a subject chooses the option with fewer but more valid features (1, 1, 0, 0, 0) over the option with more but less valid features (0, 0, 1, 1, 1). According to the Weighted Additive (WADD) theory, subjects will prefer the first option because its weighted sum (1.80) is higher than the second's (1.65). Conversely, according to the Tallying (Equal Weights) theory, subjects will strongly prefer the second option because it has more positive features (3 vs 2). This creates a stark contrast: WADD yields a choice proportion > 0.5, whereas Tallying yields a choice proportion < 0.5, reliably discriminating the two theories.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across Experiments 1 and 2, subjects consistently prefer the option with the higher total number of positive features, even when those features have lower validity. Tallying (pi_3) successfully predicts this qualitative effect (predicting >0.5 in Exp 1 and <0.5 in Exp 2), whereas WADD (pi_2) makes the exact opposite predictions, expecting subjects to maximize expected validity. In Experiments 3 and 4, the low match rates for Take-The-Best (TTB) on compensatory trials confirm that subjects are largely relying on compensatory counting strategies (Tallying) rather than strictly lexicographic ones (TTB) or pure WADD. WADD is fundamentally misspecified for this dataset since subjects do not appear to weight features by their stated validities in a linear additive fashion.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "The WADD theory (pi_2) is degenerate as it qualitatively fails to capture the subjects' reliance on feature counting over validity maximization. Propose a brand-new theory, such as a 'Mixture of Heuristics' (where individuals probabilistically switch between Tallying and Take-The-Best) or a 'Rank-Weighted Additive' model (where validities are highly compressed into ordinal ranks, drastically reducing the compensatory power of high-validity cues). This would provide a stronger, more realistic competitor to pure Tallying."
