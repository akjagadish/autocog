# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

The WADD theory (pi_2) is degenerate as it qualitatively fails to capture the subjects' reliance on feature counting over validity maximization. Propose a brand-new theory, such as a 'Mixture of Heuristics' (where individuals probabilistically switch between Tallying and Take-The-Best) or a 'Rank-Weighted Additive' model (where validities are highly compressed into ordinal ranks, drastically reducing the compensatory power of high-validity cues). This would provide a stronger, more realistic competitor to pure Tallying.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Mixture of Heuristics: Subjects probabilistically switch between a compensatory, equal-weighting strategy (Tallying) and a frugal, lexicographic strategy (Take-The-Best). By mixing these two heuristics with a prior bias towards Tallying, the model captures the dominant tendency to count features while allowing for occasional validity-maximizing behavior, avoiding the unrealistic assumption of full compensatory validity weighting (WADD).

- beta_ttb: [0.01, 20.0]
- p_tally: [0.4, 0.85]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.1]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, I expanded and shifted the `p_tally` parameter bounds downwards from [0.5, 1.0] to [0.4, 0.85]. The previous bounds forced the model to be slightly too Tally-dominant, under-predicting the empirical ~35% TTB match rate. This adjustment allows the model to find a slightly more balanced mixture, increasing the proportion of TTB-consistent choices while maintaining the overall preference for Tallying. The core mechanism and other parameters remain unchanged.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2629 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1444 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0735 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0735.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The proposed Mixture of Heuristics (Tallying and Take-The-Best) successfully improves upon the pure WADD model and was accepted by the gate. However, the candidate's predictions currently hover around 0.5 across all experiments, failing to capture the magnitude of the observed effects. The human data shows a strong, systematic preference for Tallying over TTB/WADD (e.g., only ~32-35% TTB/WADD matches in Experiments 1, 2, and 4). The model is likely over-mixing TTB or suffering from too much lapse noise.
Rationale: The Mixture of Heuristics is the right mechanism family, but the parameter ranges are preventing it from capturing the strong human bias towards Tallying. Constrain the `p_tally` parameter range to favor Tallying (e.g., [0.5, 1.0]) rather than allowing it to span the entire [0.0, 1.0] interval. Additionally, reduce the `epsilon` (lapse rate) range to [0.0, 0.1] to prevent the model from defaulting to random guessing. Keep the core logic intact.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2629 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1444 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The revised Mixture of Heuristics model with constrained parameters successfully captures the qualitative direction of the human data, reducing the aggregate loss substantially. However, by restricting `p_tally` to [0.5, 1.0], the model now slightly over-predicts the reliance on Tallying and under-predicts the proportion of Take-The-Best (TTB) consistent choices. Across Experiments 1, 2, and 4, the candidate predicts TTB/WADD matches around 0.24-0.27, whereas the true human rates are higher, around 0.32-0.35. This suggests the prior constraint was slightly too aggressive in suppressing the TTB strategy.
Rationale: The mechanism family is working well, but the `p_tally` parameter bounds are forcing the model to be slightly too Tally-dominant. To hit the empirical ~35% TTB match rate, adjust the `p_tally` bounds slightly downwards (e.g., from [0.5, 1.0] to [0.4, 0.85]). This will allow the model to find a slightly more balanced mixture while still maintaining the overall preference for Tallying. Keep `epsilon` and the core mechanism unchanged.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1444 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0735 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Mixture of Heuristics model with the refined `p_tally` bounds of [0.4, 0.85] yields an excellent fit across all experiments. The aggregate loss has dropped to 0.0735, which is highly competitive. The model accurately reproduces the human tendency to rely primarily on Tallying while occasionally utilizing Take-The-Best. In Experiments 1, 2, and 4, the candidate predicts TTB/WADD match rates of ~0.36-0.41, which are very close to the empirical values of ~0.32-0.35. Experiment 3 is also remarkably well captured (0.6100 vs 0.6333). The minor adjustments to the mixture weight bounds successfully balanced the competing heuristic strategies.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The current model formulation and parameter ranges successfully capture the empirical phenomena across all four experiments with high precision. The mixture between Tallying and Take-The-Best is well-calibrated, and the aggregate loss is extremely low. No further adjustments are necessary; the theory should be retained as the new baseline."
