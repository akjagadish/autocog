# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3_1" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3_1
Tallying (Equal Weights) assumes that decision-makers rely on a simple compensatory heuristic where they count the total number of positive features for each option, completely ignoring cue validities. The option with the higher count of positive features is chosen. This equal-weighting strategy is less cognitively demanding than the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule while still allowing for compensatory decision-making, where multiple weaker cues can override a single strong cue.

## THEORY 2 — pi_4
Mixture of Heuristics: Subjects probabilistically switch between a compensatory, equal-weighting strategy (Tallying) and a frugal, lexicographic strategy (Take-The-Best). By mixing these two heuristics with a prior bias towards Tallying, the model captures the dominant tendency to count features while allowing for occasional validity-maximizing behavior, avoiding the unrealistic assumption of full compensatory validity weighting (WADD).

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate pure Tallying from a Mixture of Heuristics (Tallying + Take-The-Best), we create specific 'indifference' and 'opposition' trials. On indifference trials, both options have the same number of positive features, but one option possesses the highest-validity feature. Pure Tallying predicts a strict 50/50 choice, whereas the Mixture model predicts a bias towards the option with the highest-validity feature. On opposition trials, one option has more positive features but lacks the highest-validity feature; pure Tallying predicts a strong preference for the feature-rich option, while the Mixture model predicts a weakened preference due to the conflicting TTB component. Agreement trials are included to assess baseline performance and noise.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates 'indifference' trials where both options have the exact same number of positive features (equal tally). On these trials, the pure Tallying model predicts a strict 50/50 choice because the total sum of features is tied. The Mixture of Heuristics model, however, will lean towards the option favored by the Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic (i.e., the option with the highest-validity discriminating cue). By calculating the proportion of choices that align with the TTB prediction on equal-tally trials, we expect a value around 0.5 for Tallying and a value significantly greater than 0.5 for the Mixture model.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_4)

### DESIGN

**Trial pairs (n=8):**

  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Mixture of Heuristics (Tallying + Take-The-Best) from pure Tallying, we use a 5-feature environment with a distinct validity hierarchy. We design 'indifference' trials where both options have the same number of positive features, but Option A possesses the highest-validity feature (or the highest discriminating feature). Pure Tallying predicts a 50/50 choice on these trials, whereas the Mixture model predicts a systematic preference for Option A due to the TTB component. We also design 'opposition' trials where Option B has more positive features (favored by Tallying) but Option A has the highest-validity feature (favored by TTB). Pure Tallying will strongly prefer Option B, while the Mixture model will show a dampened preference or even a reversal. Agreement trials are included to establish baseline performance.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
By isolating trials where the total number of positive features is equal between Option A and Option B, we perfectly control for the Tallying heuristic, which predicts exactly a 50/50 choice probability (indifference). However, the experimental design ensures that on these specific trials, Option A possesses the highest-validity discriminating cue. Therefore, the Take-The-Best heuristic strongly predicts choosing Option A. The pure Tallying model will yield a metric value around 0.5, whereas the Mixture of Heuristics model (which incorporates Take-The-Best) will significantly deviate above 0.5.

        return 0.5

    # Option A is favored by the Take-The-Best heuristic on all these trials.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all experiments, Theory 1 (Tallying) consistently and accurately predicts the observed data, whereas Theory 2 (Mixture of Heuristics) fails. Specifically, on 'indifference' trials where both options have the same number of positive features but differ in cue validities (Experiments 1, 2, 7, and 8), the observed choice proportions are almost exactly 0.50. Theory 1 correctly predicts this 50/50 split because it ignores validities. Theory 2 predicts a significant deviation from 0.50 due to its Take-The-Best component, which is strongly disconfirmed by the data. The robust finding is that subjects completely ignore cue validities in this paradigm.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "The Mixture of Heuristics model is fundamentally flawed because the data strongly refutes any use of validity-based heuristics like Take-The-Best; subjects consistently guess 50/50 when feature counts are tied. Replace Theory 2 with a brand-new theory that also ignores cue validities but posits a different underlying cognitive mechanism than simple Tallying. For example, propose a 'Cancellation and Focus' or 'Similarity Heuristic' where subjects first eliminate features shared by both options and only tally the remaining unique features. This would provide a psychologically distinct alternative to Theory 1 while maintaining the necessary property of validity-independence."
