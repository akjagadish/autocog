# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Propose a 'Heuristic Toolbox' or 'Take-The-Best (TTB) Mixture' theory. The current theories fail to account for trials where subjects might rely on a single discriminating cue (lexicographic strategy) rather than compensatory integration or simple counting. The new theory should posit that individuals probability-mix between Take-The-Best (which sequentially searches validities and stops at the first discriminating cue), Tallying, and WADD. This 3-way mixture or a TTB+Tallying mixture can better capture the empirical data where choices sometimes strongly deviate from compensatory WADD predictions even when Tallying is tied.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Heuristic Toolbox (3-Way Mixture): Decision-makers are equipped with a repertoire of strategies and probabilistically switch between them. Specifically, individuals mix between a non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic, an equal-weight Tallying heuristic, and a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. TTB sequentially searches cues in order of validity and decides based on the first discriminating cue. Tallying counts positive features, and WADD integrates features with subjective validity weights. This mixture captures instances where subjects rely on a single dominant cue, as well as instances where they integrate multiple cues equally or proportionally to their importance.

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- w_ttb: [0.0, 1.0]
- w_tally_rel: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities
- weights: [(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's feedback, this model implements a 'Heuristic Toolbox' comprising Take-The-Best (TTB), Tallying, and WADD. By introducing TTB into the mixture, the model accounts for trials where subjects exhibit lexicographic decision-making, stopping their search at the first discriminating cue based on validity. This 3-way mixture resolves failures in purely compensatory or tallying-based models by allowing individuals to probabilistically switch to a fast-and-frugal one-reason heuristic when cues strongly conflict, thereby better capturing empirical deviations from both WADD and Tallying.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3643 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3643.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0], B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
    # Trial 8: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0], B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
    # In these trials, Tally is tied (2v2 and 3v3). 
    # Non-linear scaling strictly preserves the ordinality of validities: A's transformed validities 
    # always sum to a higher value than B's, regardless of gamma (except at exactly gamma=0 where they tie).
    # Thus, Non-linear scaling almost invariably chooses A (response=0).
    # Strategy Mixture uses WADD with uniformly random subjective weights per feature. Because the weights 
    # are random, WADD will sometimes incorrectly prefer B, inflating the choice proportion of B.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate theory successfully implemented the 3-way mixture of Take-The-Best (TTB), Tallying, and WADD. However, the simulation results show a significant degradation in fit across several experiments (e.g., Experiments 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) compared to the reference theories. The primary issue lies in the WADD component: by multiplying the objective validities by a vector of uniformly distributed random weights ('w' bounded between 0 and 1), the model effectively scrambles the cue validities for each subject. This subjective weighting acts as unstructured noise rather than a meaningful compensatory integration of validities, severely hampering the model's ability to capture choices where subjects systematically rely on WADD-like compensatory strategies.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The WADD component is currently miscalibrated due to the random 'weights' vector multiplying the validities, which introduces excessive noise and destroys the ordinality of the cues. Regenerate the model by removing the random 'weights' array. Instead, WADD should directly use the provided 'validities' (e.g., `stim @ validities`), or optionally apply a single non-linear scaling parameter `gamma` (e.g., `validities ** gamma`) to capture subjective sensitivity. Keep the 3-way mixture (TTB, Tallying, WADD) intact, but fix the WADD score computation so that it faithfully represents compensatory integration."
