# Round 12 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Take The Best (Gigerenzer & Goldstein 1996).
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current
    # trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B. Cue cascade: features are consulted in order
    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )
    # Descending validity; argsort is stable so validity ties break
    # toward the earlier feature index.
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break

    if winner is None:
        # No discriminating cue — pure guess.
        return np.ones(2) / 2.0

    scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. For the
    # binary TTB score this collapses to sigmoid(beta) for the winner,
    # giving a direct mapping from beta onto the paper's flip-noise
    # levels (beta=0 ↔ 50/50; beta ≫ 1 ↔ deterministic).
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_14` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Decision-makers rely on a pure Tallying strategy, a non-weighted compensatory heuristic. They evaluate options by simply counting the total number of positive cues for each option, completely ignoring the validities of those cues. Choices are made probabilistically based on the difference in these unweighted tally scores, subject to decision noise (inverse temperature) and random lapses.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this proposes a pure Tallying (unit-weight linear) model. By completely ignoring cue validities and simply summing the positive features for each option, it provides a stark, fundamentally different compensatory baseline to contrast with the lexicographic Take-The-Best model. This will help identify variance from subjects using non-weighted, purely compensatory strategies.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Pure tallying: count total positive cues for each option
    tally_a = float(np.sum(a))
    tally_b = float(np.sum(b))
    
    scores = np.array([tally_a, tally_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over tally scores
    z = beta * scores
    z -= np.max(z)
    p_core = np.exp(z) / np.sum(np.exp(z))
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_15` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Decision-makers exhibit strategy heterogeneity, with choices generated by a mixture of a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive or WADD). To avoid unidentifiable parameter spaces that arise from mixing at the probability level, individuals integrate the evidence from both strategies before applying a single decision noise process. The combined evidence is scaled by a single inverse temperature parameter, allowing the model to smoothly capture highly deterministic choices without artificial compromises between strategy probabilities.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we widened the upper bound of the `beta` parameter from 20.0 to 50.0. Because the evidence differences (the gap between Option A and Option B scores after mixing) can be small—especially when `w_ttb` and WADD disagree—the softmax temperature needs to be able to scale higher to capture the highly deterministic choice probabilities observed in the empirical data. The rest of the evidence-mixing logic remains exactly as is.

**Parameters:**
  - `w_ttb`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.1]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    w_ttb = float(parameters["w_ttb"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Take The Best (TTB) evaluation
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")
    ttb_score = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            ttb_score = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[j] > a[j]:
            ttb_score = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    # Weighted Additive (WADD) evaluation
    sum_val = np.sum(val)
    score_a = np.sum(val * a) / sum_val
    score_b = np.sum(val * b) / sum_val
    wadd_score = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Mixture of evidence
    evidence = w_ttb * ttb_score + (1.0 - w_ttb) * wadd_score
    
    # Single softmax decision process
    z = beta * evidence
    z -= np.max(z)
    p_core = np.exp(z) / np.sum(np.exp(z))
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
