# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_14`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_14`).

Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) model or a Strategy Mixture model (e.g., mixing Take The Best and WADD). The pure Tallying model completely fails because it ignores cue validities, which subjects clearly use. A WADD model would integrate all available cues but weight them by their validities, allowing it to capture compensatory effects that pure TTB misses (like in Experiments 1, 4, and 19), while still respecting the dominance of higher-validity cues.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Decision-makers exhibit strategy heterogeneity, with choices generated by a mixture of a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive or WADD). WADD integrates all available cues but weights them by their validities, allowing it to capture compensatory effects that pure TTB misses, while still respecting the dominance of higher-validity cues. Both strategies are implemented probabilistically (via a softmax function) to prevent lapse noise from being misattributed to the wrong strategy. Individuals probabilistically select between these strategies on a trial-by-trial basis, with a small lapse rate for random errors.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- w_ttb: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta_ttb: [0.1, 15.0]
- beta_wadd: [0.1, 15.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.1]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, we applied two minimal adjustments to the previous Strategy Mixture base: 1) We replaced the deterministic 1.0/0.0 TTB probabilities with a softmax over the cue difference using a new parameter `beta_ttb`. This 'softens' TTB so that slight noise in a predominantly TTB-using subject's choices isn't misattributed to the WADD component, allowing `w_ttb` to remain high for those subjects. 2) We normalized the WADD scores by dividing by the sum of the validities. This ensures `beta_wadd` operates on a consistent scale across different experiments, preventing parameter estimation issues when the number of features varies.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4951 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4245 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.4245.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate implements the arbiter-prescribed Strategy Mixture model (TTB + WADD). While it provides a flexible framework, the model currently underperforms on experiments where subjects heavily rely on TTB (e.g., Exp 3, Exp 4, Exp 7). The candidate's simulated values on these experiments land roughly halfway between pure TTB and pure WADD, suggesting the parameter estimation is struggling to cleanly separate the strategies or is being forced into a compromise. A likely reason is that the TTB component is perfectly deterministic (probabilities of 1.0 and 0.0), meaning any lapse or slight deviation from TTB by a predominantly TTB-using subject forces the model to lower `w_ttb` and rely on the WADD component to explain the variance, muddying the mixture.
Rationale: To improve the fit within the prescribed Strategy Mixture family, make two minor adjustments: 1) Soften the TTB component by adding a temperature parameter (or reusing beta_wadd) so that TTB makes probabilistic predictions (e.g., softmax over the cue difference of the first discriminating cue) rather than hard 1.0/0.0 probabilities. This will prevent the model from misattributing TTB noise to the WADD component. 2) Normalize the WADD scores by the sum of the validities so that `beta_wadd` operates on a consistent scale across experiments regardless of the number of features.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4951 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.4245 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate successfully implemented the Strategy Mixture model with a softened TTB and normalized WADD, leading to a noticeable improvement in aggregate loss (0.4951 to 0.4245). However, the model still heavily underpredicts the extremity of subject behavior in experiments where choices are highly deterministic (e.g., Experiments 3, 5, 7, and 17). The candidate's simulated metrics are often pulled toward the center (0.4 - 0.6) when the empirical data shows strong directional preferences (e.g., Exp 17 real=-0.75, cand=0.40). This suggests that the model is still unable to achieve sufficient determinism, likely because the beta parameters are artificially capped too low or epsilon is injecting too much noise.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "To improve the fit within the prescribed Strategy Mixture family, we need to allow the model to make sharper, more deterministic predictions. 1) Widen the ranges of `beta_ttb` and `beta_wadd` significantly (e.g., [0.1, 30.0]). Because WADD scores are normalized by the sum of validities, the maximum difference is 1.0, and a beta cap of 15.0 may not be high enough to match the near-perfect consistency seen in some subjects. 2) Constrain the `epsilon` lapse rate to a tighter range (e.g., [0.0, 0.05]) so it doesn't artificially wash out the deterministic signals of the TTB and WADD components."
