# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_8`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_8`).

Propose a brand-new theory based on an Evidence Accumulation or Weighted Additive (WADD) framework with exponentially decaying weights. Instead of a discrete mixture of heuristics, assume that subjects integrate all cues but discount lower-validity cues heavily. If the decay is steep enough, it mimics TTB for most choices but still allows multiple aligned lower-validity cues to occasionally overcome a single higher-validity cue, capturing both the flat trends in Exps 1/2 and the compensatory behavior in Exps 10/11.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Decision-makers evaluate options by integrating all available cues, but they heavily discount the influence of lower-validity cues. Instead of using a discrete mixture of distinct heuristics (like pure Take The Best or pure Tallying), individuals employ an exponential decay weighting scheme based on cue validity rank. A steep decay mimics non-compensatory behavior (Take The Best), while a shallower decay allows multiple aligned lower-validity cues to outweigh a single higher-validity cue, producing compensatory behavior. This unifies strategy heterogeneity under a single rank-dependent weighted additive framework.

    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort cues by validity descending to determine rank
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")
    
    decay_rate = float(parameters["decay_rate"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

`parameters`:
- decay_rate: [0.01, 0.6]
- beta: [1.0, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, the parameter ranges have been adjusted to better capture the predominantly non-compensatory nature of human decision-making in these experiments. The `decay_rate` range is restricted to [0.01, 0.6], ensuring that the majority of simulated subjects rely on non-compensatory (TTB-like) strategies, while still allowing a smaller proportion to exhibit compensatory behavior. Additionally, the `beta` parameter range is increased to [1.0, 50.0] to allow the model to make more deterministic choices even when the score differences between options are small, which naturally occurs as the decay rate approaches 0.5.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4481 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2553 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.2553.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model implements the prescribed exponential decay WADD framework and was accepted by the gate. However, it severely underpredicts non-compensatory (TTB-like) behavior across multiple experiments. For instance, in Experiment 7 (where TTB and WADD strongly disagree), the observed proportion of TTB choices is 0.8256, but the candidate only predicts 0.3950. Similarly, in Experiment 5, the model predicts the wrong direction entirely. This occurs because the `decay_rate` is sampled uniformly from [0.01, 1.0]. Any `decay_rate` > 0.5 makes the model compensatory (the sum of lower cues outweighs the highest cue). Having ~50% of the simulated subjects be compensatory contradicts the empirical consensus that the majority of subjects use non-compensatory strategies. Furthermore, when `decay_rate` is near 0.5, the score differences between options become very small, causing the softmax function to produce overly stochastic choices given the current `beta` range.
Rationale: While the exponential decay framework is correct and should be kept, the parameter ranges need minor adjustments to better reflect the predominantly non-compensatory nature of the human data. First, restrict the `decay_rate` range to something like `[0.01, 0.6]` (or use a skewed transformation) so that the population remains largely non-compensatory while still allowing some compensatory behavior at the upper end. Second, increase the `beta` parameter range (e.g., `[1.0, 50.0]`) so that the model can still make deterministic choices when score differences are small (which happens when `decay_rate` approaches 0.5).

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4481 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2553 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current candidate successfully implements the exponential decay WADD framework with restricted parameter ranges, and it was accepted by the gate with a significantly improved loss (0.4481 -> 0.2553). The restriction on `decay_rate` to [0.01, 0.6] successfully captured the predominantly non-compensatory behavior (e.g., Exp 7 improved from 0.3950 to 0.7269, matching the human 0.8256 much better). However, the model now underpredicts compensatory behavior in some experiments. In Experiment 8, the real proportion of WADD choices is 0.4341, but the candidate predicts only 0.1577. In Experiment 5, the model still predicts the wrong direction entirely. This happens because a decay rate must be > ~0.518 for four aligned lower-validity cues to outweigh one highest-validity cue. With the upper bound at 0.6, only a tiny fraction of the simulated subjects exhibit this compensatory overcoming.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The exponential decay family is working well, but the `decay_rate` range is now slightly too restrictive, suppressing the compensatory behavior needed for Experiments 5 and 8. Widen the upper bound of the `decay_rate` slightly to `[0.1, 0.75]` or `[0.2, 0.7]`. This will maintain the majority TTB-like behavior (since values < 0.518 remain non-compensatory for most comparisons) while allowing a larger minority of simulated subjects to exhibit compensatory choices when multiple lower-validity cues align against a single higher-validity cue. Keep the `beta` range high (e.g., `[1.0, 50.0]`) to ensure deterministic choices."
