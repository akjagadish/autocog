# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_18") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_18" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_18
Decision-makers probabilistically alternate between a non-compensatory strategy (Take The Best) and a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive). To reflect the strong human tendency to rely on the single best cue in disagreement scenarios, Take The Best remains the dominant strategy (occurring at least 40% of the time). The secondary Weighted Additive strategy captures systematic compensatory shifts in a minority of trials. To ensure consistent sensitivity across experiments with varying numbers of cues and validity magnitudes, the WADD scores are normalized by the sum of validities, allowing the softmax temperature to operate on a consistent [0, 1] scale.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.96, 0.88, 0.8, 0.72, 0.64, 0.56]

**Trial pairs (n=7):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate pure Take The Best (TTB, the Advocated Theory) from the TTB-WADD Strategy Mixture Model (the Competing Theory), we systematically shift the highest-validity discriminating cue down the validity hierarchy while ensuring all lower-validity cues favor the opposing option. Pure TTB strictly stops at the first discriminating cue, completely ignoring its validity magnitude and all subsequent cues; thus, it predicts an identical, perfectly flat probability of choosing Option A across these trials. In contrast, the Competing Theory incorporates WADD, which evaluates the sum of validities. As the top discriminating cue shifts to lower validities, the number of opposing lower-validity cues decreases, causing the WADD score difference to shift from strongly favoring Option B to favoring Option A. Consequently, the Mixture Model predicts a monotonic increase in the probability of choosing Option A, directly contradicting the flat line predicted by pure TTB.

**Computed schedule:** 7 unique pairs × 13 reps = 91 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In Trial 1, Option A is favored by only the most valid cue, while Option B is favored by all remaining cues. In Trial 5, Option A is favored by the 5th most valid cue, and Option B is favored by only the 6th. Pure Take The Best (TTB) uses only the single highest-validity discriminating cue, so it predicts an identical, high probability of choosing Option A in both Trial 1 and Trial 5 (yielding a difference near 0). The Mixture Model, however, incorporates Weighted Additive (WADD) evaluation. For Trial 1, WADD strongly favors Option B due to the sheer number of opposing cues, dragging down the overall probability of choosing A. For Trial 5, WADD favors Option A, boosting the probability of choosing A. Thus, the Mixture Model predicts a positive difference between the probability of choosing A in Trial 5 versus Trial 1.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_18)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the TTB-WADD Strategy Mixture Model (Advocated Theory) from the pure Take The Best model (Competing Theory), we systematically vary the support from lower-validity cues while holding the highest-validity discriminating cue constant. Across the first four trials, the highest-validity cue (Feature 1) always favors Option A. Pure TTB bases its decision solely on this first discriminating cue, completely ignoring the remaining features, and thus predicts an identical, flat probability of choosing Option A across all these trials. In contrast, the Advocated Theory mixes TTB with a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. As we parametrically shift the lower-validity cues from strongly favoring Option B to strongly favoring Option A, the WADD component's preference reverses. Consequently, the mixture model predicts a monotonic increase in the probability of choosing Option A across these trials, directly contradicting the flat line predicted by pure TTB. Trials 5 and 6 replicate this logic when the first cue is tied, isolating the effect on the second-highest validity cue.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Under the pure Take The Best (TTB) model, the decision for trials 1-4 is entirely determined by the first cue (which always favors Option A). Thus, TTB predicts a constant probability of choosing A across these four trials. Similarly, for trials 5 and 6, the first cue is tied, so TTB relies entirely on the second cue (which always favors A), predicting a flat probability. In contrast, the TTB-WADD Mixture model incorporates compensatory information from the lower-validity cues, which shift from strongly favoring B (in trial 1 and 5) to strongly favoring A (in trial 4 and 6). Therefore, the Mixture model predicts a monotonic increase in the probability of choosing A as the compensatory support for A grows. This metric captures the difference in the proportion of choosing Option A between the high-support and low-support trials. The metric will be approximately zero for TTB and strictly positive for the Mixture model.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across Experiments 1 and 2, as well as many prior experiments (e.g., 8, 13, 23, 24, 29), Theory 1 (Pure Take The Best) consistently predicts the observed data much better than Theory 2 (TTB-WADD Mixture). Theory 2 repeatedly predicts large compensatory shifts (predicting metric values > 0.20) when the observed data remains flat and near zero, heavily supporting a strictly non-compensatory heuristic in these specific designs. However, in other experiments (like 11, 12, and 32), the observed data does show some sensitivity to lower-validity cues, which Theory 1 completely misses. Theory 2's global mixture with a Weighted Additive model is too blunt and over-predicts compensatory effects where they don't exist, failing to capture the specific conditions under which humans actually integrate secondary cues.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Theory 2 should be replaced entirely. A global mixture of TTB and WADD is too strongly compensatory and fails to capture the flat responses in Experiments 1 and 2. Propose a new theory that maintains a strictly non-compensatory, sequential cue-search framework but introduces probabilistic cue-skipping or a 'Lexicographic Semiorder' mechanism. For example, a model where decision-makers traverse cues in order of validity, but with a small probability of failing to discriminate on a valid cue (due to attention lapses or thresholding), causing them to fall back to the next cue. This would preserve the predominantly flat, TTB-like curves in most experiments while allowing lower-validity cues to exert a small, localized influence when top cues are 'skipped', better capturing the subtle compensatory effects seen in Experiments 11 and 32 without overpredicting them everywhere."
