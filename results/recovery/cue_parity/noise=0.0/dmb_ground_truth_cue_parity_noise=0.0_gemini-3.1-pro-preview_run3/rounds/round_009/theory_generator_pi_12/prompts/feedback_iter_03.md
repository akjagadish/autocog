# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_11`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_11`).

Propose a 'Strategy Mixture Model' theory. Instead of a single sequential sampling mechanism that tries to blend TTB and compensatory behavior on every trial, this theory should posit that the population consists of a mixture of decision strategies. On any given trial (or for any given subject), a non-compensatory strategy (Take The Best) is used with probability P_ttb, and a compensatory strategy (such as Weighted Additive or Tallying) is used with probability 1 - P_ttb. This will naturally capture the dominant 'flatness' in the data (via a high P_ttb) while still allowing for the small but robust compensatory effects seen in experiments where lower-validity cues strongly oppose the top cue.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Strategy Mixture Model: Decision-makers are heterogeneous and probabilistically select between distinct decision strategies on each trial. The population consists of individuals who predominantly rely on a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) but occasionally employ a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive) that integrates all available cue validities. By strongly favoring the non-compensatory strategy, this mixture captures the dominant flat, non-compensatory patterns in the data while still allowing for small but robust compensatory shifts when multiple weak cues strongly oppose the best cue.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    p_ttb = float(parameters["p_ttb"])
    beta_wadd = float(parameters["beta_wadd"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Take The Best (TTB) evaluation
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
    ttb_winner = -1
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            ttb_winner = 0
            break
        elif b[j] > a[j]:
            ttb_winner = 1
            break
            
    if ttb_winner == 0:
        ttb_probs = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif ttb_winner == 1:
        ttb_probs = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        ttb_probs = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    # Weighted Additive (WADD) evaluation
    wadd_a = np.sum(val * a)
    wadd_b = np.sum(val * b)
    wadd_scores = np.array([wadd_a, wadd_b])
    
    z = beta_wadd * wadd_scores
    z -= np.max(z)
    exp_z = np.exp(z)
    wadd_probs = exp_z / np.sum(exp_z)
    
    # Strategy mixture
    p_core = p_ttb * ttb_probs + (1.0 - p_ttb) * wadd_probs
    
    # Attentional lapses
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- p_ttb: [0.8, 1.0]
- beta_wadd: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Reverting the compensatory strategy back to Weighted Additive (WADD) and maintaining a high `p_ttb` prior ([0.8, 1.0]) preserves the successful baseline fit for the flat, non-compensatory experiments that was achieved in Iteration 2. To better capture the compensatory shifts in Experiments 5 and 17 without disrupting the overall TTB dominance, the `beta_wadd` range is widened to include lower values ([0.1, 20.0]). This allows for a softer, more probabilistic WADD component.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3339 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2104 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.2748 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2171 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.2104.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Strategy Mixture Model successfully improves upon previous iterations and was accepted by the loop, establishing a new running-best loss. However, a closer look at the simulated metrics reveals that the model systematically over-predicts compensatory effects. In experiments testing the 'flatness' of decision behavior (e.g., Experiments 6, 11, 12, 18, 19, 20), the empirical data shows near-zero differences in choice probabilities across conditions, indicating extreme non-compensatory behavior. The candidate model predicts differences in the 0.20-0.30 range, meaning it relies too heavily on the Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. Furthermore, in Experiment 5 and 17, the model's predictions are in the opposite direction of the empirical data.
Rationale: While the Strategy Mixture Model family is correct (per the Arbiter's recommendation) and has improved the loss, its parameters are miscalibrated. The mixture heavily overestimates the prevalence of the compensatory (WADD) strategy, leading to large predicted condition differences where human data is virtually flat. To fix this, restrict the `p_ttb` parameter range to strongly favor Take The Best (e.g., `[0.7, 1.0]` or `[0.8, 1.0]`). This will suppress the excessive compensatory shifts while still allowing WADD to capture the small, robust deviations. Keep the mechanism intact, but tighten the prior on `p_ttb` to align with the dominant non-compensatory pattern in the data.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3339 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2104 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Strategy Mixture Model successfully improved the overall fit, and restricting `p_ttb` to [0.8, 1.0] helped capture the flat, non-compensatory patterns in Experiments 6, 11-16, and 18-20. However, this high `p_ttb` combined with a Weighted Additive (WADD) compensatory strategy fails to capture the strong compensatory effects observed in Experiments 5, 8, and 17. In particular, Experiment 5 shows a strong negative Z-score when tallying strongly opposes TTB, and Experiment 17 shows a massive shift (-0.75) that the current model entirely misses (predicting +0.09). This suggests the compensatory component needs to be more sensitive to the sheer number of opposing cues rather than their validity-weighted sum, and it needs to be allowed to operate slightly more frequently.
Rationale: To capture the strong compensatory shifts in Exp 5 and 17 without losing the flatness in other experiments, make two minor adjustments within the prescribed mixture family: 1) Swap the compensatory strategy from Weighted Additive (WADD) to Tallying (unit weights, simply counting the number of positive cues for each option). Tallying often better captures human compensatory behavior when multiple weak cues oppose a single strong cue. 2) Slightly widen the `p_ttb` range to `[0.6, 0.95]` to allow the Tallying strategy to exert a stronger influence when cue differences are stark. Keep the softmax temperature (`beta_tally`) for the compensatory strategy to allow it to be deterministic when cue counts differ significantly.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2104 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.2748 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The previous attempt to swap the compensatory strategy to Tallying and lower the p_ttb range (Iter 3) was rejected by the gate. Lowering p_ttb to 0.6 compromised the model's ability to capture the dominant flat, non-compensatory baseline seen in the majority of the experiments (e.g., Exps 6, 11-16, 18-20). The running-best base (Iter 2) successfully captured this flatness by using WADD and keeping p_ttb high ([0.8, 1.0]). However, Iter 2 still under-predicted the compensatory shifts in Experiments 5 and 17.
Rationale: Since the Tallying + lower p_ttb combination was rejected, revert the compensatory strategy back to Weighted Additive (WADD) and restore the high p_ttb prior (e.g., [0.8, 1.0]) to maintain the successful baseline fit from Iter 2. To better capture the compensatory shifts in Experiments 5 and 17 within the WADD framework, adjust the softmax inverse-temperature parameter for WADD (e.g., `beta_wadd`). Widen its range to include much lower values (e.g., [0.1, 20.0]). A softer, more probabilistic WADD component can help smooth the compensatory predictions without disrupting the strong TTB majority.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.2748 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2171 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current candidate (Iter 4) attempted to capture the compensatory shifts by widening the `beta_wadd` range to [0.1, 20.0], but this was rejected by the gate, meaning it failed to beat Iteration 2's loss of 0.2104. Iteration 2 remains the running-best model. Iteration 2 successfully captured the 'flatness' in most experiments by keeping `p_ttb` high, but it still struggles with the magnitude and direction of the compensatory shifts in Experiments 5 and 17. The widening of `beta_wadd` in Iter 4 did not resolve this and slightly degraded the overall fit, likely because unnormalized WADD scores vary wildly across experiments with different numbers of cues, making a single `beta_wadd` parameter difficult to tune globally.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since Iteration 4 was rejected, the base resets to Iteration 2. To improve upon Iteration 2 within the Strategy Mixture family, we need to stabilize the Weighted Additive (WADD) component so it generalizes better across experiments with different cue counts. Keep the WADD strategy and the high `p_ttb` prior ([0.8, 1.0]). However, normalize the WADD scores before applying the softmax. Instead of `z = beta_wadd * wadd_scores`, use `z = beta_wadd * (wadd_scores / np.sum(val))` or standardizing the validities. This normalization ensures that the input to the softmax is on a consistent scale regardless of whether an experiment has 4 cues or 6 cues, allowing `beta_wadd` to find a single optimal range across all experiments. Set `beta_wadd` to a moderate range like [1.0, 10.0]."
