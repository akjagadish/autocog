# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Decision-makers rely on a Strategy Mixture of Take The Best (TTB) and a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. The probability of selecting a non-compensatory strategy (TTB) over a compensatory one (WADD) is sensitive to the global cue environment. Specifically, the mixing weight is determined by a logistic function of the 'validity gap'—the difference between the highest validity and the average of the remaining validities. By widening the sensitivity of this logistic transition, decision-makers can exhibit sharp, near-deterministic shifts between strategies depending on whether the best cue stands out significantly from the rest.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To dissociate pure Take The Best (TTB) from the TTB-WADD mixture model, we use a 5-feature design and parametrically vary the support from lower-validity cues while holding the highest-validity discriminating cue constant. Across the first three trials, the highest-validity cue always favors Option A, so pure TTB predicts a constant probability of choosing A. However, the WADD score systematically shifts from strongly favoring Option B to favoring Option A. The mixture model, which incorporates WADD, predicts a monotonic increase in the probability of choosing Option A across these trials, while pure TTB predicts a flat line. Additional trials apply the same logic when the first cue is tied, providing further points of divergence.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In all 5 trial types, the pure Take The Best (TTB) strategy favors Option A because the most valid discriminating cue always points to A. Therefore, TTB predicts a flat, low probability of choosing Option B across all trials (driven only by noise/lapses). However, the WADD strategy favors Option B in trials 1, 2, and 4, and favors Option A in trials 3 and 5. The competing mixture model incorporates WADD and thus predicts a systematically higher probability of choosing Option B on trials 1, 2, and 4 compared to trials 3 and 5. By measuring the difference in the proportion of B choices between these two sets of trials, we can cleanly separate the flat line of TTB from the WADD-influenced shifts of the mixture model.

    # when WADD favors B vs when WADD favors A.
    p_b_when_wadd_b = data[is_wadd_b]['response'].mean()
    p_b_when_wadd_a = data[~is_wadd_b]['response'].mean()

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_6)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design leverages a key quantitative divergence in how the two models handle choice confidence across different discriminating cues. In the pure Take The Best (TTB) model, choice probability is determined solely by the fact that *some* cue discriminated, yielding a binary score (1 for winner, 0 for loser); it completely ignores the validity of the discriminating cue, predicting a flat, constant confidence across trials as long as the top discriminating cue favors the same option. In contrast, the Advocated Theory's mixture model incorporates WADD, which integrates the validities of all cues. By systematically shifting which cue is the highest discriminating cue (e.g., from the 1st to the 5th) while keeping the lower-validity cues opposed, the pure TTB model predicts identical choice probabilities across all these trials. The mixture model, however, predicts a monotonic shift in choice probability because the WADD component's score difference changes drastically as more high-validity cues become tied.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In a pure Take The Best (TTB) model, the probability of choosing the option favored by the top discriminating cue is constant across all trials, regardless of the lower-validity cues. In the Advocated Theory's mixture model, the Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy influences the choice. By calculating the difference in the rate of choosing the TTB-favored option between trials where WADD supports TTB (positive WADD difference) and trials where WADD opposes TTB (negative WADD difference), we can measure the compensatory influence. This metric will be near zero for the pure TTB model and significantly greater than zero for the Advocated mixture model.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the ten experiments, pure Take The Best (THEORY 1) captures the high adherence to the best discriminating cue in several experiments (e.g., Exps 5, 8, and 9) where its point estimates are remarkably close to the observed data. However, THEORY 1 completely misses the compensatory influence of lower-validity cues observed in Exps 1, 2, 4, and 10. On the other hand, the environment-sensitive mixture model (THEORY 2) systematically overestimates the influence of the compensatory (WADD) strategy, failing to predict the strong TTB-like behavior in Exps 5, 8, and 9. Neither model captures the data perfectly, but the current mixture approach in THEORY 2 is too rigid and over-weights WADD. A completely new theoretical mechanism is needed to explain the weak, but reliable, compensatory influence observed in the aggregate data without losing the strong TTB baseline.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a new theory based on a population-level strategy mixture or an evidence accumulation process with a stopping rule. Instead of a trial-by-trial environment-sensitive logistic mixture (which over-predicts WADD), assume that the population consists of a stable mix of pure TTB users and compensatory users (e.g., Tallying or WADD). Alternatively, propose a sequential evidence accumulation model where decision-makers process cues in order of validity but have a probabilistic stopping threshold, allowing them to sometimes integrate lower-validity cues before deciding. This would produce the strong TTB baseline with a muted compensatory effect seen across the experiments."
