# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** The competing theory relies on a mixture of Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying. Because TTB is only sensitive to the highest validity discriminating cue and Tallying is only sensitive to the unweighted sum of cues, the competing theory predicts identical choice probabilities across any trials where the TTB winner and the Tally difference are both held constant. The advocated theory, however, evaluates options using a Leaky Competing Accumulator with configural weighting and non-linear transduction of all integrated validities. By fixing the top discriminating cue and the total number of cues for each option, but systematically varying the validities of the secondary cues, the advocated theory predicts graded, systematic shifts in choice probabilities. The competing theory strictly predicts flat, invariant responses across these matched trials.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Leaky Competing Accumulator with Non-linear Configural Weighting and Evidence Transduction: Decision-makers evaluate cues simultaneously, with evidence for each option dynamically inhibiting the other in a leaky competing accumulator (LCA). Cues have a configural impact, scaled non-linearly by the total number of supporting cues. Additionally, the integrated evidence for each option is passed through a non-linear transducer (alpha) before entering the accumulation process, allowing the model to amplify the differences driven by high-validity cues and capture strong non-compensatory reversals.

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [-10.0, 10.0]
- leak: [0.1, 2.0]
- inhibition: [0.0, 5.0]
- theta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- alpha: [0.1, 10.0]
- validities: validities

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Environment-Contingent Strategy Selection with Mean-Relative Dominant Cue Sensitivity: Decision-makers select between non-compensatory (Take-The-Best) and compensatory (Tallying) heuristics based on the structural properties of the environment. Specifically, the probability of deploying Take-The-Best increases as a logistic function of the difference between the top cue's validity and the average validity of all cues. In environments where the top cue strongly stands out from the overall cue distribution, individuals rely on TTB; when validities are relatively flat, they fall back to Tallying.

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [0.1, 50.0]
- threshold: [0.0, 0.5]

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

Since the experiment fixes the validities, this mixture probability is constant across all trials. For trials 3 and 4, the TTB winner is Option A and the Tally difference is exactly 0; thus, the competing theory strictly predicts identical choice proportions. The same logic holds for trials 5 and 7, where TTB favors A and Tally favors B by exactly 1 cue. The advocated theory, however, integrates the raw validities dynamically. It predicts that Option A is chosen more often in trial 3 than in 4 (because the secondary cue validity drops from 0.65 to 0.55), and more often in trial 7 than in 5 (because Option B's validities drop from 0.85+0.75 to 0.65+0.55). This metric sums these two contrasts, resulting in an expected value of exactly 0 for the competing theory and a large positive value for the advocated theory."
