# generation_iter_05_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_16`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_20`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_20`).

Propose a new theory that discards the problematic tally-difference-modulated exponential scaling. Instead, explore a Sequential Cue Sampling or Attention-Switching framework. In this new theory, decision-makers sample cues sequentially (prioritizing high-validity cues), and the level of conflict between options modulates the decision threshold (speed-accuracy tradeoff) rather than the cue weights themselves. This would allow the model to naturally capture both non-compensatory (fast decisions under low conflict) and compensatory (extensive sampling under high conflict) behaviors without introducing the mathematical artifacts and non-monotonic reversals seen in Theory 2.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_16` (overall score: 0.489)

**Description**
Leaky Competing Accumulator with Non-linear Configural Weighting and Evidence Transduction: Decision-makers evaluate cues simultaneously, with evidence for each option dynamically inhibiting the other in a leaky competing accumulator (LCA). Cues have a configural impact, scaled non-linearly by the total number of supporting cues. Additionally, the integrated evidence for each option is passed through a non-linear transducer (alpha) before entering the accumulation process, allowing the model to amplify the differences driven by high-validity cues and capture strong non-compensatory reversals.

### `pi_15` (overall score: 0.391)

**Description**
Environment-Contingent Strategy Selection with Mean-Relative Dominant Cue Sensitivity: Decision-makers select between non-compensatory (Take-The-Best) and compensatory (Tallying) heuristics based on the structural properties of the environment. Specifically, the probability of deploying Take-The-Best increases as a logistic function of the difference between the top cue's validity and the average validity of all cues. In environments where the top cue strongly stands out from the overall cue distribution, individuals rely on TTB; when validities are relatively flat, they fall back to Tallying.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.385)

**Description**
Decision-makers do not exclusively rely on a single decision rule; rather, choices reflect a probabilistic mixture of strategies on a trial-by-trial basis (or heterogeneity across individuals). The Strategy Mixture theory posits that a decision is made by selecting either a non-compensatory strategy (Take The Best) with probability alpha, or a compensatory strategy (Tallying) with probability 1 - alpha. Take The Best relies solely on the most valid discriminating cue, making it highly frugal and non-compensatory, whereas Tallying integrates information by counting the total number of cues favoring each option. By averaging across these two distinct decision rules, the model seamlessly bridges the non-compensatory invariance observed in Experiment 2 and the compensatory sensitivity observed in Experiment 1.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.3768 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3969 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.3976 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.3798 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.3937 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3768 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Sequential Cue Sampling with Conflict-Modulated Threshold: Decision-makers sample cues sequentially in order of their validities. Instead of integrating all cues simultaneously, they accumulate evidence until it reaches a decision threshold. Crucially, the level of conflict between the options (inversely related to the absolute tally difference) dynamically modulates this threshold. Under low conflict, the threshold is low, leading to fast, non-compensatory decisions (like Take-The-Best). Under high conflict, the threshold increases, enforcing extensive sampling and yielding compensatory behavior. This provides a natural speed-accuracy tradeoff without mathematical artifacts.

- theta_1: [0.0, 5.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's feedback, this new model discards the problematic tally-difference-modulated exponential scaling that caused mathematical artifacts and non-monotonic reversals in Theory 2. Instead, it implements a Sequential Cue Sampling framework where cues are evaluated in validity order. The core innovation is that the decision threshold (rather than cue weights) is modulated by the level of conflict between options. When conflict is low (large tally difference), the threshold drops, allowing the model to quickly terminate sampling and produce non-compensatory choices. When conflict is high (small tally difference), the threshold rises, forcing the model to sample extensively and act in a compensatory manner. This naturally captures the speed-accuracy tradeoff and seamlessly bridges TTB-like and Tallying-like behaviors.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the arbiter's prescribed Sequential Cue Sampling framework with a conflict-modulated threshold, and this architectural shift significantly improved the aggregate loss (Accepted by the gate). However, the model struggles with experiments where subjects exhibit strong compensatory/tallying behavior despite a small difference in tallies (e.g., Exp 13 observed=0.12 vs cand=0.81; Exp 28 observed=-0.33 vs cand=0.64). In these cases, a tally difference of 1 yields a conflict of 0.5. With the current parameter ranges (theta_1 up to 5.0), the threshold doesn't get high enough to force the model to sample the remaining cues, causing it to prematurely terminate and behave non-compensatorily (like TTB) when it should be tallying.
Rationale: The current mechanism is correct and should be kept, but the threshold calibration prevents it from capturing tally-dominant behavior under moderate conflict. Keep the exact same Sequential Cue Sampling mechanism, but make the following minor adjustments: 1) Increase the upper bound of `theta_1` (e.g., to 10.0 or 15.0) so the threshold can exceed the maximum possible accumulated evidence, forcing exhaustive sampling when needed. 2) Consider sharpening the conflict function (e.g., `conflict = np.exp(-tally_diff)`) so that a tally difference of 1 still produces a very high conflict state (e.g., ~0.36 instead of 0.5, or scale it differently) or just rely on the larger `theta_1` to amplify the existing 0.5 conflict into a high threshold.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3768 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3969 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate from iteration 2 was rejected by the gate because the aggregate loss worsened (0.3969 vs 0.3768). The degradation occurred because the exponential conflict function `exp(-tally_diff)` actually *reduced* the conflict signal for small tally differences compared to the previous inverse function (e.g., for a tally difference of 1, `exp(-1)` is ~0.37, which is lower than `1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5`). This lower conflict signal reduced the decision threshold, causing the model to terminate sampling even earlier and behave more non-compensatorily, exactly the opposite of the intended effect.
Rationale: The previous advice to use exponential decay was mathematically counterproductive. The proposer should build on the accepted iter 1 base by reverting the conflict function to `1.0 / (1.0 + tally_diff)`. To allow the model to capture compensatory behavior under moderate conflict, simply widen the upper bounds of the threshold parameters: increase `theta_0` to [0.0, 5.0] and `theta_1` to [0.0, 10.0]. This will give the optimizer enough room to scale the threshold above the maximum possible evidence (forcing exhaustive sampling) when the conflict is 0.5, without distorting the conflict function itself.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3969 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.3976 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate from iteration 3 was rejected by the gate, meaning the aggregate loss worsened compared to the running-best base from iteration 1. The core issue is that simply widening the threshold parameter bounds allows the model to sample more cues, but because the evidence accumulator is *weighted* by cue validities (`E += (a[j] - b[j]) * val[j]`), a high threshold turns the model into a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. However, the empirical data in experiments like Exp 13 and Exp 28 strongly indicates that under moderate/high conflict, subjects resort to *Tallying* (an unweighted sum of cues), not WADD. The current weighted accumulator prevents the model from accurately capturing this Tallying behavior even when it samples all cues.
Rationale: To capture the shift from non-compensatory to compensatory Tallying behavior within the arbiter's prescribed framework, we need to change the evidence accumulation from weighted to unweighted. 

Keep the exact same Sequential Cue Sampling mechanism and conflict-modulated threshold, but modify the evidence update to: `E += (a[j] - b[j])` (remove `* val[j]`). 

Why this works perfectly:
1. The sampling order is still prioritized by validity (`np.argsort(-val)`).
2. When conflict is low, the threshold is low (e.g., <= 1). The model stops at the first discriminating cue (which is the most valid one). This exactly mimics Take-The-Best (TTB).
3. When conflict is high, the threshold rises. The model samples all cues and sums them up unweighted. This exactly mimics Tallying.

Revert the parameter bounds to their tighter iter 1 ranges (`theta_0` and `theta_1` in `[0.0, 5.0]`) since unweighted evidence accumulates in integer steps, meaning a threshold of 5.0 is already high enough to force exhaustive sampling for up to 5 cues.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.3976 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.3798 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iteration 4's shift to unweighted evidence accumulation was a crucial step in the right direction: it successfully captured Tallying-dominant behavior under high conflict, as evidenced by the massive improvement in Experiment 13 (error dropped from 0.81 to 0.21). However, the candidate was rejected because it degraded performance on experiments where subjects strongly prefer Take-The-Best (TTB) even when the overall tally difference is zero (e.g., Exp 1). The flaw lies in how 'conflict' was calculated. By defining conflict purely via `tally_diff`, the model experienced 'high conflict' (and thus forced exhaustive Tallying) anytime the tallies were tied, ignoring the fact that a highly valid discriminating cue resolves conflict immediately for human subjects.
Rationale: To fix this while staying strictly within the arbiter's prescribed threshold-modulation framework, you must keep the unweighted evidence accumulation (which is mathematically necessary to produce Tallying) but REDEFINE the conflict signal. Instead of using `tally_diff`, define conflict based on the validity of the *first discriminating cue*. For example: `conflict = 1.0 - val[first_discriminating_cue]`. If the first discriminating cue is highly valid, conflict is low, the threshold remains low, and the model terminates sampling immediately (perfectly mimicking TTB). If the first discriminating cue is weak, conflict is high, the threshold rises, and the model samples exhaustively (yielding unweighted Tallying). Keep `theta_0` and `theta_1` in the `[0.0, 5.0]` range.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.3798 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.3937 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate from iteration 5 was rejected by the gate. The attempt to redefine the conflict signal based on the first discriminating cue failed to improve the aggregate loss. The core problem with the unweighted evidence accumulation introduced in iteration 4 (and kept here) is what happens when the tallies are tied. If the model samples all cues unweightedly, the accumulated evidence E perfectly cancels out to 0. The softmax then produces a 50/50 random guess. However, empirical data (like Experiment 1) shows that when tallies are tied, human subjects do not guess randomly; they fall back on the validity of the cues (Take-The-Best) to break the tie. Because the unweighted model completely discards validity during evidence accumulation, it mathematically cannot break ties, leading to severe underperformance on tied-tally trials.
Rationale: We need to return to the Iteration 4 conflict function but fix the tie-breaking flaw in the unweighted evidence accumulator. Revert the conflict function to `conflict = 1.0 / (1.0 + abs(sum(a) - sum(b)))`. To allow the model to Tally when tallies are unequal but use validity to break ties when tallies are equal, modify the evidence accumulation to include a small validity-based tie-breaker: `E += (a[j] - b[j]) + 0.1 * val[j] * (a[j] - b[j])`. This guarantees that the primary driver of E is the unweighted tally (capturing compensatory behavior under high conflict), but if the tallies perfectly cancel out, the `0.1 * val[j]` term ensures the option with the higher-validity cues wins out, preventing the 50/50 random guessing artifact. Keep the `theta_0` and `theta_1` parameter bounds at [0.0, 5.0].

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.3937 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "rationale": "Following the feedback, we retain the conflict-modulated threshold based on the absolute tally difference, but modify the evidence accumulation to primarily use unweighted sums ((a[j] - b[j])) so that under high conflict it closely mimics Tallying. To solve the issue of random guessing when tallies are perfectly tied, we add a validity-weighted tie-breaker (0.1 * val[j] * (a[j] - b[j])). This allows the model to fallback on validities (like TTB) to break ties while maintaining strong compensatory behavior when tallies are unequal. Parameters theta_0 and theta_1 are set to [0.0, 5.0] to provide appropriate threshold scaling."
