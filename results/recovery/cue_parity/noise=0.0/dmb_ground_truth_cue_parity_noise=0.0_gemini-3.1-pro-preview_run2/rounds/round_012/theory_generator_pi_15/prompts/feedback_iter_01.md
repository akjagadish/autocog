# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_14`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_11`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_11`).

Propose a brand-new theory based on an adaptive strategy selection or a configural weighting approach. Instead of a fixed sequential rule or a fixed exponential transformation, the new theory should posit that decision-makers assess the environment's structure (e.g., the variance or dispersion of cue validities) to dynamically switch between a non-compensatory heuristic (like Take-The-Best) when one cue strongly dominates, and a simpler compensatory heuristic (like equal-weights Tallying) when validities are similar or low. Alternatively, propose a parallel constraint satisfaction model where the subjective weight of a cue depends non-linearly on the agreement with other cues.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Adaptive Environment-Structured Strategy Selection: Decision-makers adapt their choice strategy based on the global statistical structure of the environment. Specifically, they evaluate the dispersion (e.g., standard deviation) of cue validities. In environments with high dispersion, they probabilistically favor a non-compensatory heuristic (Take-The-Best). In environments with low dispersion, they fall back to a simpler compensatory heuristic (Equal-weights Tallying). By removing artificial normalization from the Tallying score, the model can confidently predict compensatory choices when multiple cues align.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    theta = float(parameters["theta"])
    k = float(parameters["k"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Calculate dispersion of validities in the environment

    # Logistic function for strategy weight
    # Higher dispersion -> higher probability of using Take-The-Best

    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
    ttb_diff = 0.0

    scores_ttb = np.array([ttb_diff, -ttb_diff])
    
    # Tallying component
    # Removed normalization by len(val) to allow tally scores to naturally scale
    # and confidently predict compensatory choices without requiring a separate beta.
    tally_diff = float(np.sum(a) - np.sum(b))
    scores_tally = np.array([tally_diff, -tally_diff])
    
    # Convert scores to probabilities
    z_ttb = beta * (scores_ttb - np.max(scores_ttb))
    p_ttb = np.exp(z_ttb) / np.sum(np.exp(z_ttb))
    
    z_tally = beta * (scores_tally - np.max(scores_tally))
    p_tally = np.exp(z_tally) / np.sum(np.exp(z_tally))
    
    # Mixture prediction
    p_mix = w_ttb * p_ttb + (1.0 - w_ttb) * p_tally
    
    # Apply lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_mix + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- theta: [0.0, 0.3]
- k: [1.0, 100.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, I removed the normalization by `len(val)` from the Tallying score calculation. Previously, because Tallying scores were artificially compressed into a smaller range than TTB scores, the shared `beta` parameter resulted in the Tallying component producing much flatter (closer to random) probabilities. By letting `tally_diff` be the raw integer difference in cue sums, the model can now generate sharp, confident choice probabilities in compensatory environments, fixing the under-prediction of Tallying observed in Experiment 9.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3789 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4124 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3789.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The adaptive strategy selection model successfully decreased the aggregate loss and was ACCEPTED by the gate. By dynamically shifting between Take-The-Best and Tallying based on the dispersion of cue validities, it captures some of the variance across different environments. However, it still severely under-predicts the reliance on Tallying in compensatory environments (e.g., Experiment 9, where observed tally-matching is 0.889 but the model predicts 0.455) and fails to capture the direction of effects in Experiment 26.
Rationale: The current implementation has a critical scaling issue in how it calculates probabilities for the Tallying component. The TTB scores are discrete [-1.0, 1.0] (a difference of 2.0), while the Tallying scores are normalized by the number of cues, resulting in much smaller differences (e.g., 0.2 or 0.4). Because both components share the same `beta` parameter, the softmax for Tallying will always produce much flatter, more random probabilities than TTB. Even when the model correctly identifies a low-dispersion environment and sets `w_ttb` near 0, the resulting Tallying predictions remain too close to 0.5. To fix this while staying strictly within the prescribed family, introduce separate inverse temperature parameters (`beta_ttb` and `beta_tally`) so the model can confidently predict compensatory choices, or remove the `len(val)` normalization from the Tallying score so its scale naturally matches or exceeds TTB when multiple cues align.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3789 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.4124 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The recent attempt to fix the under-prediction of Tallying by removing the length normalization from the Tallying score was REJECTED by the gate, as it worsened the overall fit (loss increased from 0.3789 to 0.4124). While the raw tally difference allows for larger score magnitudes, it likely over-sensitizes the model to environments with many cues, disrupting the balance achieved in the first iteration. However, the core issue remains: the model still fails to confidently predict compensatory choices in environments where Tallying should dominate (e.g., Experiment 9).",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since removing the tally normalization degraded aggregate performance, the proposer should revert to the normalized Tallying score (as it was in iteration 1) but implement the alternative solution: introduce separate inverse temperature parameters (`beta_ttb` and `beta_tally`). This will allow the model to independently calibrate the confidence of the TTB and Tallying components without fundamentally altering the scale of the scores themselves. Ensure parameter ranges for both betas are wide enough (e.g., [0.1, 20.0]) to allow sharp deterministic choices when required."
