# generation_iter_08_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`

- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_13`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_11`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_13`).

Propose a 'Sequential Evidence Accumulation' or 'Validity-Ordered Tallying' theory. Instead of tallying first, decision-makers should evaluate cues in descending order of validity. Each cue provides evidence proportional to its validity (or a non-linear transformation of it). If the accumulated evidence difference between options exceeds a certain threshold, the search stops and a decision is made. A perfect validity cue (like 1.0) might instantly exceed this threshold (explaining Exp 1), whereas lower validity cues might require summing multiple features to reach a decision (explaining Exp 11). This reverses Theory 1's architecture: validities gate the process, and tallying/accumulation is the fallback when top cues aren't decisive enough.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.357)

**Description**
Decision-makers do not exclusively rely on a single decision rule; rather, choices reflect a probabilistic mixture of strategies on a trial-by-trial basis (or heterogeneity across individuals). The Strategy Mixture theory posits that a decision is made by selecting either a non-compensatory strategy (Take The Best) with probability alpha, or a compensatory strategy (Tallying) with probability 1 - alpha. Take The Best relies solely on the most valid discriminating cue, making it highly frugal and non-compensatory, whereas Tallying integrates information by counting the total number of cues favoring each option. By averaging across these two distinct decision rules, the model seamlessly bridges the non-compensatory invariance observed in Experiment 2 and the compensatory sensitivity observed in Experiment 1.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.294)

**Description**
Dual-Process Strategy Selection with TTB/WADD Fallback: Decision-makers evaluate the raw tally difference between two options first. If the tally difference is highly discriminative (greater than or equal to a threshold), they rely on the fast, compensatory Tallying heuristic. If the tallies are tied or very close, they switch to a more effortful strategy (WADD or Take-The-Best) and use an independent temperature parameter to scale the distinct evidence magnitudes.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.272)

**Description**
Sequential Cue Accumulation (Take-The-Best with Verification): Decision-makers process cues sequentially in order of validity, accumulating evidence for or against each option. They stop searching when the absolute accumulated evidence reaches a threshold. If the evidence reaches the threshold, a decision is made based on the accumulated evidence. However, if all cues are exhausted and the accumulated evidence fails to reach the threshold (e.g., due to highly contradictory cues), the decision-maker defaults to guessing. This captures the chance-like behavior observed in some compensatory settings while maintaining Take-The-Best behavior when early cues provide overwhelming evidence.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.4088 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3770 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.4303 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.4147 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.4372 -> REJECTED
- iter 6: loss=0.4500 -> REJECTED
- iter 7: loss=0.3789 -> REJECTED
- iter 8: loss=0.3779 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3770 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Sequential Evidence Accumulation: Decision-makers evaluate cues sequentially in descending order of validity. Each cue provides evidence proportional to a non-linear transformation of its validity above chance. Evidence is accumulated as a running difference between the two options. If the absolute accumulated evidence exceeds a threshold, search is terminated and a choice is made based on the current evidence. If all cues are evaluated without crossing the threshold, a decision is made based on the final accumulated evidence. This allows for fast, non-compensatory decisions when top cues are highly valid, while gracefully falling back to compensatory integration when early cues are less decisive.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)

        if diff != 0:
            E += diff * weights[j]
            # Stop if absolute accumulated evidence reaches the threshold

                break

def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- theta: [0.0, 10.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the critic's advice, we adjust the weight transformation to `weights = np.maximum(val - 0.5, 0.001) ** gamma`. Since validities are typically in the [0.5, 1.0] range, transforming them relative to chance (0.5) before applying the exponent provides much better contrast between high and low validity cues. This allows the model to flexibly flatten or steepen the weights. We also expand the range of `theta` to [0.0, 10.0] to allow the model to avoid early stopping and evaluate all cues when compensatory tallying behavior is required.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the arbiter's prescribed Sequential Evidence Accumulation model, where cues are evaluated in descending order of validity and search stops when a threshold is met. This provides a flexible bridge between non-compensatory (TTB-like) and compensatory (WADD/Tallying-like) strategies. The candidate was ACCEPTED and sets a new best loss. However, it still struggles significantly on pure tallying experiments (e.g., Exp 9 and Exp 13), where subjects rely heavily on the sheer number of cues rather than their validities. The current weight transformation `weights = val ** gamma` may not provide enough contrast between cues since validities typically range from 0.5 to 1.0, making it hard for the model to flexibly switch between steep validity-weighting and flat tallying within the given parameter ranges.
Rationale: To improve the fit on tallying-dominant experiments (Exp 9, 13) while remaining strictly within the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family, make two minor adjustments: 1) Change the weight transformation to `weights = np.maximum(val - 0.5, 0.001) ** gamma` to better separate high-validity from low-validity cues, allowing `gamma` to more effectively flatten or steepen the weights. 2) Expand the range of the threshold `theta` to [0.0, 10.0] so that the model can more easily avoid early stopping and evaluate all cues when compensatory tallying is required.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4088 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3770 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The previous advice to transform validities relative to chance (val - 0.5) was ACCEPTED by the gate and improved the aggregate loss, effectively bridging the gap towards tallying behavior in experiments like Exp 9 and Exp 11. However, this adjustment caused a significant regression on Exp 1 (TTB matches dropped from 0.62 to 0.48 vs real 0.74) and Exp 7. The issue is a scaling artifact: because `val - 0.5` is at most 0.5, raising it to a power of `gamma` shrinks the resulting weights exponentially towards zero. Consequently, the accumulated evidence `E` becomes very small, making the threshold `theta` (sampled from [0, 10]) practically unreachable. This unintentionally disables the early-stopping mechanism, forcing the model to evaluate all cues even when non-compensatory decisions are expected.
Rationale: To restore the early-stopping behavior required for Exp 1 while maintaining the improved contrast for tallying tasks, the cue weights need to be scale-invariant. Normalize the chance-corrected validities by their maximum before applying the exponent: `weights = (np.maximum(val - 0.5, 0.001) / np.max(np.maximum(val - 0.5, 0.001))) ** gamma`. This ensures the highest validity cue always has a weight of exactly 1.0, regardless of `gamma`. This makes the threshold `theta` structurally meaningful again (e.g., a `theta` slightly below 1.0 guarantees stopping after the first decisive cue). Adjust the `theta` parameter range to `[0.0, 5.0]` to densely cover both immediate stopping and full compensatory integration.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3770 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.4303 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The previous recommendation to normalize weights by their maximum was REJECTED by the gate. While it successfully restored non-compensatory, early-stopping behavior for Exp 1 (TTB matches rose to 0.73), it severely degraded performance on compensatory/tallying experiments (Exp 9, 11, 13, 15). By forcing the top cue to always have a weight of 1.0, the model became too eager to early-stop even when compensatory integration was needed, preventing it from evaluating all cues. The loop has safely reverted to the Iteration 2 base, which used `(val - 0.5) ** gamma`. We need a way to allow perfect cues (validity 1.0) to trigger early stopping without artificially inflating the weights of mediocre cues.
Rationale: Since the Iteration 3 candidate was REJECTED, the proposer will build on the Iteration 2 base. Iteration 2 struggled on Exp 1 because `val - 0.5` converts a perfect validity of 1.0 into 0.5, which shrinks exponentially as `gamma` increases, making it impossible to reach the threshold `theta` for early stopping. To fix Exp 1 while preserving the excellent tallying performance of Iteration 2, simply remove the chance-correction and use the raw validities: `weights = val ** gamma`. Because 1.0 to any power is 1.0, perfect cues will retain full strength and easily trigger early stopping when `theta <= 1.0`. Meanwhile, lower validities (e.g., 0.6) will shrink as `gamma` increases, providing the necessary flexibility to transition between tallying and WADD. Revert to `weights = val ** gamma` and keep `theta`'s range at `[0.0, 5.0]`.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.4303 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.4147 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate (Iteration 4) was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the loop safely reverts to the Iteration 2 base. The attempt to use raw validities (val ** gamma) failed because it compromised the model's ability to cleanly separate high and low validity cues for compensatory tasks, degrading the gains made in Iteration 2. The core issue with the Iteration 2 base remains: the chance-corrected weights `(val - 0.5) ** gamma` shrink exponentially as gamma increases, making the accumulated evidence E too small to ever reach the threshold `theta` (sampled up to 10.0). This unintentionally disables early stopping, causing poor fits on non-compensatory tasks like Exp 1.
Rationale: To restore early stopping for Exp 1 while preserving Iteration 2's excellent performance on tallying/compensatory tasks, we need to put the accumulated evidence on a predictable scale. Keep Iteration 2's chance-corrected weight transformation `weights = np.maximum(val - 0.5, 0.001) ** gamma`, but normalize the weights so they sum to 1.0: `weights = weights / np.sum(weights)`. Because the absolute accumulated evidence E will now naturally be bounded between 0.0 and 1.0, change the `theta` parameter range to `[0.0, 1.0]`. This ensures the threshold is structurally meaningful and reachable regardless of how much `gamma` shrinks the raw values, allowing the model to smoothly toggle between early stopping (small theta) and full integration (large theta).

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.4147 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.4372 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Iteration 5 candidate was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the loop safely reverts to the Iteration 2 base. The attempt to sum-normalize the weights failed because normalization introduces cross-cue dependencies: a cue's weight became dependent on the validities of the other cues in the experiment, which distorted the absolute evidence scale and ruined the model's performance on compensatory tasks. The core problem with the Iteration 2 base remains: `(val - 0.5) ** gamma` shrinks the highest possible validity (1.0) to 0.5 ** gamma, which vanishes for large gamma, artificially disabling the early-stopping mechanism needed for Exp 1.
Rationale: To fix the early-stopping behavior for Exp 1 without introducing the cross-cue artifacts of normalization, we must scale the validities independently. Instruct the proposer to map the chance-corrected validities to a [0.0, 1.0] range before applying the exponent: `weights = (2.0 * np.maximum(val - 0.5, 0.001)) ** gamma`. This simple fix ensures that a perfect cue (validity 1.0) always evaluates to 1.0 ** gamma = 1.0, allowing it to easily cross the threshold and trigger early stopping. Meanwhile, lower validities (e.g., 0.75 maps to 0.5) will correctly shrink as gamma increases, preserving Iteration 2's excellent tallying and compensatory behavior. Keep the `theta` parameter range at `[0.0, 5.0]` to allow both immediate stopping and full integration.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.4372 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.4500 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 6
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Iteration 6 candidate was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the loop safely reverts to the Iteration 2 base. The attempt to scale the weights by 2.0 (i.e., `(2.0 * (val - 0.5)) ** gamma`) failed because it implicitly multiplied the accumulated evidence `E` by `2^gamma`. Since `gamma` can be up to 10.0, this massively inflated the inputs to the softmax (`beta * E`), making choices artificially deterministic and ruining the model's calibration on compensatory tasks. The core problem with Iteration 2 remains: because `(val - 0.5) ** gamma` shrinks exponentially, the absolute value of `E` becomes tiny, making a fixed `theta` threshold impossible to reach and unintentionally disabling early stopping for Exp 1.
Rationale: To restore early stopping for Exp 1 without altering the scale of `E` (which would break the softmax `beta`), we should make the threshold relative to the weight scale. Keep Iteration 2's exact weight transformation: `weights = np.maximum(val - 0.5, 0.001) ** gamma`. Instead of a fixed `theta`, make the stopping condition relative to the highest validity cue's weight: `if abs(E) >= theta * weights[cue_order[0]]: break`. Set the `theta` parameter range to `[0.0, 2.0]`. This scale-invariant threshold guarantees that if `theta <= 1.0`, a single decisive top cue will instantly trigger early stopping (fixing Exp 1), while preserving the exact same `E` values for the softmax when `theta` is large, maintaining Iteration 2's excellent compensatory fit.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.4500 -> iter 7 candidate loss=0.3789 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 7
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Iteration 7 candidate was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the loop safely reverts to the Iteration 2 base. The attempt to make the stopping threshold relative to the *top cue's weight* (`theta * weights[cue_order[0]]`) failed to capture Exp 1. The reason is that if the top cue is tied (diff = 0), the search moves to the second cue. If `gamma` is large, the second cue's weight might be significantly smaller than the top cue's weight. Consequently, the accumulated evidence from the second cue might never reach a threshold based on the first cue, unintentionally disabling early stopping for all subsequent cues and failing to produce TTB-like behavior.
Rationale: To restore early stopping for Exp 1 without altering the scale of `E` fed into the softmax (which would ruin Iteration 2's compensatory fits), we should make the threshold relative to the *total possible evidence*. Keep Iteration 2's exact weight transformation: `weights = np.maximum(val - 0.5, 0.001) ** gamma`. Change the stopping condition to be relative to the sum of all weights: `threshold = theta * np.sum(weights)`, and set the `theta` parameter range to `[0.0, 1.0]`. This perfectly bounds the threshold: a `theta` near 0.0 guarantees the model will stop at the very first discriminating cue (restoring TTB for Exp 1), while a `theta` near 1.0 ensures the model evaluates all cues before deciding (preserving Iteration 2's excellent Tallying/WADD fits).

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 7 candidate loss=0.3789 -> iter 8 candidate loss=0.3779 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 8 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Iteration 8 candidate was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the loop safely reverts to the Iteration 2 base. The candidate successfully implemented the relative threshold (`theta * np.sum(weights)`) which logically restores early-stopping, yet it still failed to capture Exp 1 (TTB matches only reached 0.55 vs real 0.74). The reason is a softmax calibration collapse: when `gamma` is large, the chance-corrected weights shrink exponentially (e.g., 0.5^10 ≈ 0.001). Even when the model correctly stops early at the first cue, the absolute accumulated evidence `E` is so tiny that multiplying it by `beta` (max 20.0) still yields a value near zero. Consequently, the softmax outputs probabilities near [0.5, 0.5], causing the model to guess randomly rather than making the deterministic choice that Exp 1 requires.
Rationale: To fix the softmax collapse on Exp 1 while preserving the excellent compensatory fits of the Iteration 2 base, we must normalize the evidence scale before it enters the softmax. Re-implement the relative threshold from Iteration 8 (`threshold = theta * np.sum(weights)` with `theta` in `[0.0, 1.0]`), but crucially, divide the final scores by the sum of the weights before applying `beta`: `scores = np.array([E, -E]) / np.sum(weights)`. This guarantees that the inputs to the softmax are always on a stable [-1.0, 1.0] scale, regardless of how small `gamma` makes the raw weights. This allows the `beta` parameter to act as a true temperature, enabling deterministic TTB-like choices for Exp 1 while keeping the evidence accumulation logic perfectly intact.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 8 candidate loss=0.3779 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
