# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_16" and "pi_18") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_16" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_18" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_16
Leaky Competing Accumulator with Non-linear Configural Weighting and Evidence Transduction: Decision-makers evaluate cues simultaneously, with evidence for each option dynamically inhibiting the other in a leaky competing accumulator (LCA). Cues have a configural impact, scaled non-linearly by the total number of supporting cues. Additionally, the integrated evidence for each option is passed through a non-linear transducer (alpha) before entering the accumulation process, allowing the model to amplify the differences driven by high-validity cues and capture strong non-compensatory reversals.

## THEORY 2 — pi_18
Dual-Process Dynamic Attention Model: Decision-makers start by evaluating options using a fast, unweighted tallying process. If the relative tally difference (normalized by the number of cues) is large, this simple cue count drives the choice. However, when the initial relative tally difference is small or cues are conflicting, attention dynamically shifts toward the validities of the cues. In this later phase, cues are integrated proportionally to their reliability (validity). The decision-maker integrates the evidence (logits) from both processes before making a final choice, allowing for smooth compensatory behavior in high-conflict trials that scales consistently across environments with varying numbers of cues.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_16)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.75, 0.6, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=12):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  trial 9: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 11: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 12: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the advocated LCA model with Configural Weighting from the competing Dual-Process Dynamic Attention Model by exploiting their divergent handling of tied cues when the overall tally is matched. The competing theory posits that when the tally difference is zero, the model relies 100% on a linear validity-weighted sum (WADD); thus, adding cues that are tied (present for both options) adds equal validity to both sides, keeping the validity difference constant and predicting perfectly invariant choice probabilities across trials. The advocated theory, however, applies a non-linear configural weight to all cues based on the total number of cues favoring the option (sum ** gamma). By starting with a single discriminating cue pair and systematically adding tied cues to both options, the total sum increases, which non-linearly scales the effective evidence in the LCA. The advocated theory predicts a systematic shift in choice probabilities as the background tally increases, while the competing theory strictly predicts a flat line. Additional trials with large tally differences are included to exercise the competing theory's unweighted tallying component.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates trials where the unweighted tally difference is exactly zero (trials 1-5). Under the competing Dual-Process Dynamic Attention Model, a zero tally difference forces the model to rely entirely on the validity-weighted sum, which is mathematically identical across these trials. Thus, the competing theory predicts a flat line (difference = 0). The advocated LCA model, however, non-linearly scales the effective evidence of each cue by the total number of supporting cues (configural weighting). By subtracting the choice probability of A in low-tally trials from high-tally trials, we expose this non-linear shift predicted exclusively by the advocated theory.

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the advocated Dual-Process Dynamic Attention Model from the competing LCA theory by exploiting their divergent sensitivity to absolute versus relative validity sums. The advocated theory posits a linear integration of validities (WADD) mixed with a linear tally difference, where the mixture weight depends solely on the absolute tally difference. Consequently, it predicts perfectly invariant choice probabilities across any set of trials where the tally difference and the linear validity difference (V_A - V_B) are both held constant, regardless of the absolute magnitude of the validities. LCA, conversely, applies a non-linear transducer (alpha) and configural weighting (gamma) to the absolute sum of validities for each option. It predicts that adding a constant to the validities of both options (shifting V_A and V_B up while keeping V_A - V_B constant) will non-linearly scale the accumulated evidence, systematically changing the choice probabilities. By presenting sets of trials with constant tally differences and constant validity differences, but increasing absolute validities, the advocated theory strictly predicts flat, invariant lines, whereas LCA predicts systematic curves.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the overall proportion of trials where the subject chooses the option with the higher tally of positive cues. By design, in all trials, the option with the higher tally also has the higher sum of validities. The advocated Dual-Process Dynamic Attention Model structurally restricts its evidence weights (beta_tally and beta_val) to be strictly positive. Therefore, it consistently predicts that subjects will favor the option with the higher tally and validity, leading to a high expected accuracy (bounded only by the lapse rate epsilon, averaging ~87.5%). In contrast, the competing Leaky Competing Accumulator (LCA) model includes a configural weighting parameter (gamma) that is sampled from [-10.0, 10.0]. When gamma is negative, the LCA non-linearly penalizes options with more cues, causing the effective evidence for the higher-tally option to drop below the lower-tally option. Consequently, for roughly half of its parameter space, the LCA model strongly predicts that subjects will reliably choose the 'incorrect' lower-tally option. This creates a bimodal distribution of accuracy across subjects for the LCA model, dragging its expected mean accuracy down to ~50%. The massive difference in expected means (87.5% vs 50%) provides a highly robust and significant discriminator between the two theories.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.

  "interpretation": "Across the experiments, neither theory perfectly captures the observed data, but THEORY 1 (pi_16, LCA with configural weighting) generally captures the qualitative trends better than THEORY 2 (pi_18, Dual-Process Dynamic Attention Model). For instance, in Experiment 2, the metric evaluates how often subjects choose the higher tally option. The observed data shows a strong aversion to simple tallying (0.3504), which THEORY 1 captures more closely (0.6140) compared to THEORY 2's severe overestimation (0.8515). Similarly, in Experiments 16 and 21, THEORY 2 predicts high reliance on tallies (~0.85-0.89) whereas observed data shows much lower reliance (0.20-0.30). However, THEORY 1 still struggles to fully capture the extent of these effects and fails on some simple linear baseline tests. THEORY 2's structural commitment to always positively weighting tally and validities makes it too rigid. Thus, THEORY 2 is degenerate and should be replaced with a new theory.",

  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a new theory that moves away from the rigid dual-process mixture of unweighted tally and validity-weighted sums. The new theory should consider 'Cue-Depletion or Diminishing Returns Integration': instead of cues adding up linearly, each additional cue favoring an option provides logarithmically diminishing evidence, and cues might interact competitively. Alternatively, consider a 'Rank-Weighted Sequential Sampling' model where cues are evaluated in order of validity, but the stopping probability depends on the absolute difference in cue values. This would allow the model to sometimes stop early (ignoring tallies) or integrate heavily, capturing the low tally reliance seen in Exp 2, 16, and 21."
