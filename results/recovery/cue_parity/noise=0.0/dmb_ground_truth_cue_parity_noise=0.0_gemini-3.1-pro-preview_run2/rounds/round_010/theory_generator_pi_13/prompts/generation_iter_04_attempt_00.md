# generation_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_12`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_11`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_12`).

Propose a 'Two-Stage Tally-Threshold' theory. In the first stage, decision-makers compute a simple unweighted tally (sum) of the positive features for each option. If the absolute difference in tallies exceeds a subjective threshold, they choose the option with the higher tally, acting as a fast compensatory heuristic. If the tally difference is below the threshold (e.g., a tie or a difference of 1), they shift to a second stage where they evaluate the options using a weighted additive or lexicographic approach based on cue validities. This hybrid approach bridges the strong tallying effects seen in several experiments with the validity-driven choices observed in others, overcoming the limitations of pure TTB or pure WADD models.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.356)

**Description**
Decision-makers do not exclusively rely on a single decision rule; rather, choices reflect a probabilistic mixture of strategies on a trial-by-trial basis (or heterogeneity across individuals). The Strategy Mixture theory posits that a decision is made by selecting either a non-compensatory strategy (Take The Best) with probability alpha, or a compensatory strategy (Tallying) with probability 1 - alpha. Take The Best relies solely on the most valid discriminating cue, making it highly frugal and non-compensatory, whereas Tallying integrates information by counting the total number of cues favoring each option. By averaging across these two distinct decision rules, the model seamlessly bridges the non-compensatory invariance observed in Experiment 2 and the compensatory sensitivity observed in Experiment 1.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.327)

**Description**
Dual-Process Strategy Selection with TTB/WADD Fallback: Decision-makers evaluate the raw tally difference between two options first. If the tally difference is highly discriminative (greater than or equal to a threshold), they rely on the fast, compensatory Tallying heuristic. If the tallies are tied or very close, they switch to a more effortful strategy (WADD or Take-The-Best) and use an independent temperature parameter to scale the distinct evidence magnitudes.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.3862 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3641 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.3848 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.3690 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3641 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Two-Stage Tally-Threshold Theory: Decision-makers evaluate options using a fast, unweighted tallying heuristic as a first pass. If the difference in the number of positive features between the options meets or exceeds a subjective threshold, the decision is made based on this tally difference. However, if the options are tied or the difference is too small to be discriminative (below the threshold), the decision-maker shifts to a second, more effortful stage. In this fallback stage, they evaluate the options using either a weighted additive (WADD) or a lexicographic (Take-The-Best) approach based on cue validities. Evidence scores are normalized across strategies to share a single sensitivity parameter.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    fallback = str(parameters["fallback"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    tally_a = np.sum(a)
    tally_b = np.sum(b)
    n_features = len(a)
    
    if abs(tally_a - tally_b) >= threshold:
        # Normalize tally scores to [0, 1] to calibrate with fallback scales
        scores = np.array([tally_a, tally_b]) / n_features
    else:
        if fallback == "WADD":
            # Normalize validities so WADD scores are in [0, 1]
            val_norm = val / np.sum(val)
            scores = np.array([np.sum(val_norm * a), np.sum(val_norm * b)])
        else:  # TTB
            cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
            winner = -1
            for j in cue_order:
                if a[j] > b[j]:
                    winner = 0
                    break
                elif b[j] > a[j]:
                    winner = 1
                    break
            if winner == 0:
                scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            elif winner == 1:
                scores = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            else:
                scores = np.array([0.0, 0.0])
                
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- threshold: {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}
- fallback: {"WADD", "TTB"}
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the critic's advice, I expanded the set of possible thresholds up to 5.0. This allows the model to only use tallying for very obvious tally differences (such as 3 or more), which addresses the severe misses in Experiments 19 and 20 where subjects actually use validity-based reasoning despite a tally difference of 2. Furthermore, I linked `beta_tally` and `beta_fallback` into a single `beta` parameter to reduce overfitting. To make this shared beta work across different score scales, I normalized the tally scores (by dividing by n_features) and the WADD scores (by normalizing the validities to sum to 1), calibrating all evidence scores to a [0, 1] range.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Two-Stage Tally-Threshold model successfully integrates a compensatory fast-and-frugal heuristic (tallying) with a validity-based fallback (WADD/TTB), leading to a new best aggregate loss. However, it still struggles on several specific experiments. For example, in Experiment 20, the observed metric is 0.8700, but the simulated value is -0.3283, indicating that the model's thresholding behavior might be too rigid or triggering tallying when subjects actually use validity-based reasoning. Similarly, in Experiment 19, the simulated value (0.8383) overshoots the observed value (0.3050).
Rationale: The candidate has been ACCEPTED by the gate because it improves the aggregate loss, but there is room for further refinement within the prescribed family. The strict thresholding currently causes severe misses on experiments where tally differences are large but validities strongly point the other way (e.g., Exp 19 and 20). Please refine the parameterization: consider allowing higher thresholds (e.g., up to 4 or 5) so that tallying is only used for very obvious differences, or allow the threshold to be a continuous parameter. Additionally, you might want to link `beta_tally` and `beta_fallback` into a single `beta` parameter to reduce overfitting, or adjust the fallback WADD to use normalized validities to better calibrate the logit scales.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3862 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3641 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Two-Stage Tally-Threshold model with a shared beta parameter and expanded thresholds was ACCEPTED by the gate, achieving a new best aggregate loss. However, while it improved on some experiments, it exacerbated misfits in others where strong tallying behavior is expected (e.g., Exp 13). In Exp 13, humans overwhelmingly choose the higher-tally option despite validities pointing the other way (real = 0.1240), but the model predicts 0.5920. This happens because dividing tally scores by `n_features` shrinks the score difference (e.g., a difference of 1 becomes 0.2). When using a shared beta, this small difference makes tally-based decisions far too noisy compared to TTB fallback decisions (which have a score difference of 1.0).
Rationale: The attempt to link beta_tally and beta_fallback into a single parameter caused a scaling imbalance. Because tally scores were normalized by dividing by n_features, a tally difference of 1 provides much weaker evidence (logit difference of 0.2 * beta) than a TTB fallback (logit difference of 1.0 * beta). This makes the first-stage tallying heuristic artificially noisy. Please revise the parameterization: either revert to using separate `beta_tally` and `beta_fallback` parameters, or remove the `n_features` division for tally scores so that integer tally differences have a suitably strong impact. Keep the expanded threshold range and the overall two-stage structure.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3641 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.3848 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was REJECTED by the gate, as the aggregate loss increased from 0.3641 (iter 2) to 0.3848. The attempt to separate `beta_tally` and `beta_fallback` and remove tally normalization successfully increased the strength of tallying (e.g., Exp 14 improved slightly towards the real value), but it severely damaged the fit on experiments relying on fallback strategies, such as Exp 20 (dropped from 0.3650 to 0.1333, real=0.8700). The independent betas likely over-parameterized the model and broke the relative scaling between the two stages, leading to overly deterministic or overly noisy choices depending on the stage.
Rationale: Since the previous advice to use separate betas was rejected, we will build on the accepted iter 2 base which uses a shared beta. To fix the scaling imbalance between tallying and the fallback stage without adding extra parameters, we should adjust how the fallback scores are computed so they naturally align with the tally scale. Keep the shared `beta` and the unweighted integer tally scores. However, for the TTB fallback, instead of assigning hardcoded scores of [1.0, 0.0], assign the validity of the discriminating cue to the winner (e.g., if cue j discriminates, scores = [val[j], 0.0] or [0.0, val[j]]). For WADD, use the raw sum of validities without normalizing them to 1. This ensures that the fallback evidence scales with the actual cue validities, allowing a single `beta` to smoothly calibrate both stages.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.3848 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.3690 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was REJECTED by the gate (loss increased to 0.3690). While the attempt to fix the scaling imbalance by using unnormalized tally scores and scaling the fallback by cue validities was logically sound, it appears to have made the TTB fallback too weak. By using the single discriminating cue's validity (e.g., 0.7) for TTB, the fallback evidence became weaker than a minimal tally difference of 1, throwing off the balance. We need to perfectly align the scales of the two stages so that a single shared beta works optimally.
Rationale: Build on the accepted Iteration 2 base. Keep the shared `beta` parameter and use unnormalized integer tally scores (so tally differences are 1, 2, etc.) to ensure tallying is not artificially noisy. However, to perfectly align the scales, revert the TTB fallback to outputting standard [1.0, 0.0] scores, and let WADD output the raw sum of validities (e.g., `np.sum(val * a)`). This ensures that a definitive TTB decision (difference of 1.0) has exactly the same weight as a tally difference of 1, allowing the shared `beta` to calibrate both stages equally well. Additionally, restrict the `threshold` parameter to `{1, 2, 3}` to ensure the model doesn't devolve into pure fallback by setting unrealistically high thresholds.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.3690 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
