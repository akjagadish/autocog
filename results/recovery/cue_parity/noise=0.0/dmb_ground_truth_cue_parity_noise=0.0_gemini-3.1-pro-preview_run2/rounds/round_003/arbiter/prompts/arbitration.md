# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_3") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Sequential Cue Accumulation (Take-The-Best with Verification): Decision-makers process cues sequentially in order of validity, accumulating evidence for or against each option. They stop searching when the absolute accumulated evidence reaches a threshold. If the evidence reaches the threshold, a decision is made based on the accumulated evidence. However, if all cues are exhausted and the accumulated evidence fails to reach the threshold (e.g., due to highly contradictory cues), the decision-maker defaults to guessing. This captures the chance-like behavior observed in some compensatory settings while maintaining Take-The-Best behavior when early cues provide overwhelming evidence.

## THEORY 2 — pi_3
Weighted Additive (WADD) theory with non-linear scaling posits that decision-makers integrate all available information by weighting each feature by its validity, but subjectively scale these validities to adjust the degree of compensation. By exponentiating validities by a parameter gamma and then normalizing them, the model flexibly interpolates between equal weighting (Tallying), proportional weighting, and highly non-compensatory weighting (Take The Best) while keeping the integrated scores on a stable scale. Choices are made probabilistically using a softmax over the options' scores.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates Sequential Cue Accumulation (SCA / Take-The-Best with Verification) from Weighted Additive (WADD) theory by probing for a 'dead zone' of guessing. SCA posits a threshold of evidence; if the accumulated evidence across all cues fails to reach this threshold (e.g., due to highly contradictory cues), the decision-maker defaults to exact 50/50 guessing. WADD, conversely, always computes a graded choice probability based on the integrated score difference, no matter how small. By presenting a spectrum of trials with highly contradictory cues that result in very small but non-zero net validity differences, SCA predicts a flat 50% choice rate for all trials falling under the threshold, whereas WADD predicts a smooth, graded curve of probabilities that strictly tracks the small variations in net evidence.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the choice rate from 0.5 across the six trials with highly contradictory cues and small net validity differences. Under Sequential Cue Accumulation (SCA), the evidence in these trials frequently fails to reach the threshold, triggering the 'dead zone' where the model defaults to exactly 50/50 guessing. Consequently, the empirical choice rates for SCA will tightly cluster around 0.5 (reflecting only binomial noise). Under Weighted Additive (WADD) theory, the model always integrates the cues into a graded probability that diverges from 0.5 based on the non-linear scaling of validities, leading to a systematically higher absolute deviation from 0.5.

  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates Weighted Additive (WADD) theory from Sequential Cue Accumulation (SCA / Take-The-Best with Verification) by probing for 'early stopping' behavior. SCA assumes decision-makers accumulate evidence sequentially by validity and stop searching as soon as a threshold is reached. If the first few high-validity cues strongly favor one option and exceed this threshold, SCA completely ignores all remaining lower-validity cues, predicting identical choice probabilities across trials regardless of how the remaining cues are distributed. WADD, by contrast, integrates all information. It predicts that choice probabilities will systematically shift as the distribution of lower-validity cues changes, even when the top cues provide overwhelming evidence. By fixing the top two highly valid cues to favor Option A and systematically varying whether the remaining four cues favor A or B, we can cleanly test whether lower-validity cues are ignored (SCA) or integrated (WADD).

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the 'determinism' of choices on the most highly conflicting trials (Trials 6, 7, and 8). In these trials, the highest validity cue favors Option A, but the next highest validity cue favors Option B, and the remaining cues are distributed differently. Sequential Cue Accumulation (SCA) processes these cues sequentially. Because the cues alternate in supporting A and B, the accumulated evidence constantly fluctuates around zero and is very likely to never reach the decision threshold, causing the SCA model to default to random guessing (P = 0.5). Weighted Additive (WADD) theory, however, integrates all cues into a single compensatory score. Depending on the subjective scaling (gamma), one option will consistently outscore the other, leading to highly deterministic choices (P near 0 or 1, subject only to epsilon noise). By measuring the absolute deviation of the choice proportion from 0.5 on these specific trials, we can cleanly separate the guessing behavior of SCA from the deterministic integration of WADD, while keeping between-subject variance low.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the experiments, neither theory consistently captures human behavior. While Weighted Additive (WADD, pi_3) performs better on Experiments 1, 2, and 5 by predicting a graded response rather than a flat threshold, both theories completely fail on Experiments 7 and 8. In Experiment 8, subjects choose the Take-The-Best (TTB) winner at chance levels (0.49), contradicting both WADD (which predicts ~0.79) and Sequential Cue Accumulation (which predicts ~0.65). In Experiment 7, the observed metric is strongly negative (-0.43), whereas both models predict positive values. This indicates that subjects are not heavily weighting the top cues as both WADD (with gamma scaling) and SCA assume. Instead, they appear to be relying heavily on simple Tallying (counting the number of positive features) and largely ignoring the provided validities unless there is a tie in the tally. The current formulation of SCA (pi_5) is degenerate because its thresholding mechanism fails to capture the compensatory nature of the data, yet WADD also overweights validity.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Tallying with Validity Tie-Breaking' (or 'Equal Weighting') theory. This theory should posit that decision-makers primarily ignore the explicit validities and simply count the number of positive cues for each option (Tallying). If one option has more positive cues, it is chosen. Only if the tally is tied do subjects fall back to using the validities (e.g., by comparing the highest valid cue or computing a weighted sum). This explains why the TTB winner is chosen at chance in Exp 8 (where the TTB winner often has fewer or equal total cues) and captures the strongly different behavior in Exp 7."
