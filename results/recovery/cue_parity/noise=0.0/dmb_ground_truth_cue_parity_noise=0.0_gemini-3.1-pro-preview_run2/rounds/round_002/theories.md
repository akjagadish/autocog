# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Decision-makers do not exclusively rely on a single decision rule; rather, choices reflect a probabilistic mixture of strategies on a trial-by-trial basis (or heterogeneity across individuals). The Strategy Mixture theory posits that a decision is made by selecting either a non-compensatory strategy (Take The Best) with probability alpha, or a compensatory strategy (Tallying) with probability 1 - alpha. Take The Best relies solely on the most valid discriminating cue, making it highly frugal and non-compensatory, whereas Tallying integrates information by counting the total number of cues favoring each option. By averaging across these two distinct decision rules, the model seamlessly bridges the non-compensatory invariance observed in Experiment 2 and the compensatory sensitivity observed in Experiment 1.

**Rationale:** Based on the arbiter's feedback, the previous models (like TTB and Tallying) act as extremes that either entirely ignore compensatory information or entirely ignore cue validities, leading to polarized misfits across the experiments. This proposal instantiates a Strategy Mixture model. It computes the choice probabilities for both Take The Best and Tallying, and then mixes them using the parameter 'alpha'. Since TTB and Tallying bound the true empirical values from opposite sides across Experiments 1, 2, and 3, a weighted average of their predictions allows the model to accurately capture the specific degrees of compensatory and non-compensatory behavior exhibited by human subjects.

**Parameters:**
  - `alpha`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) theory with non-linear scaling posits that decision-makers integrate all available information by weighting each feature by its validity, but subjectively scale these validities to adjust the degree of compensation. By exponentiating validities by a parameter gamma and then normalizing them, the model flexibly interpolates between equal weighting (Tallying), proportional weighting, and highly non-compensatory weighting (Take The Best) while keeping the integrated scores on a stable scale. Choices are made probabilistically using a softmax over the options' scores.

**Rationale:** Addressed the critic's feedback by normalizing the weights after exponentiation (`weights = weights / np.sum(weights)`) and expanding the `gamma` range up to 30.0. This prevents the fractional validities from shrinking to zero when raised to a high power, ensuring the weighted scores remain on a stable scale. This allows the `beta` parameter to properly control the determinism of the choice probabilities and stops them from collapsing to 50/50, letting the model fully express strong non-compensatory (TTB-like) behavior.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 30.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    import numpy as np

        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Non-linear scaling of validities with normalization to prevent score shrinkage
    weights = val ** gamma
    weights = weights / np.sum(weights)
    
    # Calculate overall scores by weighting features by their scaled validity
    a_score = np.dot(a, weights)
    b_score = np.dot(b, weights)
    scores = np.array([a_score, b_score])

## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Sequential Cue Accumulation (Take-The-Best with Verification): Decision-makers process cues sequentially in order of validity, accumulating evidence for or against each option. They stop searching when the absolute accumulated evidence reaches a threshold. If the evidence reaches the threshold, a decision is made based on the accumulated evidence. However, if all cues are exhausted and the accumulated evidence fails to reach the threshold (e.g., due to highly contradictory cues), the decision-maker defaults to guessing. This captures the chance-like behavior observed in some compensatory settings while maintaining Take-The-Best behavior when early cues provide overwhelming evidence.

**Rationale:** Applying the minimal edit suggested by the critic: we modify the accumulation loop so that if all cues are exhausted and the final absolute accumulated evidence is still below the threshold `theta`, the model defaults to a uniform guess rather than applying the softmax. This directly addresses the failure to capture chance-like behavior in Experiment 2 when evidence falls below the threshold, while preserving the Take-The-Best behavior when the threshold is met.

**Parameters:**
  - `theta`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
