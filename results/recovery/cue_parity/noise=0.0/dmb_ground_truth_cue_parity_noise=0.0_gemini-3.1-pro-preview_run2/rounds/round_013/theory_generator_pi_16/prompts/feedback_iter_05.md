# feedback_iter_05

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_14`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_15`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_14`).

Replace the Sequential Evidence Accumulation theory with a Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) or Leaky Competing Accumulator (LCA) theory. The new theory should posit that all cues are evaluated simultaneously (compensatory), but the evidence for each option dynamically inhibits the other. Additionally, the weight of each cue could be non-linearly dependent on the presence of other cues (configural weighting), allowing the model to capture the counter-intuitive reversals seen in Experiment 2 and the strong compensatory shifts in Experiment 1 without relying on rigid early-stopping thresholds.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Leaky Competing Accumulator with Contrast-Based Configural Weighting: Decision-makers evaluate all cues simultaneously, but the evidence for each option dynamically inhibits the other in a leaky competing accumulator (LCA) framework. Furthermore, cues do not contribute independently; instead, their impact is configural. The effective weight of each cue is scaled non-linearly by its relative contribution to the option's total evidence. This allows the model to capture strong non-compensatory reversals, as it can heavily discount cues that are just one of many, while allowing a single strong cue to retain its full weight.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)

    inhibition = float(parameters["inhibition"])
    theta = float(parameters["theta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    sum_val_b = np.sum(val * b)

        dx_b = (I_B - leak * x_b - inhibition * x_a) * dt

    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()

`parameters`:
- gamma: [-5.0, 5.0]
- leak: [0.1, 2.0]
- inhibition: [0.0, 5.0]
- theta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, the configural weighting mechanism was updated from a tally-based scaling to a contrast-based scaling (`w_a = val * (val / max(1e-6, np.sum(val * a))) ** gamma`). If gamma > 0, this mechanism enhances cues that dominate their option's evidence (e.g., a single strong cue retains its full weight) while heavily discounting cues that are just one of many (e.g., three weak cues will have their weights suppressed). This provides a highly stable, single-parameter knob to interpolate between purely compensatory accumulation and strong non-compensatory discounting, directly addressing the failures in Experiments 20, 27, and 28.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3762 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3219 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.4317 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.3319 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.3262 -> REJECTED
- iter 6 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3308 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3219.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory successfully implemented the prescribed Leaky Competing Accumulator (LCA) with configural weighting, and it improved the overall aggregate loss (ACCEPTED by the gate). However, a closer look at the experiment-level simulations reveals stark failures in capturing non-compensatory reversals. In Experiment 2, humans often choose the option with fewer but higher-validity cues (observed = 0.2881 match with tally), whereas the candidate heavily favors the tally (0.8098). Similar severe mispredictions occur in Experiment 20 (observed = 0.8700, candidate = -0.4350) and Experiment 28 (observed = -0.3346, candidate = 0.5947). This indicates that the current configural weighting mechanism is too compensatory and fails to properly discount the accumulation of multiple weak cues.
Rationale: While the LCA family is correct and should be kept, the specific configural weighting equation (`1.0 + gamma * max(0.0, sum_a - 1.0)`) is problematic. It can produce negative weights if gamma is negative and sum_a is large, leading to erratic behavior, and it fails to generate the strong non-compensatory behavior seen in human data. Replace the linear scaling with a safer, more expressive non-linear function (e.g., `w_a = val * (sum_a ** gamma)` or `val * exp(gamma * sum_a)`) to ensure weights remain strictly positive while allowing for strong diminishing returns. Additionally, widen the range for `inhibition` and `gamma` to allow the model to strongly suppress weak cues when a high-validity cue is present.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3762 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3219 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory improved the aggregate loss (0.3762 -> 0.3219) and successfully implemented the non-linear configural weighting. It shifted predictions in the right direction for non-compensatory experiments (e.g., Exp 2, Exp 20, Exp 28). However, it still fails to fully capture the magnitude of these effects, particularly in Experiment 20 (observed = 0.8700, candidate = 0.3483), Experiment 27 (observed = 0.7800, candidate = 0.1483), and Experiment 28 (observed = -0.3346, candidate = 0.4489). The current configural weighting `w_a = val * (sum_a ** gamma)` discounts ALL cues equally when gamma is negative and multiple cues are present. This means adding weak cues inappropriately reduces the absolute evidence contributed by a high-validity cue.
Rationale: Refine the configural weighting mechanism so that the presence of multiple cues selectively suppresses the WEAKER cues rather than penalizing the strongest cue. For example, scale the validities by their relative strength: `w_a = val * (val / np.max(val)) ** (gamma * sum_a)` or use a softmax-like competitive normalization among the present cues. This will allow the model to retain the full impact of a single high-validity cue while heavily discounting the accumulation of multiple weak cues, bringing predictions for Experiments 20, 27, and 28 closer to the human ground truth.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3219 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.4317 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was REJECTED by the accept gate, as its aggregate loss worsened (0.4317 vs the running-best 0.3219). The attempt to selectively suppress weaker cues using `rel_val ** (gamma * sum_a)` failed, likely because the mathematical formulation was too extreme or unstable, causing predictions to overshoot or collapse in several experiments (e.g., Exp 11 shot up to 0.8267, Exp 9 dropped to 0.4317). The model needs a more stable way to implement configural weighting that still allows for non-compensatory behavior without erratic scaling.
Rationale: Since the previous relative-suppression scheme was rejected by the gate, we should abandon that specific mathematical formulation. Instead, return to the simpler, more stable base from iteration 2, but try a divisive normalization approach for the configural weighting. For example, use `w_a = val / (1.0 + gamma * sum_a)` (ensuring the denominator is strictly positive) or `w_a = val * exp(-gamma * sum_a)`. This provides a stable, bounded way to implement diminishing returns for multiple cues (when gamma > 0) or synergistic effects (when gamma < 0), helping to capture the non-compensatory shifts in Experiments 20, 27, and 28 without the instability of the rejected candidate. Keep the core LCA framework exactly as prescribed.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.4317 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.3319 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate using exponential configural weighting was REJECTED by the gate because its aggregate loss (0.3319) failed to beat the Iteration 2 base (0.3219). While it was more stable than Iteration 3, it still fails to capture the strong non-compensatory (Take-The-Best-like) behavior required for Experiments 20, 27, and 28. The loop will automatically revert to the Iteration 2 base, which uses the power-law configural weighting `sum_a ** gamma`. Tinkering purely with the configural weighting function's shape has reached a dead end for capturing these extreme reversals.
Rationale: To capture the strong non-compensatory behavior without destabilizing the configural weighting, we should allow the model to directly amplify high-validity cues. Build on the Iteration 2 base (which the loop has reverted to) and introduce a new parameter `kappa` (range [0.1, 5.0]) to exponentiate the validities: `v_eff = val ** kappa`. Then compute the evidence as `I_A = np.sum(v_eff * a) * (sum_a ** gamma)`. A `kappa > 1` will allow the highest-validity cue to naturally dominate the weaker cues, directly producing the non-compensatory shifts needed for Experiments 20, 27, and 28, while `gamma` handles the diminishing returns of accumulating multiple cues.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.3319 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.3262 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate using `kappa` to exponentiate validities (Iteration 5) was REJECTED by the gate, as its aggregate loss (0.3262) failed to beat the Iteration 2 base (0.3219). The loop has automatically reverted to the Iteration 2 base. While `kappa` was mathematically capable of capturing Take-The-Best-like behavior, combining it with the existing `gamma` tally-scaling likely caused parameter bloat and flattened the loss landscape, preventing the model from cleanly optimizing. However, the core problem remains: the Iteration 2 base fails to capture the strong non-compensatory reversals in Experiments 20, 27, and 28 (e.g., Exp 20 observed = 0.8700, base = 0.3483). We need a configural weighting mechanism that naturally allows a single high-validity cue to overpower multiple weak cues, without adding redundant parameters.
Rationale: To properly implement configural weighting that captures the Take-The-Best-like reversals without adding parameter bloat, replace the tally-based scaling (`sum_a ** gamma`) with a contrast-based configural weight. Specifically, scale each cue by its relative contribution to the option's total evidence: `w_a = val * (val / max(1e-6, np.sum(val * a))) ** gamma`. 

If `gamma > 0`, this mechanism enhances cues that dominate their option's evidence (e.g., a single strong cue retains its full weight) while heavily discounting cues that are just one of many (e.g., three weak cues will have their weights suppressed). This provides a highly stable, single-parameter knob to interpolate between purely compensatory accumulation (`gamma = 0`) and strong non-compensatory discounting (`gamma > 0`), directly addressing the failures in Exps 20, 27, and 28. Keep the LCA simulation, parameter ranges, and the rest of the Iteration 2 base exactly intact.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.3262 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3308 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate was REJECTED by the gate, as its aggregate loss (0.3308) failed to beat the Iteration 2 base (0.3219). The loop has automatically reverted to the Iteration 2 base. The attempt to use a contrast-based configural weighting (`val / sum(val * a)`) likely failed because it overly penalized options in experiments where human behavior is actually compensatory (e.g., Exp 9 and Exp 15). The Iteration 2 base, which uses a simpler tally-based scaling (`sum_a ** gamma`), remains the most empirically successful approach so far. However, it still struggles to capture the full magnitude of non-compensatory reversals in Exps 20, 27, and 28. The issue may not be the configural weighting formula itself, but rather how the total evidence is scaled before competing in the LCA.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Build exactly on the accepted Iteration 2 base, restoring its configural weighting: `w_a = val * (np.sum(a) ** gamma)` (ensure you add a small epsilon like `1e-6` to `np.sum(a)` to prevent NaN when gamma is negative). Instead of changing this weighting scheme further, introduce a non-linear transducer on the total evidence before it enters the LCA. Specifically, compute `I_A = np.sum(w_a * a) ** alpha` and `I_B = np.sum(w_b * b) ** alpha`, adding `alpha` as a new parameter in the range [0.1, 5.0]. This allows the model to non-linearly stretch or compress the initial evidence differences, amplifying the Take-The-Best winner before the leaky accumulation and inhibition phases, without disrupting the stability of the configural weights."
