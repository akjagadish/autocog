# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Propose a 'Mixture of Strategies' theory. The model should assume that the population consists of two distinct types of decision-makers: a proportion 'alpha' uses a simple Tallying heuristic (ignoring validities and just counting feature wins), while the remaining '1 - alpha' proportion uses a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy (weighting features by their objective validities). This mixture approach can naturally explain why the observed data frequently falls between the predictions of pure Tallying and pure WADD, and why different experimental designs pull the population average toward one extreme or the other.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Mixture of Strategies: The decision-making population consists of individuals who employ a mixture of two distinct strategies. A proportion of choices (governed by parameter 'alpha') is made using a simple non-compensatory Tallying heuristic, which completely ignores feature validities and simply counts the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other. The remaining proportion of choices ('1 - alpha') is made using a fully compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy, where features are weighted by their objective chance-centered validities. This mixture naturally interpolates between pure heuristic and fully compensatory behavior, explaining why aggregate human data frequently falls between the predictions of either pure strategy.

`parameters`:
- alpha: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta_tally: [0.1, 10.0]
- beta_wadd: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
This theory directly implements the arbiter's suggestion of a 'Mixture of Strategies' model. It proposes that decision-making in the population is driven by a blend of two fundamentally different mechanisms: a simple Tallying heuristic and a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. By mixing the probability distributions of these two strategies via the 'alpha' parameter, the model can capture both the threshold-like behavior of heuristics and the continuous trade-offs of compensatory models. Separate inverse temperature parameters (beta_tally and beta_wadd) are used to account for the different scales of the tallying scores (integers) and WADD scores (small fractions), ensuring both strategies can independently range from random to highly deterministic.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3558 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3558.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate successfully implements the requested Mixture of Strategies (Tallying + WADD) and was ACCEPTED by the gate, achieving a strong baseline fit. It performs very well on Experiments 2, 3, 7, and 9. However, it significantly misses the empirical targets in Experiments 1, 4, 5, and 6. In particular, the WADD component currently uses chance-centered validities (val - 0.5) as weights, which assumes a linear scaling of evidence. Human compensatory strategies often scale non-linearly with probability, weighting highly valid features much more strongly than moderately valid ones.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "While the mixture framework is working well, the WADD component's weighting scheme should be adjusted to improve fits on experiments where compensatory behavior dominates (like Exps 1, 4, 5, 6). Instead of simple chance-centered validities (val - 0.5), modify the WADD strategy to use Bayesian log-odds weights: `w = np.log(val / (1.0 - val))`. This normative transformation will naturally stretch the weights of highly valid features, allowing the WADD component to better capture strong preferences when validities are high, while keeping the prescribed mixture mechanism intact."
