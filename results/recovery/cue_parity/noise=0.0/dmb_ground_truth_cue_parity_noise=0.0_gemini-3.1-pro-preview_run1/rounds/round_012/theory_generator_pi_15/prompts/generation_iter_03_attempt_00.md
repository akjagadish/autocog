# generation_iter_03_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_14`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_14`).

Propose a 'Weighted Sequential Evidence Accumulation with Decay' (or Leaky Accumulator) theory. Instead of an unweighted running tally (like Theory 2) or a discrete mixture of strategies (like Theory 1), assume decision-makers evaluate features sequentially in order of validity. Each feature's difference is weighted by its validity, and added to a running accumulator. Crucially, previously accumulated evidence 'leaks' or decays as new features are evaluated. A choice is made either when the accumulator hits a boundary or when all features are exhausted. This allows for primacy effects (if decay is low and threshold is hit early, mimicking TTB) or compensatory effects with complex weighting, bridging the gap between the two current models and potentially explaining the extreme values in Exp 2, Exp 17, and Exp 24.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.488)

**Description**
Decision-makers use a Sequential Evidence Accumulation strategy with a stopping rule. They inspect features one by one in descending order of their validity, maintaining a running sum of the differences between the options. If the absolute accumulated evidence reaches or exceeds a specific threshold, they stop and make a choice based on that evidence. If the threshold is not reached, they evaluate all features and decide based on the final tally. This allows the model to smoothly transition between Take-The-Best (low threshold) and Tallying (high threshold) behaviors.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.352)

**Description**
People primarily compare multi-attribute options using a Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features on which each option is strictly better. The option with the higher tally is chosen. However, if the tallies are tied, the decision-maker falls back to a compensatory tie-breaking mechanism, evaluating the options based on the weighted sum of their features. The weights correspond to feature validities centered at chance and non-linearly scaled by a parameter gamma, allowing flexible adjustment of the tie-breaker's sensitivity to validity differences.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.4046 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.4795 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.4249 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4046 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Weighted Sequential Evidence Accumulation with Decay (Leaky Accumulator). Decision-makers process information sequentially in descending order of feature validity. Each feature's evidence (the difference between options) is weighted by its validity and added to a running accumulator. As new features are evaluated, previously accumulated evidence 'leaks' or decays. A choice is made either when the accumulator hits a predefined threshold (leading to primacy effects akin to Take-The-Best) or when all features are exhausted (allowing for compensatory behavior).

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    leak = float(parameters["leak"])
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Evaluate features in descending order of validity
    order = np.argsort(val)[::-1]
    
    A = 0.0
    for idx in order:
        diff = a[idx] - b[idx]
        weight = val[idx] ** gamma
        
        # Leaky accumulation
        A = A * (1.0 - leak) + weight * diff
        
        # Stopping rule
        if abs(A) >= threshold and abs(A) > 1e-9:
            break
            
    scores = np.array([A, -A])
    
    # Softmax conversion to probabilities
    z = beta * scores
    z -= np.max(z)  # For numerical stability
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- threshold: [0.0, 5.0]
- leak: [0.0, 1.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 5.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's suggestion, this model implements a Leaky Accumulator where evidence is gathered sequentially based on feature validity. The 'leak' parameter allows earlier evidence to decay, while the 'threshold' parameter controls whether the decision stops early (Primacy/TTB) or evaluates all features (Compensatory). The 'gamma' parameter allows non-linear scaling of the validities to adjust how much weight each feature carries. This single unified mechanism naturally bridges the gap between Take-The-Best and Tallying/WADD without relying on an arbitrary discrete mixture.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Leaky Accumulator theory was ACCEPTED by the gate, achieving a new best aggregate loss. It matches several experiments reasonably well (e.g., Exp 2, 8, 9). However, it severely mispredicts experiments designed to test primacy vs. recency and complex compensatory weighting, such as Exp 13, 15, 18, 22, and 26. The core issue lies in how 'leak' is implemented: a standard leak (decaying the running tally) produces a *recency* effect if the boundary is not hit, because earlier evidence decays away. Human decision-makers in these tasks often show strong *primacy* effects (weighting the most valid features heavily regardless of stopping).
Rationale: To maintain the prescribed sequential evidence accumulation family while fixing the primacy/recency balance, replace or supplement the accumulator 'leak' with an 'attention_decay' parameter. Instead of decaying the running total `A`, decay the incoming weight of features as you move down the sequence (e.g., `weight = (val[idx] ** gamma) * (attention_decay ** step)`). This naturally captures primacy (if attention drops off) or recency/tallying (if attention is stable) even when the decision threshold isn't reached, likely fixing the severe misses on Exp 18, 22, and 26 without breaking the accepted base.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4046 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.4795 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The attention decay mechanism was REJECTED by the gate, as it severely degraded performance on Experiments 2, 4, and 12 compared to the base model. While it was an attempt to fix primacy effects in Exps 18, 22, and 26, it deviated too far from the arbiter's prescribed leaky accumulator and failed to generalize.
Rationale: We must return to the arbiter's exact mechanism: a true Leaky Accumulator where the *previously accumulated evidence* decays (`A = A * leak + weight * diff`). To capture the strong primacy effects needed for Exps 18, 22, and 26 without breaking the rest of the benchmark, rely on early stopping and extreme validity weighting rather than attention decay. Implement the standard leak, but expand the range of the `gamma` parameter (e.g., `[0.0, 10.0]`) so that the model can learn to heavily overweight the most valid features, and ensure the `threshold` range allows for very early stopping.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.4795 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.4249 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate (Iteration 3) was REJECTED by the gate, as its loss of 0.4249 is worse than the running-best base from Iteration 1 (0.4046). While expanding the `gamma` range to [0.0, 10.0] was intended to help the model hit the threshold early and produce primacy effects, it actually degraded the overall fit across the benchmark (e.g., worsening fits on Exp 2, 4, 12, and 13 compared to the base). The combination of a very high gamma, standard leak, and the current stopping rule (`abs(A) >= threshold and abs(A) > 1e-9`) seems to make the model's behavior too brittle, oscillating between extreme recency (if threshold is missed) and extreme primacy.
Rationale: Since expanding gamma to 10.0 failed, we need to revert to a tighter `gamma` range (e.g., [0.0, 5.0]) to stabilize the weighting. Furthermore, the stopping rule `if abs(A) >= threshold and abs(A) > 1e-9` might be artificially preventing early stopping when the accumulated evidence is exactly equal to a small threshold (or when weights are small). Remove the `abs(A) > 1e-9` condition to allow genuine early stopping whenever the threshold is met, even if it's 0.0 (which would perfectly mimic Take-The-Best). Keep the prescribed Leaky Accumulator mechanism exactly as is, but adjust the parameter ranges to: threshold [0.0, 5.0], leak [0.0, 1.0], gamma [0.0, 5.0], beta [0.1, 10.0], and epsilon [0.0, 0.5].

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.4249 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
