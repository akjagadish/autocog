# Round 15 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_16` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Decision-makers use a Normalized Weighted Sequential Evidence Accumulation strategy with a stopping rule. They inspect features one by one in descending order of their validity. They accumulate the differences between the options weighted by the features' validities, which are non-linearly scaled and normalized to sum to 1. This normalization ensures the evidence scale is consistent across experiments with varying numbers of features. If the absolute accumulated evidence reaches or exceeds a specific threshold (bounded between 0 and 1), they stop and make a choice based on that evidence. If the threshold is not reached, they evaluate all features and decide based on the final tally.

**Rationale:** Applying the minimal-diff edit suggested by the critic: replacing the zero-centered validity weighting with a raw validity power-law weighting that is normalized to sum to 1. This bounds the maximum possible accumulated evidence regardless of the number of features or their raw validity values. The threshold parameter range is updated to [0.0, 1.0] to match this normalized scale, ensuring the stopping rule triggers consistently across different experimental designs.

**Parameters:**
  - `threshold`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 5.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

### slot 2 — `pi_17` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Strategy Selection based on Environment Classification

**Rationale:** Addressing the critic's feedback, the previous model's fixed attention parameter (gamma) forced a compromise that failed to capture extreme compensatory or non-compensatory behavior across different environments. This update implements the 'Strategy Selection' theory explicitly suggested by the arbiter. The model classifies the decision environment by calculating the dispersion (standard deviation) of the feature validities. A soft gating function (controlled by `dispersion_threshold` and `slope`) then determines the probability of using Take-The-Best versus Tallying. This allows the model to dynamically shift its entire decision strategy based on the structure of the environment, successfully predicting divergent behavior across different experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `dispersion_threshold`: `[0.0, 0.3]`
  - `slope`: `[1.0, 100.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Environment classification based on validity dispersion
    dispersion = np.std(val)
    threshold = float(parameters["dispersion_threshold"])
    slope = float(parameters["slope"])
    
    # Probability of selecting Take-The-Best over Tallying
    w_ttb = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-slope * (dispersion - threshold)))
    
    # Take-The-Best (TTB) prediction
    order = np.argsort(val)[::-1]
    diff = a - b
    ttb_a, ttb_b = 0.0, 0.0

        elif diff[idx] < 0:
            ttb_b = 1.0

    p_tally /= np.sum(p_tally)
    
    # Mixture of strategies
    p_core = w_ttb * p_ttb + (1.0 - w_ttb) * p_tally
    
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])

## Replacement

### `pi_18` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Parallel Similarity and Feature-Difference Model: Decision-makers evaluate options in parallel by computing a similarity-weighted score. Instead of a discrete stopping rule, the strategy smoothly transitions between Tallying (equal weighting) and a heavily weighted linear model (WADD) based on the overall similarity of the options. A Jaccard-like similarity metric is used. To ensure stability, the feature weights for both strategies are normalized to sum to 1.0, and the softmax temperature parameter is expanded to accommodate the normalized scale, allowing for highly deterministic choice behavior.

**Rationale:** To address the critic's feedback, we have modified the base (Iteration 2) by explicitly normalizing the Tallying and WADD weight vectors to sum to 1.0 before interpolating between them. This prevents the score variance from artificially shifting due to scale differences between the strategies. To compensate for the resulting compression of the score scale, the upper bound of the `beta` parameter has been expanded from 10.0 to 50.0, restoring the model's ability to fit highly deterministic human choice patterns.

**Parameters:**
  - `sim_threshold`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `slope`: `[-50.0, 50.0]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
