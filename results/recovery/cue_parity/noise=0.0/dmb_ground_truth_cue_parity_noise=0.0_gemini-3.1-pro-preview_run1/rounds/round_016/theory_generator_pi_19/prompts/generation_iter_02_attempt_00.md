# generation_iter_02_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_18`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_17`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_17`).

Propose a brand-new theory that relies on an evidence accumulation framework (e.g., a discrete Sequential Sampling or Decision Field Theory model) or a trial-level difficulty/conflict metric. Instead of switching strategies based on overall environment dispersion or simple feature overlap, the new theory should evaluate the strength of evidence for each option dynamically. For example, if the most valid features provide highly conflicting evidence, the decision process might naturally integrate more features (mimicking a shift towards WADD or Tallying), whereas decisive early evidence leads to a TTB-like quick termination. This approach can explain both the sensitivity to feature differences in Exp 1 and the stability in Exp 2 without relying on rigid heuristic mixtures.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.371)

**Description**
People primarily compare multi-attribute options using a Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features on which each option is strictly better. The option with the higher tally is chosen. However, if the tallies are tied, the decision-maker falls back to a compensatory tie-breaking mechanism, evaluating the options based on the weighted sum of their features. The weights correspond to feature validities centered at chance and non-linearly scaled by a parameter gamma, allowing flexible adjustment of the tie-breaker's sensitivity to validity differences.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.356)

**Description**
Decision-makers use a Sequential Evidence Accumulation strategy with a stopping rule. They inspect features one by one in descending order of their validity, maintaining a running sum of the differences between the options. If the absolute accumulated evidence reaches or exceeds a specific threshold, they stop and make a choice based on that evidence. If the threshold is not reached, they evaluate all features and decide based on the final tally. This allows the model to smoothly transition between Take-The-Best (low threshold) and Tallying (high threshold) behaviors.

def predict(parameters, state, history):

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.3651 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.4337 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3651 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Decision-makers use a dynamic sequential evidence accumulation process. They evaluate features in decreasing order of validity, maintaining a running sum of the validity-weighted differences between options. After each feature, they compare the accumulated evidence to the maximum possible evidence that could be provided by all remaining unobserved features. If the current evidence exceeds a threshold fraction of the remaining possible evidence, they stop and make a choice. This dynamically adapts the amount of information processed: highly conflicting early evidence keeps the accumulated difference small, prompting the integration of more features (similar to WADD or Tallying), whereas decisive early evidence leads to quick termination (similar to Take-The-Best).

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Order features by validity descending
    order = np.argsort(val)[::-1]
    
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    e = 0.0
    for i, idx in enumerate(order):
        e += val[idx] * (a[idx] - b[idx])
        
        # Maximum possible evidence from remaining features
        if i + 1 < len(order):
            max_rem = np.sum(val[order[i+1:]])
        else:
            max_rem = 0.0
            
        # Dynamic stopping rule based on remaining possible evidence
        if abs(e) >= threshold * max_rem and abs(e) > 0:
            break
            
    scores = np.array([e, -e])
    
    z = beta * scores
    z -= np.max(z)
    p_core = np.exp(z) / np.sum(np.exp(z))
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- threshold: [0.0, 3.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: The arbiter requested a dynamic evidence accumulation framework that avoids rigid heuristic mixtures and instead stops based on the strength of evidence relative to conflict. This model implements a sequential sampling process where features are inspected in order of validity. At each step, the accumulated validity-weighted difference is compared to the maximum possible evidence the remaining features could provide. A threshold parameter scales this stopping rule: a low threshold mimics Take-The-Best by stopping at the first discriminating feature, while a high threshold requires more evidence, naturally shifting the process toward WADD when early features conflict. This provides a smooth, trial-by-trial adaptation to difficulty without relying on global environment statistics.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory successfully implemented the arbiter's prescribed dynamic sequential evidence accumulation model, and it was ACCEPTED by the gate, establishing a new running-best loss. The mechanism of comparing accumulated evidence `e` to `threshold * max_rem` provides an elegant continuum between Take-The-Best (early stopping) and WADD (exhaustive integration). However, there are still significant misfits, such as Experiment 13 (Obs=0.2611, Cand=1.1305) and Experiment 5 (Obs=0.3850, Cand=0.8271). This suggests that while the mechanism family is correct, the parameterization and scaling of the stopping rule or the choice temperature need refinement.
Rationale: Keep the prescribed mechanism family exactly as is (sequential evaluation by validity, accumulating validity-weighted differences, stopping when `abs(e) >= threshold * max_rem`). However, make minor adjustments to improve fit: 1) The `threshold` parameter range [0.0, 3.0] is largely redundant above 1.0, because `abs(e)` can rarely exceed `1.0 * max_rem` unless `max_rem` is 0. Constrain the `threshold` range to [0.0, 1.0] or [0.0, 1.5] to focus the optimizer on the meaningful transition space. 2) Increase the upper bound of `beta` (e.g., to 50.0) so that when the model stops early with a small accumulated evidence `e`, it can still produce highly deterministic choices if needed. 3) Ensure that when `max_rem == 0`, the loop always terminates cleanly (which it currently does, but verify it doesn't cause zero-division if you ever change the condition).

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3651 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.4337 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The previous attempt to constrain the threshold and increase beta was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the modifications worsened the fit compared to iteration 1. A likely structural flaw in the current model is the dynamic stopping rule `abs(e) >= threshold * max_rem`. Because `max_rem` decreases as features are evaluated, encountering a tied feature (where `a[idx] == b[idx]`) leaves `e` unchanged but drops `max_rem`. This can artificially trigger early stopping simply because a tied feature was observed, which misaligns with human evidence accumulation. A more standard and robust mechanism is needed to fulfill the arbiter's recommendation.
Rationale: Return to the iteration 1 base but modify the stopping rule. Instead of scaling the threshold by `max_rem`, use a fixed absolute evidence threshold: stop integrating features when `abs(e) >= threshold`. This perfectly captures the arbiter's prescribed dynamic: if early features conflict, `e` stays near 0, forcing the model to integrate more features (mimicking WADD/Tallying). If early features are decisive, `e` grows quickly and hits the threshold, stopping early (mimicking TTB). Set the `threshold` parameter range to something wide enough to cover the maximum possible sum of validities (e.g., [0.0, 5.0]) so the model can learn to either stop at the first feature or integrate all of them. Keep `beta` at its iteration 1 range [0.1, 10.0] since the higher range was rejected.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.4337 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
