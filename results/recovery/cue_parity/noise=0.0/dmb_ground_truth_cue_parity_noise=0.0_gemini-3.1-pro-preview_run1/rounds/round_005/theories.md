# Round 5 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_6` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People use a single-stage Additive Utility evaluation where features are weighted by a power-law transformation of their chance-centered objective validities. By avoiding artificial weight normalization and allowing for sufficiently high softmax temperatures and power parameters, the decision-making process can smoothly and stably interpolate between Tallying (equal weights), proportional weighting, and highly deterministic Take-The-Best behavior (where the most valid cues dominate completely).

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we build directly on the successful Iteration 2 base. The chance-centered power law `weights = (val - 0.5 + 1e-6) ** gamma` is retained without normalization, as normalizing artificially compressed the scores and caused the softmax to become too soft in Iteration 5. To allow the model to make sharper, more deterministic choices when necessary (such as in TTB-dominant experiments like Exp 4), we significantly expand the `beta` range to `[0.1, 50.0]` and the `gamma` range to `[0.0, 10.0]`. This gives the optimizer the freedom to scale the scores naturally and find the strict non-compensatory regimes without hitting artificial numerical ceilings.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Transform validities using a simple power law on chance-centered values
    # gamma=0 -> Tallying, gamma=1 -> WADD, gamma>1 -> TTB
    centered_val = val - 0.5
    weights = (centered_val + 1e-6) ** gamma
    
    scores = np.array([np.sum(a * weights), np.sum(b * weights)])

    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

```


### slot 2 — `pi_7` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Mixture of Strategies with Bayesian Weights: The decision-making population consists of individuals who employ a mixture of two distinct strategies. A proportion of choices (governed by parameter 'alpha') is made using a simple non-compensatory Tallying heuristic, which completely ignores feature validities and simply counts the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other. The remaining proportion of choices ('1 - alpha') is made using a fully compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy, where features are weighted by their Bayesian log-odds (log(v / (1-v))). This non-linear transformation naturally stretches the weights of highly valid features, allowing the model to capture strong compensatory preferences while interpolating with pure heuristic behavior.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the WADD component has been modified to use Bayesian log-odds weights (`np.log(val / (1.0 - val))`) instead of linear chance-centered validities. This normative transformation naturally scales evidence non-linearly, disproportionately up-weighting highly predictive features. This minimal edit addresses the underperformance in experiments where compensatory behavior strongly relies on high-validity cues (Exps 1, 4, 5, 6) while preserving the successful mixture framework that captures the interpolation between heuristic and compensatory strategies.

**Parameters:**
  - `alpha`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta_tally`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `beta_wadd`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

## Replacement

### `pi_8` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Rank-Based Weighting with Normalized Power-Law Decay: Decision makers rank features by their objective validities and assign decision weights based on their ordinal rank. By applying a power-law transformation on the ranks (e.g., w_i = rank_i ^ -gamma) and explicitly normalizing these weights to sum to 1, the model ensures that the total accumulated evidence remains bounded on a consistent scale regardless of the steepness parameter gamma. This allows a single temperature parameter to stably govern choice determinism across both strictly compensatory (Tallying) and non-compensatory (Take-The-Best) strategies.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we revert to the power-law rank weighting from the accepted Iteration 1 base but introduce explicit weight normalization. By normalizing the weights to sum to 1.0 before computing the dot product, the resulting option scores are bounded. This solves the scaling issue where varying gamma drastically changed the absolute magnitude of the scores, which previously prevented a single beta parameter from controlling choice determinism consistently across Tallying and Take-The-Best regimes. The beta range is also expanded to 100.0 to allow for deterministic choices on this normalized scale.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 100.0]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
