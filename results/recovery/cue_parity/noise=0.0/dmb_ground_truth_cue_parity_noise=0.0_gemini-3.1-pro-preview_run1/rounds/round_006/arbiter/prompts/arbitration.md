# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_6" and "pi_8") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_8" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_6
People use a single-stage Additive Utility evaluation where features are weighted by a power-law transformation of their chance-centered objective validities. By avoiding artificial weight normalization and allowing for sufficiently high softmax temperatures and power parameters, the decision-making process can smoothly and stably interpolate between Tallying (equal weights), proportional weighting, and highly deterministic Take-The-Best behavior (where the most valid cues dominate completely).

## THEORY 2 — pi_8
Rank-Based Weighting with Normalized Power-Law Decay: Decision makers rank features by their objective validities and assign decision weights based on their ordinal rank. By applying a power-law transformation on the ranks (e.g., w_i = rank_i ^ -gamma) and explicitly normalizing these weights to sum to 1, the model ensures that the total accumulated evidence remains bounded on a consistent scale regardless of the steepness parameter gamma. This allows a single temperature parameter to stably govern choice determinism across both strictly compensatory (Tallying) and non-compensatory (Take-The-Best) strategies.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_6)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.93, 0.91, 0.6, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Additive Utility with chance-centered validity weighting) from the Competing Theory (Rank-Based Weighting), we exploit the difference between magnitude-based and ordinal-based feature evaluation. The Advocated Theory scales weights based on the absolute magnitude of the validities, meaning that features with very similar validities will receive almost identical weights. In contrast, the Competing Theory relies strictly on ordinal ranks, enforcing a fixed drop-off in weight between rank 1, 2, and 3, regardless of how close their actual validities are. By using a set of validities with a tight cluster at the top (e.g., 0.95, 0.93, 0.91) and a drop-off to lower validities (0.60, 0.55), we construct trials where the sum of the 2nd and 3rd best features easily outweighs the 1st best feature in the Advocated Theory (because 0.93 and 0.91 are almost as good as 0.95), but fails to do so in the Competing Theory (because rank 2 and 3 are heavily penalized compared to rank 1). Conversely, we create trials where multiple low-rank features can outweigh a single higher-rank feature in the Competing Theory, but fail to do so in the Advocated Theory due to the massive gap in objective validity.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes the overall proportion of times subjects choose the option with features 2 and 3 (the '01100' option) in Trials 1 and 3. Under the Advocated Theory, validities 0.93 and 0.91 are almost as strong as 0.95, so their combined weight easily outweighs feature 1 (0.95) in Trial 1, and also outweighs features 1, 4, 5 (0.95, 0.60, 0.55) in Trial 3. Thus, the Advocated Theory consistently prefers the '01100' option in both trials, leading to a metric value near 2.0. In contrast, the Competing Theory enforces a strict ordinal drop-off, heavily penalizing ranks 2 and 3. As a result, feature 1 dominates features 2 and 3 in Trial 1, and features 1, 4, 5 dominate features 2 and 3 in Trial 3. The Competing Theory therefore avoids the '01100' option in both trials, yielding a metric value near 0.0.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_8)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.6, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the Advocated Theory (Rank-Based Weighting) from the Competing Theory (Magnitude-Based Additive Utility) by exploiting the difference between ordinal ranks and absolute validities. The validities are chosen to have a tight cluster of high values (0.95, 0.90, 0.85) and a drop-off to lower values (0.60, 0.55). Because the Advocated Theory relies strictly on ordinal rank, it enforces a fixed, steep drop-off between Rank 1, 2, and 3 regardless of their numerical proximity. Consequently, it predicts that Rank 1 will robustly outweigh Ranks 2 and 3 combined. Conversely, the Competing Theory scales weights by the magnitude of chance-centered validities, meaning Ranks 1, 2, and 3 will receive very similar weights. Thus, the Competing Theory predicts that Ranks 2 and 3 combined will easily overpower Rank 1. By systematically pitting the single best feature against multiple slightly-less-valid features, we create a sharp double dissociation between rank-based and magnitude-based weighting.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design pits the single best feature (Rank 1, validity 0.95) against a combination of slightly less valid features (Ranks 2 and 3, validities 0.90 and 0.85). The Advocated Theory (Rank-Based Weighting) enforces a steep drop-off between Rank 1 and Ranks 2/3, predicting that the option with Feature 1 will be chosen more frequently. In contrast, the Competing Theory (Magnitude-Based Additive Utility) scales weights by chance-centered validities (0.45 vs 0.40 and 0.35), meaning Ranks 2 and 3 combined (0.75) will easily overpower Rank 1 (0.45), leading to fewer choices for the option with Feature 1. This metric simply calculates the overall proportion of trials where the subject chooses the option containing Feature 1, which will robustly discriminate between the two theories.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the 14 experiments, neither Theory 1 (Magnitude-Based Additive Utility) nor Theory 2 (Rank-Based Weighting) consistently captures the observed data. Theory 1 dramatically fails in Experiment 1 (predicting 1.18 vs observed 0.26) and struggles with Experiments 4, 6, and 7. Theory 2 performs well on Experiment 1 and 13, but completely fails on Experiments 2, 4, 6, 7, and 14. The observed data frequently falls somewhere between the extremes predicted by strict ordinal rank-based weighting and magnitude-based weighting. The consistent failure of both pure weighting schemes to capture the nuance in experiments pitting one high-validity feature against multiple lower-validity features suggests that human decision-making in this task may not be a single static weighting rule. Instead, people might be using a mixture of strategies (e.g., some subjects use Tallying, others use Take-The-Best) or a sequential evidence accumulation process where they stop evaluating features once a certain threshold of evidence is reached.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a brand-new theory based on a Mixture of Strategies or a Sequential Evidence Accumulation with a stopping rule. For example, a theory where a decision-maker samples features in order of their validity and stops to make a choice once the accumulated difference in evidence between the two options exceeds a certain threshold. Alternatively, a population-level mixture model where a parameter dictates the proportion of the population using a non-compensatory strategy (like Take-The-Best) versus a compensatory one (like Tallying). This flexibility should better capture the intermediate observed values that neither pure magnitude nor pure rank-based additive models can explain."
