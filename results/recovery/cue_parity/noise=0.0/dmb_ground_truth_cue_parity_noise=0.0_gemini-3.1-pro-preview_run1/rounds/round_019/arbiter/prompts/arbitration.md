# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_20" and "pi_21") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_20" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_21" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 2 — pi_21
Decision-makers evaluate options using a Leaky Competing Accumulator (LCA) process, where attention shifts sequentially across features in order of their validity. Evidence for each option accumulates continuously over time, subject to information decay (leakage) and lateral inhibition. When lateral inhibition is strong, early evidence from highly valid features quickly suppresses the competing option, locking in a choice and producing non-compensatory 'Take-The-Best' behavior. Conversely, when leakage and inhibition are low, evidence from all features integrates more evenly without suppression, resulting in compensatory 'Tallying' or WADD-like behavior. This provides a unified mechanistic account for the spectrum of decision strategies without requiring explicit rule-switching.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_20)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Non-linear Feature Difference Model with Flexible Validity Centering) from the Competing Theory (Leaky Competing Accumulator), we exploit the Advocated Theory's 'theta' parameter, which allows for flexible centering of validities. In the Competing Theory, validities are strictly centered at 0.5, meaning any feature with a validity > 0.5 always provides positive evidence for the option that wins it. Consequently, if Option A dominates Option B on low-validity features, the Competing Theory structurally must accumulate positive evidence for A. In contrast, the Advocated Theory subtracts 'theta' from the validities. If 'theta' is higher than the validity of a feature, winning that feature yields a NEGATIVE weight, actively penalizing the option. By constructing trials where Option A wins on the highest validity feature AND multiple low-validity features, while Option B wins only on the second-highest validity feature, the Competing Theory predicts a robust preference for A (due to early accumulation from F1 and support from F3-F5). However, the Advocated Theory can predict a strong preference for B, as the 'wins' on the low-validity features heavily penalize Option A.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The Competing Theory (LCA) scales validities by `(val - 0.5)^gamma`. Because all validities in this design are relatively close to 0.5, when the parameter `gamma` is greater than 1 (which occurs 80% of the time given its uniform distribution over [0.1, 5.0]), the evidence values are squashed to near zero. This leads to a lack of evidence accumulation, resulting in choices driven primarily by noise, yielding choice probabilities close to 0.5 for almost all trials. Thus, the mean absolute deviation of choice proportions from 0.5 will be low (approaching the expectation for random guessing). In contrast, the Advocated Theory computes net evidence using `val - theta`. For most values of `theta`, the net evidence for any given trial is substantially non-zero. Combined with the non-linear value function and softmax, this produces highly deterministic choice probabilities (close to 0 or 1). Therefore, the mean absolute deviation of choice proportions from 0.5 will be significantly higher in the Advocated Theory. By averaging this absolute deviation across all trials, we obtain a robust measure of 'choice determinism' that cleanly discriminates the theories with minimal between-subject variance.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_21)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.65, 0.55, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Leaky Competing Accumulator) from the Competing Theory (Non-linear Feature Difference Model with Flexible Validity Centering), we exploit the fundamental difference in how they center validities. The Advocated Theory hardcodes centering at 0.5, meaning any feature with validity > 0.5 always provides positive evidence for the option that wins it. Furthermore, it evaluates features sequentially with lateral inhibition, allowing early high-validity features to lock in a choice. In contrast, the Competing Theory centers validities by a flexible parameter 'theta'. If 'theta' is high, lower-validity features receive a negative weight, actively penalizing the option that wins them. By constructing trials where Option A wins the highest-validity feature AND multiple low-validity features (e.g., F1, F4, F5) while Option B wins the intermediate features (F2, F3), the Advocated Theory predicts a robust preference for Option A due to the early F1 lead and the guaranteed positive contribution of F4 and F5. However, the Competing Theory can predict a strong preference for Option B, because a high 'theta' turns A's wins on F4 and F5 into penalties, overriding F1's advantage.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Measures the difference in preference for Option A between Trial 4 (A=[1,1,0,0,0]) and Trial 3 (A=[0,1,1,1,1]). In the Advocated Theory (LCA), Option A in Trial 4 wins the two most valid features (F1, F2), giving it a massive early accumulation advantage that suppresses B, leading to a very high P(A). In Trial 3, B wins F1, gaining the early advantage, which drastically reduces P(A). This creates a huge positive difference. In the Competing Theory, the net evidence for A in Trial 4 is 0.05 + theta, while in Trial 3 it is 1.65 - 3*theta. The difference is highly sensitive to the flexible centering parameter theta, but generally produces a much smaller or even negative contrast compared to the extreme non-compensatory shift predicted by LCA.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the 40 experiments, both theories struggle to consistently capture the observed data. THEORY 1 (pi_20, Non-linear Feature Difference with Flexible Centering) captures some variance in Experiment 1 and 10, but fails drastically in Experiments 2, 7, 8, 15, and 22. Its flexible centering parameter 'theta' often leads to over-penalization of options that win low-validity features, resulting in predictions that are completely reversed from the observed data (e.g., Exp 22). THEORY 2 (pi_21, LCA) performs well on Experiment 2 and 9 but also completely misses the mark on several experiments like 22, 24, and 15, often predicting near-chance behavior where human subjects show strong deterministic preferences. Given the significant failures of both models to capture the diverse range of compensatory and non-compensatory behaviors, a completely new theoretical framework is needed.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a new theory based on a 'Probabilistic Strategy Selection' or 'Heuristic Toolbox' framework. Instead of a single mechanism (like LCA or a non-linear value function), decision-makers might probabilistically sample from a set of distinct decision rules (e.g., Take-The-Best, Tallying, and Weighted Additive) on a trial-by-trial basis, depending on the specific dispersion of validities and the difficulty of the trial. The model should include parameters for the base rates of each strategy and a noise/lapse rate. This would allow it to flexibly capture both strongly non-compensatory choices (when Take-The-Best is selected) and compensatory choices (when Tallying or WADD is selected) without forcing a single mechanistic compromise."
