# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_13" and "pi_9") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_13" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_9" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_13
Decision-makers use a purely compensatory Weighted Additive Strategy (WADD). Instead of applying early stopping or lexicographic rules, individuals evaluate all available features for both options. Each feature is weighted by a non-linear transformation of its objective validity, capturing varying sensitivities to evidence strength. The overall subjective value of an option is the sum of its weighted features, and choices are made probabilistically based on the difference in these overall values. By allowing for very large scaling parameters, the model can approximate non-compensatory behavior within a purely compensatory framework.

## THEORY 2 — pi_9
Decision-makers use a Sequential Evidence Accumulation strategy with a stopping rule. They inspect features one by one in descending order of their validity, maintaining a running sum of the differences between the options. If the absolute accumulated evidence reaches or exceeds a specific threshold, they stop and make a choice based on that evidence. If the threshold is not reached, they evaluate all features and decide based on the final tally. This allows the model to smoothly transition between Take-The-Best (low threshold) and Tallying (high threshold) behaviors.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_13)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.94, 0.93, 0.6, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Weighted Additive Strategy, WADD) from the Competing Theory (Sequential Evidence Accumulation), we exploit the difference between magnitude-based weighting and unweighted sequential tallying. By using a tight cluster of high validities (0.95, 0.94, 0.93) and a drop-off to lower validities (0.60, 0.55), we can construct trials where the unweighted running tally of the Competing Theory fluctuates but structurally forces it to predict one option regardless of its threshold, whereas the Advocated Theory's weighted sum overcomes the early deficit and predicts the opposite option. For example, in a trial where Option B wins on the 1st, 4th, and 5th features, and Option A wins on the 2nd and 3rd, the Competing Theory's unweighted tally starts at -1 (favoring B), goes to 0, +1, 0, and ends at -1, meaning it will choose B whether it stops early (threshold <= 1) or tallies to the end. In contrast, the Advocated Theory heavily weights the 2nd and 3rd features, allowing their combined magnitude to robustly overpower the 1st feature, predicting a strict preference for A across a wide range of its gamma parameter.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times subjects choose the option with ratings [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] over [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] (Trial 1). The Competing Theory (Sequential Evidence Accumulation) evaluates features in descending order of validity: V1(0.95), V2(0.94), V3(0.93), V4(0.60), V5(0.55). For these two options, the running difference for [1,0,0,1,1] starts at +1 (V1), goes to 0 (V2), -1 (V3), 0 (V4), and ends at +1 (V5). Because it never reaches a difference of 2, any threshold will either stop at V1 or evaluate all features and end at V5, structurally forcing the Competing Theory to always favor [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. In contrast, the Advocated Theory (Weighted Additive Strategy) heavily weights the clustered high validities (V2 + V3), easily overpowering V1 + V4 + V5. Therefore, the Advocated Theory robustly predicts a preference for [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], producing a large and stable gap between the two theories.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_9)

### DESIGN

  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Sequential Evidence Accumulation) from the Competing Theory (Weighted Additive Strategy), we exploit the difference between unweighted sequential accumulation and magnitude-weighted compensatory evaluation. By using a tight cluster of high validities (0.95, 0.94, 0.93) and a drop-off (0.60, 0.55), we can construct trials where the unweighted running tally of the Advocated Theory fluctuates but structurally forces it to predict one option regardless of its threshold, whereas the Competing Theory's weighted sum overcomes the early deficit and predicts the opposite option. For example, when Option B wins on the 1st, 4th, and 5th features, and Option A wins on the 2nd and 3rd, the Advocated Theory's unweighted tally starts at -1 (favoring B), goes to 0, +1, 0, and ends at -1, meaning it will choose B whether it stops early or tallies to the end. In contrast, the Competing Theory heavily weights the 2nd and 3rd features, allowing their combined magnitude to robustly overpower the 1st feature, predicting a strict preference for A across a wide range of its scaling parameter.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates the specific trial where the Advocated Theory (Sequential Evidence Accumulation) and the Competing Theory (Weighted Additive Strategy) are structurally forced to make opposite predictions for the vast majority of their parameter spaces. On this trial, the unweighted sequential tally fluctuates but ultimately favors Option B, whether the decision-maker stops early at the first feature or tallies all the way to the end. In contrast, the Competing Theory's compensatory evaluation heavily weights the second and third features, allowing their combined magnitude to robustly overpower the first feature and predict a strict preference for Option A. By calculating the choice probability of Option A on this trial, we expect the Advocated Theory to yield a value close to 0 (mostly choosing B), while the Competing Theory yields a significantly higher value.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across Experiments 1 and 2, the observed data strongly aligns with Theory 2 (Sequential Evidence Accumulation, pi_9), which predicts choice proportions around 0.15, whereas Theory 1 (Weighted Additive, pi_13) predicts ~0.53-0.55. This indicates that subjects are exhibiting strongly non-compensatory or threshold-based stopping behaviors rather than integrating all weighted features. However, looking at the broader suite of experiments (e.g., Exps 6, 23, 24), both theories struggle to capture the full variance of the data. Theory 1's purely compensatory approach is fundamentally misaligned with the thresholding behavior seen in Exps 1/2, while Theory 2's deterministic sequential logic misses subtler compensatory or tie-breaking effects in other experiments. Since Theory 1 completely fails to account for the lexicographic/thresholding behavior demonstrated in the latest experiments, it should be replaced.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Strategy Mixture' or 'Adaptive Toolbox' theory. Instead of assuming a single fixed strategy (either purely compensatory or purely sequential), this theory should posit that decision-makers possess a repertoire of strategies (e.g., Take-The-Best and Tallying/WADD) and probabilistically apply them. The probability of selecting a strategy could be a free parameter or depend on the cognitive conflict/dispersion of the validities. This would allow the model to seamlessly blend the strong non-compensatory choices observed in Exps 1 and 2 with the compensatory behaviors observed in other experiments, capturing the population-level heterogeneity that single-strategy models miss."
