# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_13`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_13`).

Propose a 'Strategy Mixture' or 'Adaptive Toolbox' theory. Instead of assuming a single fixed strategy (either purely compensatory or purely sequential), this theory should posit that decision-makers possess a repertoire of strategies (e.g., Take-The-Best and Tallying/WADD) and probabilistically apply them. The probability of selecting a strategy could be a free parameter or depend on the cognitive conflict/dispersion of the validities. This would allow the model to seamlessly blend the strong non-compensatory choices observed in Exps 1 and 2 with the compensatory behaviors observed in other experiments, capturing the population-level heterogeneity that single-strategy models miss.

- disp_threshold: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.0, 10.0]
- alpha: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the latest feedback, I reverted the environment dispersion metric to the standard deviation of validities, which proved more successful in Iteration 2. To address the persistent misfits in compensatory-heavy experiments (e.g., Exps 2, 4, 20), I explicitly formulated the compensatory strategy as a blend between purely equal-weighted Tallying and the validity-weighted WADD strategy, controlled by a new parameter `alpha`. This ensures the model can seamlessly collapse to pure Tallying in low-dispersion environments, which better captures human baseline compensatory behavior. I also reduced the maximum value of the steepness parameter `theta` to encourage a softer activation function for the strategy selection probability, preventing it from behaving as a strict step function.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4340 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.4154 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.4433 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4022 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.4022.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Strategy Mixture model successfully combines TTB and WADD, earning an acceptance from the gate with an improved aggregate loss (0.4340). However, it still exhibits severe misfits on several experiments where compensatory or tallying behaviors strongly dominate (e.g., Exps 2, 4, 5) versus experiments where non-compensatory choices prevail. The current limitation stems from using a single, fixed free parameter `p_ttb` across all environments. Since different experiments employ different validity structures, a fixed probability cannot capture the environment-driven shifts in strategy adoption.
Rationale: While the candidate correctly implemented the prescribed Strategy Mixture family, it missed the arbiter's suggestion to make the strategy selection probability depend on the environment. I recommend modifying the model so that `p_ttb` is not a raw free parameter, but rather a function of the dispersion or conflict in the `validities` vector (e.g., a logistic function of the variance of the validities, or the gap between the highest validity and the average of the rest, governed by new sensitivity parameters). This will allow the model to dynamically deploy TTB when validities are highly skewed and WADD/Tallying when validities are relatively flat, resolving the tension between Exp 1/14 and Exp 2/4/5 without leaving the mechanism family.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4340 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.4154 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model successfully implemented the dynamic strategy selection based on environment dispersion, leading to a reduction in aggregate loss (0.4154) and acceptance by the gate. However, the model still heavily underpredicts compensatory behaviors in several key experiments, notably Experiments 2, 4, and 20, where the deviations from human data remain substantial. The use of the standard deviation of validities as the sole driver for the probability of selecting Take-The-Best (TTB) might be too blunt to accurately capture the threshold at which subjects switch to Weighted Additive (WADD) or Tallying strategies.
Rationale: To further close the gap on compensatory experiments (Exps 2, 4, 20) while remaining within the Strategy Mixture family, refine the environment-conflict metric. Instead of using the raw standard deviation of validities, compute a more theoretically grounded 'compensatory gap'—such as the difference between the maximum validity and the mean of the remaining validities. This better reflects whether the best cue dominates the rest. Additionally, expand the range of `disp_threshold` (e.g., to [0.0, 1.0]) to give the fitting process more room to find the optimal tipping point between TTB and WADD.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.4154 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.4433 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model attempted to refine the environment-adaptive strategy selection by replacing the standard deviation of validities with a 'compensatory gap' metric (max validity minus mean of the rest). However, this change was rejected by the accept-gate, as the aggregate loss worsened from 0.4154 to 0.4433. The misfits on compensatory-heavy experiments (e.g., Exps 2, 4, 13, 20) remain problematic or worsened. This indicates that the 'compensatory gap' formulation is less effective at capturing the population's strategy-switching threshold than the previous standard deviation approach.
Rationale: Since the 'compensatory gap' metric was rejected by the gate, the proposer should revert to using the standard deviation (or variance) of the validities as the environment dispersion metric, as it was more successful in Iteration 2. To further close the gap on Exps 2, 4, and 20 without repeating the failed advice, focus on the compensatory strategy itself. Currently, WADD weights features by `(val - 0.5)^gamma`. In low-dispersion environments, human behavior often collapses to pure Tallying (equal weights). Ensure that the model can easily approximate pure Tallying by either allowing `gamma` to tightly approach 0, or by explicitly formulating the compensatory strategy as a blend or selection between WADD and pure Tallying. Additionally, consider widening the range of `theta` or using a softer activation function for `p_ttb` to prevent the strategy mixture from becoming too deterministic too quickly.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.4433 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.4022 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The model successfully integrated the advice to blend Tallying and WADD within the compensatory branch, achieving a new best aggregate loss of 0.4022 and acceptance by the gate. The explicit `alpha` parameter successfully allowed the model to approximate pure Tallying when needed, improving the fit on Exps 3, 5, and 10. However, there are still substantial misfits in Exps 4, 13, 20, and 22. In particular, the model strongly underpredicts human choices in Exps 4 and 22, and overpredicts in Exp 13. This suggests that the compensatory strategy's weighting scheme might still be slightly off.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "While the current model is the best so far, it can be further refined by addressing the WADD weight normalization. Currently, `centered_val` is divided by `max_c`, forcing the highest validity feature to always have a weight of 1.0 before the `gamma` exponentiation. This scale-invariance removes the absolute magnitude of the validities from the compensatory score, meaning a feature with a validity of 0.55 gets the same weight as one with 0.95 if it happens to be the maximum. This prevents the `beta` parameter from naturally scaling the choice confidence based on the overall strength of evidence in the environment. Remove the `max_c` normalization and simply use `w_wadd = centered_val ** gamma` (or `(centered_val * 2) ** gamma` to keep it bounded [0,1]). This minor adjustment will allow the absolute validity magnitudes to properly influence the compensatory choice probabilities, likely improving fits on Exps 4, 20, and 22."
