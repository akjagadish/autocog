# generation_iter_03_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_13`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_13`).

Propose a 'Strategy Mixture' or 'Adaptive Toolbox' theory. Instead of assuming a single fixed strategy (either purely compensatory or purely sequential), this theory should posit that decision-makers possess a repertoire of strategies (e.g., Take-The-Best and Tallying/WADD) and probabilistically apply them. The probability of selecting a strategy could be a free parameter or depend on the cognitive conflict/dispersion of the validities. This would allow the model to seamlessly blend the strong non-compensatory choices observed in Exps 1 and 2 with the compensatory behaviors observed in other experiments, capturing the population-level heterogeneity that single-strategy models miss.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.475)

**Description**
Decision-makers use a Sequential Evidence Accumulation strategy with a stopping rule. They inspect features one by one in descending order of their validity, maintaining a running sum of the differences between the options. If the absolute accumulated evidence reaches or exceeds a specific threshold, they stop and make a choice based on that evidence. If the threshold is not reached, they evaluate all features and decide based on the final tally. This allows the model to smoothly transition between Take-The-Best (low threshold) and Tallying (high threshold) behaviors.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.347)

**Description**
People primarily compare multi-attribute options using a Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features on which each option is strictly better. The option with the higher tally is chosen. However, if the tallies are tied, the decision-maker falls back to a compensatory tie-breaking mechanism, evaluating the options based on the weighted sum of their features. The weights correspond to feature validities centered at chance and non-linearly scaled by a parameter gamma, allowing flexible adjustment of the tie-breaker's sensitivity to validity differences.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):

### `pi_13` (overall score: 0.299)

**Description**
Decision-makers use a purely compensatory Weighted Additive Strategy (WADD). Instead of applying early stopping or lexicographic rules, individuals evaluate all available features for both options. Each feature is weighted by a non-linear transformation of its objective validity, capturing varying sensitivities to evidence strength. The overall subjective value of an option is the sum of its weighted features, and choices are made probabilistically based on the difference in these overall values. By allowing for very large scaling parameters, the model can approximate non-compensatory behavior within a purely compensatory framework.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.4340 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.4154 -> ACCEPTED

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Strategy 1: Take-The-Best (TTB)
    # Inspect features in descending order of validity; stop at the first discriminating feature.
    order = np.argsort(val)[::-1]
    ttb_prob = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            ttb_prob = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            ttb_prob = np.array([0.0, 1.0])

    # Strategy 2: Weighted Additive (WADD) / Tallying
    # Evaluate all features, weighting them by a non-linear transformation of their validity.
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    centered_val = np.clip(val - 0.5, 1e-6, 0.5)
    w = centered_val ** gamma
    wadd_scores = np.array([np.sum(a * w), np.sum(b * w)])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    z = beta * wadd_scores
    z -= np.max(z)  # numerical stability
    e = np.exp(z)
    wadd_prob = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Strategy Mixture: Probabilistic selection between TTB and WADD based on environment
    # The probability of selecting TTB depends on the dispersion (std dev) of the validities.
    dispersion = float(np.std(val))
    theta = float(parameters["theta"])
    disp_threshold = float(parameters["disp_threshold"])
    
    z_disp = theta * (dispersion - disp_threshold)
    p_ttb = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-np.clip(z_disp, -20.0, 20.0)))
    
    p_core = p_ttb * ttb_prob + (1.0 - p_ttb) * wadd_prob
    
    # Trembling hand error
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- theta: [0.0, 100.0]
- disp_threshold: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.0, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the critic's advice, the Strategy Mixture model is modified so that the probability of choosing the Take-The-Best (TTB) strategy (`p_ttb`) is no longer a fixed parameter. Instead, it is dynamically computed as a logistic function of the dispersion (standard deviation) of the feature validities in the current environment. This enables the model to probabilistically deploy TTB when the validities are highly skewed (high dispersion) and default to Weighted Additive/Tallying when the validities are relatively flat (low dispersion), thus capturing the environment-driven shifts in strategy adoption across different experiments.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Strategy Mixture model successfully combines TTB and WADD, earning an acceptance from the gate with an improved aggregate loss (0.4340). However, it still exhibits severe misfits on several experiments where compensatory or tallying behaviors strongly dominate (e.g., Exps 2, 4, 5) versus experiments where non-compensatory choices prevail. The current limitation stems from using a single, fixed free parameter `p_ttb` across all environments. Since different experiments employ different validity structures, a fixed probability cannot capture the environment-driven shifts in strategy adoption.
Rationale: While the candidate correctly implemented the prescribed Strategy Mixture family, it missed the arbiter's suggestion to make the strategy selection probability depend on the environment. I recommend modifying the model so that `p_ttb` is not a raw free parameter, but rather a function of the dispersion or conflict in the `validities` vector (e.g., a logistic function of the variance of the validities, or the gap between the highest validity and the average of the rest, governed by new sensitivity parameters). This will allow the model to dynamically deploy TTB when validities are highly skewed and WADD/Tallying when validities are relatively flat, resolving the tension between Exp 1/14 and Exp 2/4/5 without leaving the mechanism family.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4340 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.4154 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model successfully implemented the dynamic strategy selection based on environment dispersion, leading to a reduction in aggregate loss (0.4154) and acceptance by the gate. However, the model still heavily underpredicts compensatory behaviors in several key experiments, notably Experiments 2, 4, and 20, where the deviations from human data remain substantial. The use of the standard deviation of validities as the sole driver for the probability of selecting Take-The-Best (TTB) might be too blunt to accurately capture the threshold at which subjects switch to Weighted Additive (WADD) or Tallying strategies.
Rationale: To further close the gap on compensatory experiments (Exps 2, 4, 20) while remaining within the Strategy Mixture family, refine the environment-conflict metric. Instead of using the raw standard deviation of validities, compute a more theoretically grounded 'compensatory gap'—such as the difference between the maximum validity and the mean of the remaining validities. This better reflects whether the best cue dominates the rest. Additionally, expand the range of `disp_threshold` (e.g., to [0.0, 1.0]) to give the fitting process more room to find the optimal tipping point between TTB and WADD.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.4154 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.4433 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model attempted to refine the environment-adaptive strategy selection by replacing the standard deviation of validities with a 'compensatory gap' metric (max validity minus mean of the rest). However, this change was rejected by the accept-gate, as the aggregate loss worsened from 0.4154 to 0.4433. The misfits on compensatory-heavy experiments (e.g., Exps 2, 4, 13, 20) remain problematic or worsened. This indicates that the 'compensatory gap' formulation is less effective at capturing the population's strategy-switching threshold than the previous standard deviation approach.
Rationale: Since the 'compensatory gap' metric was rejected by the gate, the proposer should revert to using the standard deviation (or variance) of the validities as the environment dispersion metric, as it was more successful in Iteration 2. To further close the gap on Exps 2, 4, and 20 without repeating the failed advice, focus on the compensatory strategy itself. Currently, WADD weights features by `(val - 0.5)^gamma`. In low-dispersion environments, human behavior often collapses to pure Tallying (equal weights). Ensure that the model can easily approximate pure Tallying by either allowing `gamma` to tightly approach 0, or by explicitly formulating the compensatory strategy as a blend or selection between WADD and pure Tallying. Additionally, consider widening the range of `theta` or using a softer activation function for `p_ttb` to prevent the strategy mixture from becoming too deterministic too quickly.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.4433 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
