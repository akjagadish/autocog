# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_11" and "pi_9") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_11" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_9" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_11
Decision-makers use a Validity-Weighted Sequential Accumulation strategy. They inspect features one by one in descending order of validity, accumulating evidence proportional to a non-linear transformation of each feature's chance-centered validity. If the absolute value of this weighted accumulated evidence reaches or exceeds a specific threshold, they stop and make a choice. Otherwise, they evaluate all features and decide based on the final weighted tally. The weight transformation uses the absolute chance-centered validity raised to a power, preserving the sign, to avoid numerical errors while allowing interpolation between Tallying and Take-The-Best.

## THEORY 2 — pi_9
Decision-makers use a Sequential Evidence Accumulation strategy with a stopping rule. They inspect features one by one in descending order of their validity, maintaining a running sum of the differences between the options. If the absolute accumulated evidence reaches or exceeds a specific threshold, they stop and make a choice based on that evidence. If the threshold is not reached, they evaluate all features and decide based on the final tally. This allows the model to smoothly transition between Take-The-Best (low threshold) and Tallying (high threshold) behaviors.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_11)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.6, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Validity-Weighted Sequential Accumulation) from the Competing Theory (Unweighted Sequential Evidence Accumulation), we exploit the difference between accumulating continuous weighted evidence versus discrete unweighted (+1/-1) steps. By using a steep set of validities, we can construct trials where the unweighted running tally fluctuates between -1 and +1, ending on -1 (so the Competing Theory predicts a strict preference for B regardless of its threshold, as early stopping at 1 also favors B). In contrast, the Advocated Theory weights features by a non-linear transformation of their chance-centered validities. Thus, a combination of the 2nd and 3rd best features can overpower the 1st, 4th, and 5th best features, resulting in a positive final weighted tally. This creates a stark dissociation where the Competing Theory structurally must choose B, while the Advocated Theory can robustly choose A.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times subjects choose the option [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] when it is presented (Trials 1 and 2). For the Competing Theory, the unweighted tally starts at -1 and ends at -1, meaning it structurally must always choose the opposing option [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] regardless of the stopping threshold (barring epsilon noise). For the Advocated Theory, the non-linear weighting of chance-centered validities allows the combination of the 2nd and 3rd features to overpower the 1st, 4th, and 5th features. With a moderate to high threshold, the Advocated Theory will robustly choose the target option [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], creating a stark and highly discriminative contrast.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_9)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.94, 0.93, 0.6, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Unweighted Sequential Evidence Accumulation) from the Competing Theory (Validity-Weighted Sequential Accumulation), we exploit the difference between unweighted (+1/-1) and weighted evidence accumulation. By setting validities with a tight high cluster (0.95, 0.94, 0.93) and a drop-off (0.60, 0.55), we can construct trials where the unweighted running tally fluctuates but structurally forces the Advocated Theory to predict one option regardless of its threshold, whereas the Competing Theory's weighted sum overcomes the early deficit and predicts the opposite option for any non-minimal threshold.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes a double difference in the choice proportions of option B across the four trial types. For the Advocated Theory (Unweighted), Trials 1 and 2 structurally force choices of B and A respectively regardless of threshold, making (m1 - m2) strongly positive (~1). Meanwhile, its choices on Trials 3 and 4 depend heavily on the threshold, averaging out across subjects. For the Competing Theory (Weighted), the opposite is true: its choices on Trials 3 and 4 are structurally forced to B and A respectively because the heavy validities align, making (m3 - m4) strongly positive (~1), while Trials 1 and 2 are threshold-dependent. The double difference thus yields opposite signs for the two theories, ensuring strong discrimination.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the suite of experiments, Theory 2 (Unweighted Sequential Evidence Accumulation) consistently outperforms Theory 1 (Validity-Weighted Sequential Accumulation). In Experiment 1, Theory 2 accurately predicts the low choice rate for the target option (0.1375 vs observed 0.1283), while Theory 1 drastically overpredicts it (0.6004). Similarly, in Experiment 2, Theory 2 correctly captures the large negative double difference (-1.055 vs observed -1.4933), whereas Theory 1 predicts a positive value. In Experiment 19, Theory 2 is remarkably close (0.1385 vs observed 0.1523), while Theory 1 misses completely (0.5685). Theory 1's non-linear weighting of chance-centered validities frequently causes it to overvalue combinations of lower-validity cues, leading to severe mispredictions. Since Theory 2 represents a robust baseline that unifies Take-The-Best and Tallying via an unweighted threshold, Theory 1 should be replaced with a qualitatively different mechanism to explore alternative cognitive architectures.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Two-Phase Heuristic' (or 'Take-The-Best with Tallying Fallback') theory. In this theory, decision-makers do not accumulate evidence sequentially across all features. Instead, they first apply a strict lexicographic rule (Take-The-Best), examining the most valid feature. If this feature discriminates between the options, they make a choice immediately. If the most valid feature is tied, they abandon sequential evaluation and instead perform a simple unweighted Tally of all remaining features to break the tie. This differs from Theory 2 (which maintains a running unweighted sum and checks a threshold at each step) and Theory 1 (which uses complex weighted sums), offering a hybrid discrete-stage approach that might better capture behaviors in trials with early ties."
