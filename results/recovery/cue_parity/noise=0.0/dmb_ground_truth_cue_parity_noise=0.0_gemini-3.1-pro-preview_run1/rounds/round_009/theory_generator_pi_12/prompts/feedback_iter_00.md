# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_11`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_11`).

Propose a 'Two-Phase Heuristic' (or 'Take-The-Best with Tallying Fallback') theory. In this theory, decision-makers do not accumulate evidence sequentially across all features. Instead, they first apply a strict lexicographic rule (Take-The-Best), examining the most valid feature. If this feature discriminates between the options, they make a choice immediately. If the most valid feature is tied, they abandon sequential evaluation and instead perform a simple unweighted Tally of all remaining features to break the tie. This differs from Theory 2 (which maintains a running unweighted sum and checks a threshold at each step) and Theory 1 (which uses complex weighted sums), offering a hybrid discrete-stage approach that might better capture behaviors in trials with early ties.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Two-Phase Heuristic (Take-The-Best with Tallying Fallback): Decision-makers do not accumulate evidence sequentially across all features. Instead, they first evaluate the single most valid feature. If this feature discriminates between the options, a choice is made immediately based on it. If this most valid feature is tied, they abandon sequential lexicographic evaluation and instead perform a simple unweighted Tally of all remaining features to break the tie.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Identify the most valid feature
    best_idx = np.argmax(val)
    diff_best = a[best_idx] - b[best_idx]
    
    if diff_best != 0:
        # Phase 1: The most valid feature discriminates
        scores = np.array([diff_best, -diff_best])
    else:
        # Phase 2: The most valid feature is tied; Tally the remaining features
        mask = np.ones(len(a), dtype=bool)
        mask[best_idx] = False
        tally_a = np.sum(a[mask])
        tally_b = np.sum(b[mask])
        
        tally_scale = float(parameters["tally_scale"])
        scores = tally_scale * np.array([tally_a, tally_b])
        
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * scores
    z -= np.max(z)
    p_core = np.exp(z) / np.sum(np.exp(z))
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 15.0]
- tally_scale: [0.1, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory implements a hybrid 'Two-Phase' strategy. It checks the single most valid feature first (Take-The-Best logic). If that feature differentiates the options, the decision is made immediately. If the best feature is tied, it completely abandons sequential checking and instead falls back to an unweighted Tally of all remaining features. This avoids the sequential accumulation of Theory 2 and the weighted compensatory integration of Theory 1, providing a discrete, distinct fallback mechanism that captures heuristic switching behaviors on early ties.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4675 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4675.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate implements the prescribed Two-Phase Heuristic (TTB with Tally fallback) and was accepted as the new running best. However, it severely misfits several experiments where human behavior deviates from strict TTB on the first feature. For instance, in Experiment 4 and 12, the candidate goes strongly in the opposite direction of human data (Exp 4 Cand=0.15 vs Real=0.85; Exp 12 Cand=-0.75 vs Real=0.02). This suggests that while the mechanism family is fixed by the arbiter, the deterministic rigidness of Phase 1 (TTB) is forcing the model into extreme predictions that real subjects do not make.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "To improve fit within the prescribed family, the intensity of the TTB phase needs to be decoupled from the Tallying phase. Currently, Phase 1 sets scores to strictly [diff_best, -diff_best] which are then multiplied by beta, while Phase 2 uses tally_scale. Introduce a new parameter `ttb_weight` (e.g., [0.1, 10.0]) to scale the Phase 1 scores (i.e., `scores = ttb_weight * np.array([diff_best, -diff_best])`). This will allow the model to calibrate the determinism of the TTB phase independently from the Tallying phase, potentially softening the extreme misses in experiments where TTB points in the wrong direction."
