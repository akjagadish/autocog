# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People primarily compare multi-attribute options using a Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features on which each option is strictly better. The option with the higher tally is chosen. However, if the tallies are tied, the decision-maker falls back to a compensatory tie-breaking mechanism, evaluating the options based on the weighted sum of their features. The weights correspond to feature validities centered at chance and non-linearly scaled by a parameter gamma, allowing flexible adjustment of the tie-breaker's sensitivity to validity differences.

**Rationale:** The previous base model already centered the validities, so to further refine the weighted sum tie-breaker as requested, we introduce a non-linear scaling parameter `gamma` (similar to the successful pi_3 model). This allows the tie-breaker to flexibly weight the centered validities, improving the fit for Experiments 1 and 3 by modulating how strongly differences in validity affect the tie-breaking scores, while keeping the base noise parameters intact to avoid overpredicting the Tallying-driven choices in Experiments 2 and 4.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.8]`
  - `tie_scale`: `[1.0, 20.0]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 5.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Primary stage: Tallying feature wins
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    
    if a_wins != b_wins:
        scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    else:
        # Secondary stage: Validity-weighted tie-breaker with non-linear scaling
        val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
        gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
        centered_val = val - 0.5
        w = np.sign(centered_val) * (np.abs(centered_val) ** gamma)
        tie_scale = float(parameters["tie_scale"])
        scores = tie_scale * np.array([np.sum(a * w), np.sum(b * w)])
        
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Salience-Weighted Tallying with Near-Tie Threshold: Decision-makers primarily rely on a non-compensatory Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features where one option dominates the other. However, if the difference in tallies is small (below a specific threshold), a secondary compensatory evaluation is triggered. In this tie-breaking phase, the weights of the features are dynamically adjusted based on their salience rather than strictly their objective validity, allowing less predictive features to become disproportionately salient and overweighted during conflict resolution.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we retain the successful two-stage logic from Iteration 1 but relax the strict tie condition. By introducing a `tally_threshold` parameter, the model can drop to the salience-weighted tie-breaker for 'near-ties' as well as strict ties. This minimal edit softens the rigid boundary of pure tallying, improving fit on intermediate conflict trials (Exps 1 and 2) while preserving the highly successful strict-tie behavior that perfectly captures preference reversals in Exps 4-6.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[-5.0, 5.0]`
  - `tie_scale`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `tally_threshold`: `[0.0, 2.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
