# generation_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_12`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_12`).

Replace the Mixture Model with a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. The new theory should state that decision-makers compute a compensatory utility for each option by taking the dot product of the option's feature vector and the provided cue validities. Choices are then made probabilistically using a softmax function over these utilities, parameterized by an inverse temperature (beta) and a lapse rate (epsilon). This allows all features to contribute proportionally to their stated validities, cleanly capturing data where both tallying and strict TTB fail.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.595)

**Description**
Frugal Threshold Heuristic: Decision-makers evaluate cues in descending order of their validities, keeping a running tally of the net evidence (the difference in the number of winning cues between the two options). Rather than strictly stopping at the first discriminating cue (Take-The-Best) or exhaustively integrating all cues (Pure Tallying), subjects stop searching as soon as the absolute evidence difference reaches a subject-specific cognitive threshold. A threshold of 1 perfectly recovers Take-The-Best, while a high threshold recovers Pure Tallying. Intermediate thresholds represent boundedly rational strategies that compute tallies over a frugal subset of cues.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.588)

**Description**
Tallying with Salience-Biased Tie-Breaking (Normalized Mixture with Flexible Scaling): Decision-makers evaluate options by integrating two separate signals. The primary signal is a pure Tally (counting the number of winning features for each option). The secondary signal is a non-linear validity-weighted score that can either penalize missing top-validity features or, conversely, over-weight lower-validity features depending on the individual's cognitive strategy. Both signals are normalized to a [0, 1] scale before being linearly mixed by an individual-specific parameter 'alpha'. Allowing the non-linear scaling parameter 'gamma' to take negative values captures the empirical phenomenon where some subjects strongly prefer options that win on lower-validity features when the tally is tied.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.569)

**Description**
Decision-makers in binary choice tasks employ a mixture of strategies, primarily relying on the compensatory Tallying heuristic, with a smaller fraction using the non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. TTB processes cues lexicographically, searching through features in descending order of their validities and stopping at the first feature that discriminates between the options. Tallying counts the total number of winning features for each option regardless of validity. By skewing the population mixture heavily toward Tallying, the model captures the dominant compensatory behavior observed in human data while retaining enough lexicographic influence to explain subtle choice variances.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.5563 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.5536 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.6111 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.5815 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.5536 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory with Subjective Weighting: Decision-makers evaluate options by computing a compensatory utility for each, taking the dot product of the option's feature vector and a subjectively transformed set of cue validities. A non-linear parameter (gamma) scales the provided validities, allowing individuals to interpolate between equal weighting (Tallying) and extreme weighting. Choices are made probabilistically using a softmax function over these utilities, parameterized by an inverse temperature (beta) and a lapse rate (epsilon).

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD model expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Subjective weighting of validities
    w = val ** gamma
    
    # Compute compensatory utility as the dot product of features and subjective validities
    u_a = np.dot(a, w)
    u_b = np.dot(b, w)
    
    scores = np.array([u_a, u_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.0, 5.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Introduced a non-linear transformation parameter `gamma` to the cue validities. This subjective weighting parameter allows the model to smoothly interpolate between Tallying (when gamma is near 0, all weights become close to 1) and strict validity weighting (when gamma is high). This provides the flexibility needed to capture human behavior in experiments where subjects exhibit Tally-like choices rather than strict WADD based on raw validities, resolving the directional failures seen in the previous iteration.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the arbiter's prescribed Weighted Additive (WADD) model and was accepted by the gate as an improvement over the baseline. However, the model struggles significantly on experiments where human subjects exhibit Tallying-like or non-compensatory behavior (e.g., Experiments 3, 4, 9, 10, and 11). In these experiments, the strict dot product of raw validities forces predictions in the opposite direction of human behavior. Consequently, the parameter fitting process is forced to use a low inverse temperature (beta) or high lapse rate (epsilon) to squash predictions toward random guessing (0.5) and minimize penalty, rather than capturing the actual behavioral pattern.
Rationale: While keeping the WADD mechanism strictly intact, the model needs more flexibility in how it treats the provided validities to capture the Tally-like behavior seen in several experiments. Introduce a subjective weighting parameter `gamma` (e.g., range [0.0, 5.0]) that applies a non-linear transformation to the validities before the dot product: `w_i = validities_i ** gamma`. This minor adjustment stays within the WADD family but allows the model to smoothly interpolate between equal weighting/Tallying (gamma near 0) and extreme weighting (high gamma), which should resolve the directional failures in Experiments 3, 4, 9, and 10.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5563 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.5536 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The introduction of the `gamma` parameter for subjective weighting was accepted by the gate, slightly improving the aggregate loss. However, the model still suffers from massive directional failures on experiments where subjects rely heavily on Tallying or non-compensatory heuristics (e.g., Experiments 3, 4, 9, 10, and 11). For instance, in Experiment 3, the model predicts 0.7200 where humans are at 0.1317, and in Experiment 4 it predicts -0.5350 where humans are at 0.6933. The power-law transformation `val ** gamma` might be numerically restrictive depending on the scale of the provided validities (e.g., if validities are large integers vs. probabilities), preventing the model from smoothly reaching the uniform-weighting (Tallying) regime during parameter fitting.
Rationale: While the subjective weighting approach is correct and stays within the WADD family, the power-law transformation `w = val ** gamma` is likely causing scaling or gradient issues during fitting. Change the subjective weighting function to an exponential transformation: `w = np.exp(gamma * val)`. This guarantees positive weights and smoothly interpolates between uniform weighting / Tallying (when gamma = 0, all weights become 1) and extreme validity weighting (when gamma is large). Adjust the `gamma` parameter range to `[-1.0, 10.0]` to give the model ample flexibility to flatten or sharpen the weights regardless of the raw scale of the `validities`.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.5536 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.6111 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The exponential transformation for subjective weighting was rejected by the gate, meaning it performed worse than the previous power-law approach (`val ** gamma`). However, the accepted base model still struggles with experiments where humans exhibit Tallying behavior (e.g., Experiments 3, 4, 9, 10). The likely reason the fit cannot easily locate the Tallying regime (gamma near 0) is that altering `gamma` in `val ** gamma` drastically changes the overall magnitude of the weights, and therefore the scale of the utilities. This creates a strong confounding interaction with the `beta` (inverse temperature) parameter during fitting, preventing the optimizer from smoothly interpolating between Tallying and validity-weighting.
Rationale: Return to the power-law transformation (`val ** gamma`) that was previously accepted, but normalize the weights so they sum to 1: `w = (val ** gamma) / np.sum(val ** gamma)`. This ensures that the scale of the compensatory utilities remains bounded and stable regardless of the `gamma` value, decoupling the subjective weighting from the `beta` parameter. This minor adjustment stays strictly within the prescribed WADD family but should drastically improve the optimizer's ability to find Tallying-like solutions (when `gamma=0`, weights become uniform) without disrupting the softmax temperature. Use a `gamma` range of `[0.0, 10.0]`.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.6111 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.5815 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate's attempt to normalize the power-law subjective weighting was rejected by the gate, meaning the unnormalized power-law from iteration 2 remains the running-best base. However, the power-law transformation (`val ** gamma`) is highly sensitive to the raw scale of the provided validities (which can vary wildly across experiments), leading to numerical instability and confounding with the softmax temperature during parameter fitting. This prevents the model from robustly capturing the Tallying-like behavior seen in Experiments 3, 4, 9, and 10.
Rationale: The non-linear transformations (power-law, exponential) have reached a dead end and cause scaling issues. Instead, stay within the WADD family but replace the power-law subjective weighting with a simple linear interpolation between uniform weighting (Tallying) and the provided validities. Introduce an `alpha` parameter in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`. Compute the weights as: `w = (1.0 - alpha) * 1.0 + alpha * val`. This guarantees a smooth, numerically stable interpolation between pure Tallying (`alpha=0`, all weights equal 1) and pure validity weighting (`alpha=1`), completely avoiding the exploding utility scales that plagued the `gamma` exponent.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.5815 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
