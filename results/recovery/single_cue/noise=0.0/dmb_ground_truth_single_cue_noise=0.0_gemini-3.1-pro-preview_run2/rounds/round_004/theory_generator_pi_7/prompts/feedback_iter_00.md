# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Replace the WADD theory with the Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. The TTB theory should posit that decision-makers process cues lexicographically: they search through features in descending order of their validities, stop at the first feature that discriminates between the two options (one option has a 1, the other a 0), and choose the option favored by that cue. If no cues discriminate, they guess randomly. This introduces a non-compensatory heuristic that strongly contrasts with Tallying (which integrates all cues equally) and can help explain the ~0.50 observed in Experiment 10 if we assume a mixture of TTB and Tallying strategies in the population.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Decision-makers in binary choice tasks employ a mixture of strategies, primarily relying on either the non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic or the compensatory Tallying heuristic. TTB processes cues lexicographically, searching through features in descending order of their validities and stopping at the first feature that discriminates between the options. Tallying, on the other hand, counts the total number of winning features for each option regardless of validity. The population consists of individuals who use a probabilistic mixture of these two strategies, allowing the model to capture both extreme lexicographic behavior and equal-weighting integration.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:

    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Mixture model expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- w_ttb: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's feedback, the WADD theory was replaced with a mixture of the Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying heuristics. TTB introduces a strongly non-compensatory mechanism by evaluating cues lexicographically (descending order of validity) and stopping at the first discriminating cue. Mixing this with Tallying (which integrates all cues equally) accommodates the heterogeneity in decision-making strategies across the population, capturing both hierarchical cue usage and robust uniform integration, which helps explain the observed metric variances.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4020 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4020.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate implements a mixture of Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying, as requested by the arbiter. With `w_ttb` sampled from [0.0, 1.0], the average simulated subject uses a 50/50 mixture. This perfectly captures Experiment 8 (observed 0.4975, candidate 0.4700). However, it severely misses the mark on almost all other experiments where human behavior strongly favors Tallying/compensatory strategies: Exp 2 (observed 0.84, candidate 0.49), Exp 3 (observed 0.13, candidate 0.49), Exp 4 (observed 0.69, candidate 0.00), Exp 9 (observed 0.11, candidate 0.50), and Exp 10 (observed 0.14, candidate 0.49). The population does not use TTB 50% of the time; Tallying is the dominant strategy.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The mixture mechanism is correct and should be kept, but the parameter range for `w_ttb` is far too wide, pulling predictions toward 0.50 across the board. To better fit the aggregate data, the population must be heavily skewed toward Tallying while retaining a smaller fraction of TTB. Reduce the range of `w_ttb` from [0.0, 1.0] to [0.0, 0.3] or [0.0, 0.4]. This will allow the model to capture the strong compensatory behavior in Exps 2, 3, 4, 9, and 10, while still providing enough non-compensatory variance to soften the predictions relative to a pure Tallying model."
