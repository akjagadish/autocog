# Round 16 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_16` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Recency-Biased Cue Overweighting: Decision-makers evaluate options by attempting to integrate all available features, but due to visual recency and short-term memory effects, the final feature in the sequence is disproportionately salient. While the first N-1 features are weighted according to their stated validities (subject to non-linear scaling), the final feature is assigned an independent, often much larger weight. This mechanism explains boundary cases where subjects' choices are driven by the nominally least valid cue, effectively overriding both compensatory tallying and the expected Take-The-Best hierarchy.

**Rationale:** The arbiter provided feedback indicating a need for a model where the final feature in the sequence is highly salient due to visual recency, causing it to disproportionately drive choice. This model instantiates 'Recency-Biased Cue Overweighting' by computing a weighted additive score where the first N-1 features are weighted by their validities (scaled by a parameter gamma), but the final feature is assigned an independent, freely varying 'recency_weight'. This enables the model to capture empirical boundary cases where the nominally least valid feature dominates the decision, explaining variance that pure TTB or Tallying fail to account for.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `recency_weight`: `[0.0, 10.0]`

### slot 2 — `pi_18` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Serial Position Dual-Overweighting: Decision-makers evaluate options by integrating features, but due to memory and attention constraints at the sequence boundaries, both the first (primacy) and the last (recency) cues are assigned independent, disproportionately large weights. Unlike models that normalize attention or weights, these boundary weights are unnormalized, allowing them to independently dominate choice when necessary. Middle cues are weighted by their stated validities, scaled non-linearly. This mechanism captures both extreme primacy and extreme recency effects without the dampening effect of weight normalization.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's guidance, this theory introduces 'Serial Position Dual-Overweighting'. It assigns independent, unnormalized weights to both the first (primacy) and last (recency) cues, while scaling the middle cues according to their stated validities. By omitting weight normalization, the model prevents the dampening of these extreme boundary weights, enabling it to fully capture the strong primacy and recency effects observed in experiments like Exp 2 and Exp 31.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `primacy_weight`: `[0.0, 10.0]`

## Replacement

### `pi_19` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Primacy-Dominant Anchoring: Decision-makers use the first cue as a powerful anchor that overwhelmingly dominates the evaluation process. While the final cue may receive a secondary recency boost due to short-term memory, the primacy weight is structurally much larger than both the recency weight and the middle cue validities. This explicitly enforces a hierarchy where primacy is the primary driver of choice.

**Rationale:** Based on the arbiter's feedback, this theory models a 'Primacy-Dominant Anchoring' mechanism. Instead of treating primacy and recency as symmetric boundary effects or purely overweighting recency, this model explicitly enforces a hierarchy where the first cue acts as a massive anchor (weight range [10, 30]), while the final cue can have a secondary recency effect (weight range [0, 9]), and middle cues carry their base validities. This captures the strong empirical phenomenon where subjects base choices almost entirely on the initial anchor cue, overriding both compensatory tallying and recency when they conflict.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `primacy_weight`: `[10.0, 30.0]`
