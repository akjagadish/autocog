# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_10`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_10`).

Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. In this theory, decision-makers evaluate each option by computing a weighted sum of its features, where the weights are a function of the cue validities (e.g., the validities themselves, or their log-odds). The choice probability is then determined by a softmax function over these option values, incorporating decision noise and a lapse rate. This theory can smoothly interpolate between Tallying (if weights are relatively flat/similar) and validity-driven choices (when validities differ significantly), explaining both the tally-like behavior in some experiments and the strong validity dependence in others.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory: Decision-makers evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their features. The subjective weight of each feature is a non-linear function of its cue validity (modeled as a power function, w_i = v_i^gamma). This allows the strategy to smoothly interpolate between pure Tallying (gamma = 0, equal weights) and Take-The-Best-like lexicographic behavior (large gamma, highest validity dominates). Choices are made probabilistically using a softmax over the computed option values, subject to decision noise and a lapse rate.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD model expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Transform validities into subjective weights
    # gamma=0 yields Tallying; large gamma yields TTB-like behavior
    w = val ** gamma
    
    # Compute the weighted additive value for each option
    score_a = np.sum(w * a)
    score_b = np.sum(w * b)
    
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.0, 20.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's feedback, we implement a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. The model assigns a subjective weight to each feature as a power function of its validity (w_i = v_i^gamma). This naturally allows the model to interpolate between Tallying (when gamma = 0, all weights are 1) and Take-The-Best (when gamma is large, higher-validity features exponentially dominate). Options are evaluated by taking the dot product of their features and these subjective weights. A softmax function with decision noise (beta) and a lapse rate (epsilon) translates the difference in option values into choice probabilities. This provides a unified compensatory framework that captures both validity-driven and tally-like behavior across experiments.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.6220 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.6220.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate implements the prescribed WADD model with weights w_i = v_i^gamma. While this theoretically interpolates between Tallying and Take-The-Best, the simulation shows extreme deviations from human behavior across most experiments. For example, in Exp 3, the observed metric is 0.1317 but the candidate predicts 0.8067. In Exp 4, the observed is 0.6933 but the candidate predicts -0.6867. This suggests the model is strongly predicting the exact opposite of human preferences in critical conflict trials. The power function w_i = v_i^gamma might be scaling the validities in a way that creates extreme, non-compensatory weights too quickly, or fails to capture the normative log-odds scaling of evidence.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate remains faithful to the WADD family but the specific weighting function (w_i = v_i^gamma) causes the model to make predictions perfectly anti-aligned with human data in several experiments (e.g., Exps 3, 4, 9, 10). Try a different weighting scheme, such as log-odds: w_i = log(v_i / (1 - v_i)), optionally scaled or mixed with a flat weight (e.g., w_i = (1-gamma) + gamma * log_odds), to better align with the normative accumulation of evidence. Also, ensure that the validities are bounded away from 0 and 1 before taking the log to prevent infinities. Keep the softmax and lapse rate intact."
