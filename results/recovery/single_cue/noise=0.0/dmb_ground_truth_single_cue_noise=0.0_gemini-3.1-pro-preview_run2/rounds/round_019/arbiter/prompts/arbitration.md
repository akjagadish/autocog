# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_19" and "pi_21") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_19" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_21" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_19
Primacy-Dominant Anchoring: Decision-makers use the first cue as a powerful anchor that overwhelmingly dominates the evaluation process. While the final cue may receive a secondary recency boost due to short-term memory, the primacy weight is structurally much larger than both the recency weight and the middle cue validities. This explicitly enforces a hierarchy where primacy is the primary driver of choice.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_19)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 9: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Primacy-Dominant Anchoring (Advocated Theory) from Validity-Weighted Evidence Accumulation with Normalized Attention Decay (Competing Theory), we exploit their structural differences regarding the first and last cues. The Advocated Theory strictly enforces a massive, unnormalized primacy weight (10-30) that dominates all other cues, and an independent recency weight (0-9) that dominates the middle cues. The Competing Theory uses a single decay parameter that normalizes all weights; if decay > 1, the last cue can dominate the first cue, a pattern strictly forbidden by the Advocated Theory. If decay < 1, the Competing Theory mimics primacy but enforces a strict exponential drop-off, meaning the second cue will dominate the last cue if the first is tied. We include trials pitting the first cue against all others, the last cue against all others, and trials where the first cue is tied to expose how the models resolve secondary preferences (independent recency vs. continuous exponential decay).

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The Advocated Theory (Primacy-Dominant Anchoring) enforces a massive structural weight (10-30) on the first cue. Therefore, whenever the first cue differs between options A and B, the model will overwhelmingly choose the option favored by the first cue, leading to an alignment score near 1.0. In contrast, the Competing Theory uses normalized attention decay. Because the decay parameter can be greater than 1 (making later cues dominate) or less than 1 (allowing multiple subsequent cues to collectively outweigh the first cue), its choices will frequently contradict the first cue, resulting in a substantially lower average alignment score.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_21)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.65, 0.85, 0.75, 0.8, 0.7]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Validity-Weighted Evidence Accumulation with Normalized Attention Decay (Advocated Theory) from Primacy-Dominant Anchoring (Competing Theory), we exploit their structural differences regarding weight normalization and the relationship between primacy and recency. The Competing Theory enforces a massive, unnormalized primacy weight that always dominates, and an independent recency weight that typically dominates middle cues. The Advocated Theory uses a continuous exponential decay parameter that can either produce primacy (decay < 1) or recency (decay > 1), and normalizes weights to bound the maximum score difference. We include trials where the first cue opposes all other cues (forcing the Competing Theory to choose the first cue, while the Advocated Theory can choose the alternative if decay > 1). We also include trials where the first cue is tied, pitting the second cue against the last cue. Here, the Competing Theory's independent recency weight will dictate the choice, whereas the Advocated Theory's exponential decay (if < 1) dictates that the second cue will dominate the last cue.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The Competing Theory (Primacy-Dominant Anchoring) posits a structurally massive primacy weight (10 to 30) that will overwhelmingly dominate all other cues combined. Thus, whenever the first cue discriminates between the two options, the Competing Theory will almost always choose the option favored by the first cue, yielding an alignment rate close to 1.0 (minus epsilon noise). In contrast, the Advocated Theory (Validity-Weighted Evidence Accumulation with Normalized Attention Decay) uses a continuous decay parameter that frequently exceeds 1.0, meaning later cues will often overpower the first cue. By calculating the proportion of choices that align with the first cue on trials where it discriminates, we expect a very high value for the Competing Theory and a significantly lower value for the Advocated Theory.

    # Determine if the subject chose Option A (response == 0)

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The two theories represent extreme structural commitments: pi_19 enforces a massive, inescapable primacy anchor, while pi_21 assumes a continuous exponential attention decay over validities. Across the 40 experiments, we see a highly heterogeneous set of behavioral phenomena. In some experiments (e.g., Exp 34-39), subjects exhibit overwhelming primacy, choosing the option favored by the first cue over 85% of the time, which pi_19 captures perfectly but pi_21 fails to predict. In other experiments (e.g., Exp 31), subjects exhibit massive recency (aligning with the final cue over 84% of the time), which pi_19 completely fails to explain due to its structural primacy dominance, but pi_21 can accommodate if decay > 1. Meanwhile, in Exp 1, 4, 5, and 11, subjects exhibit behavior consistent with Tallying (unit-weight linear integration), largely ignoring both primacy and given validities, which neither theory naturally predicts without extreme parameterizations. Because neither theory dynamically adapts its strategy (Primacy, Recency, Tallying, or WADD) based on the dispersion of validities or the specific conflict structure of the environment, both fail to provide a task-invariant account. A fundamentally new theory is required that treats heuristic selection (e.g., TTB/Primacy vs. Tallying) as an adaptive process dependent on the environment's validity structure.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose an 'Adaptive Strategy Selection' theory. Instead of structurally enforcing primacy (pi_19) or continuous decay (pi_21), this theory posits that decision-makers dynamically select between distinct decision heuristics (e.g., Take-The-Best, Tallying, and WADD) based on the dispersion of the provided cue validities. If the validities are highly skewed (one cue is vastly more predictive), the model collapses into a single-cue heuristic (like Primacy or Recency, depending on which cue holds the maximum validity). If the validities are relatively flat or close to each other, the model shifts towards Tallying (unit-weight integration) because the cognitive effort of weighting is unjustified. This meta-learning or strategy-selection mechanism can elegantly switch between the diverse phenomena observed across the 40 experiments."
