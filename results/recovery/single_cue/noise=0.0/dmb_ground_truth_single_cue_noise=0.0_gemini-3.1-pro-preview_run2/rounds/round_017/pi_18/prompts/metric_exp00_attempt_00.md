# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.6, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.6]

**Trial pairs (n=7):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Serial Position Dual-Overweighting (Advocated Theory) from Primacy-Dominant Anchoring (Competing Theory), we exploit the structural constraints on their primacy and recency weights. The Competing Theory strictly enforces that the primacy weight (10-30) is significantly larger than the recency weight (0-9) and the middle cue validities, making the first cue an overwhelming anchor that almost always dictates choice. The Advocated Theory, however, allows both primacy and recency weights to vary in the same range (0-10), meaning recency can override primacy, or middle cues combined with recency can override primacy. We use a 5-feature design and include direct conflicts between the first and last cues. Most importantly, we include trials where the first cue favors one option while the last cue and all middle cues favor the alternative. The Competing Theory's massive primacy weight will often force it to still choose the option favored by the first cue, whereas the Advocated Theory can easily predict a strong preference for the alternative.

**Computed schedule:** 7 unique pairs × 13 reps = 91 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Serial Position Dual-Overweighting: Decision-makers evaluate options by integrating features, but due to memory and attention constraints at the sequence boundaries, both the first (primacy) and the last (recency) cues are assigned independent, disproportionately large weights. Unlike models that normalize attention or weights, these boundary weights are unnormalized, allowing them to independently dominate choice when necessary. Middle cues are weighted by their stated validities, scaled non-linearly. This mechanism captures both extreme primacy and extreme recency effects without the dampening effect of weight normalization.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.0, 5.0]
- primacy_weight: [0.0, 10.0]
- recency_weight: [0.0, 10.0]
- validities: validities

```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Primacy-Dominant Anchoring: Decision-makers use the first cue as a powerful anchor that overwhelmingly dominates the evaluation process. While the final cue may receive a secondary recency boost due to short-term memory, the primacy weight is structurally much larger than both the recency weight and the middle cue validities. This explicitly enforces a hierarchy where primacy is the primary driver of choice.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- primacy_weight: [10.0, 30.0]
- recency_weight: [0.0, 9.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 5.0]
- validities: validities

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

Because of this structural constraint, the first cue acts as an overwhelming anchor, and subjects simulated under this theory will almost always choose the option favored by the first cue. The Advocated Theory, however, allows primacy and recency weights to vary in the same range (0-10), meaning that combinations of recency and middle cues can easily override the first cue. By calculating the overall proportion of trials where the subject's choice aligns with the first cue, we can robustly separate the two models: the Competing Theory will predict a near-ceiling alignment rate, whereas the Advocated Theory will predict a significantly lower alignment rate."
