# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_8`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_8`).

Propose a new theory that integrates Tallying with a non-linear or rank-dependent weighting scheme. For instance, a 'Tallying with Salience-Biased Tie-Breaking' theory, or a 'Parallel Constraint Satisfaction' model where features interact. The new theory must explain why subjects strongly prefer options that win on lower-validity features when the tally is tied (Ex 1 & 2), yet still rely heavily on the top-validity feature when the tally is slightly unbalanced (Ex 13). This suggests that validities do not act as simple additive weights or strict lexicographic filters, but might dynamically shift attention or act as a penalty when top features are missing.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Non-Linear Validity Weighting: Decision-makers integrate evidence by weighting each discriminating feature non-linearly according to its validity. Rather than strictly using pure Tallying (equal weights) or Take-The-Best (lexicographic weights), individuals apply an exponential scaling factor (gamma) to the validities. A gamma near 0 recovers pure Tallying, a gamma of 1 recovers standard Weighted Additive (WADD) integration. By restricting gamma to a low range, the model maintains a strong baseline of pure Tallying while still permitting moderate non-linear scaling to break ties, without letting the top-validity features completely dominate unbalanced tallies.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Model expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Apply non-linear exponential scaling to validities
    w = val ** gamma
    
    # Only count features where one option strictly beats the other (like Tallying)
    a_wins = (a > b).astype(float)
    b_wins = (b > a).astype(float)
    
    score_a = np.sum(w * a_wins)
    score_b = np.sum(w * b_wins)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.0, 2.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, the parameter range for `gamma` has been restricted from [0.0, 10.0] to [0.0, 2.0]. The previous broad range heavily biased the model toward Take-The-Best behavior, causing it to overpredict WADD and TTB choices on experiments where humans show a strong preference for Tallying. By lowering the upper bound of gamma, the model can maintain a stronger baseline of pure Tallying (gamma near 0) while still allowing moderate non-linear scaling to break ties, ensuring that top-validity features do not completely dominate unbalanced tallies.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.6742 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.5397 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.5397.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory implements a non-linear validity weighting scheme, but its performance diverges heavily from human data on several critical experiments. In Experiments 2, 3, 4, and 13, humans show a strong preference for Tallying (relying on the number of winning features rather than just the top validities). However, the candidate model heavily overpredicts Weighted Additive (WADD) and Take-The-Best (TTB) aligned choices (e.g., predicting 0.7783 in Exp 3 where humans are at 0.1317, and 0.8316 in Exp 13 where humans are at 0.1832). This indicates the model is overly sensitive to validity differences.
Rationale: The parameter range for `gamma` [0.0, 10.0] is too broad and heavily biases the model toward TTB-like behavior, overwhelming the Tallying component. Restrict the `gamma` range to something much lower (e.g., [0.0, 2.0] or [0.0, 3.0]). This minor adjustment will allow the model to maintain a stronger baseline of pure Tallying (gamma near 0) while still permitting moderate non-linear scaling to break ties, without letting the top-validity features completely dominate unbalanced tallies.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.6742 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.5397 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The reduction of the `gamma` parameter range successfully improved the loss (from 0.6742 to 0.5397) by allowing the model to better approximate Tallying behavior in some experiments (e.g., Exp 2 match improved to 0.8367). However, the model still catastrophically fails on Experiments 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. In Exps 13 and 14, humans show a strong preference for the Tallying winner (real metric ~0.18), but the candidate predicts ~0.84, indicating it still heavily favors the Weighted Additive / Take-The-Best winner. The current implementation of `val ** gamma` compresses weights but fundamentally remains a WADD model, forcing a compromise that fails when pure Tallying is strongly preferred over validity differences.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The current mechanism fails to capture cases where a strict Tallying advantage overrides top-validity features, because it merely compresses weights rather than structurally prioritizing the tally. To better align with the Arbiter's recommendation of 'Tallying with Salience-Biased Tie-Breaking', modify the `predict` function to explicitly compute the pure Tallying score alongside the non-linear validity score (using `val ** gamma`). You can introduce a mixture parameter `alpha` in [0.0, 1.0] to linearly combine the pure Tallying score and the validity-weighted score, or implement a soft threshold where validity weights only dominate when the tally difference is small or zero. This will allow the model to strongly default to Tallying in unbalanced cases (Exps 13/14) while breaking ties using validities (Exps 1/2)."
