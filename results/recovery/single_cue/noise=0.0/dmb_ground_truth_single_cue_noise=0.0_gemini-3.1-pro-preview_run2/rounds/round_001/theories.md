# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) model: People evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their feature values, where the weights correspond directly to the subjective validities of each feature. Unlike Take The Best, which ignores lower-validity cues, and Tallying, which weights all cues equally, WADD integrates all available information in a compensatory manner. This allows a combination of several lower-validity cues to correctly overpower a single higher-validity cue.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, we replace the non-compensatory Take The Best theory with the compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. WADD computes a score for each option by weighting its features by their stated validities. This mechanism naturally explains the empirical results: in Experiment 1, it allows multiple lower-validity cues to outweigh a single highest-validity cue (resulting in low TTB alignment, matching the human data of 0.2467), and in Experiment 2, it aligns closely with Tallying behavior (matching the high Tallying alignment of 0.8444) while remaining sensitive to the exact validities, thus providing a principled integration of evidence.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a * val)
    score_b = np.sum(b * val)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Hybrid Tallying: Decision-makers primarily rely on a frugal Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features where one option dominates another. However, they are not completely blind to cue validities; they give a slight premium to the single most valid cue. This premium acts strictly as a tie-breaker or a soft modulator and is never large enough to overcome a strict difference in tallies, blending the robustness of Tallying with a minimal sensitivity to cue hierarchy.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the upper bound of the `premium` parameter is restricted from 3.0 to 0.99. This minimal edit ensures that the premium applied to the most valid cue acts strictly as a tie-breaker or a slight nudge. Because tally differences are integers ≥ 1, a premium < 1.0 can never override a strict tally majority. This restores the robust tallying behavior necessary to match the empirical direction in Experiments 3 and 4, while still allowing the top cue to softly modulate choices when tallies are tied.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `premium`: `[0.0, 0.99]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    premium = float(parameters["premium"])
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Pure tallying component
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    
    # Identify the most valid cue (stable sort to break ties by original index)
    top_cue = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")[0]
    
    # Premium for winning the most valid cue
    a_top = float(a[top_cue] > b[top_cue])
    b_top = float(b[top_cue] > a[top_cue])
