# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Replace the Weighted Additive model with a 'Hybrid Tallying' or 'Lexicographic Tallying' theory. While pure Tallying explains the bulk of the variance, a new theory could posit that decision-makers primarily tally features but use the highest-validity cue(s) to break ties or give a slight premium to the most valid cue before reverting to equal-weight tallying. This would maintain the robust counting behavior observed in Exps 1, 2, and 4, while potentially capturing the nuances missed in Exp 3.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Hybrid Tallying: Decision-makers primarily rely on a frugal Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features where one option dominates another. However, they are not completely blind to cue validities; they give a slight premium to the single most valid cue. This premium acts strictly as a tie-breaker or a soft modulator and is never large enough to overcome a strict difference in tallies, blending the robustness of Tallying with a minimal sensitivity to cue hierarchy.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Hybrid Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    premium = float(parameters["premium"])
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Pure tallying component
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    
    # Identify the most valid cue (stable sort to break ties by original index)
    top_cue = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")[0]
    
    # Premium for winning the most valid cue
    a_top = float(a[top_cue] > b[top_cue])
    b_top = float(b[top_cue] > a[top_cue])
    
    score_a = a_wins + premium * a_top
    score_b = b_wins + premium * b_top
    
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- premium: [0.0, 0.99]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, the upper bound of the `premium` parameter is restricted from 3.0 to 0.99. This minimal edit ensures that the premium applied to the most valid cue acts strictly as a tie-breaker or a slight nudge. Because tally differences are integers ≥ 1, a premium < 1.0 can never override a strict tally majority. This restores the robust tallying behavior necessary to match the empirical direction in Experiments 3 and 4, while still allowing the top cue to softly modulate choices when tallies are tied.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4219 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0793 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0793.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model implements the requested Hybrid Tallying mechanism and was accepted by the gate because it slightly improved the aggregate loss. However, it still fundamentally fails to capture the empirical behavior in Experiments 3 and 4, predicting the exact opposite direction of the human data. In Exp 3, WADD-alignment is 0.13 empirically (meaning humans strongly prefer the Tallying choice), but the model predicts 0.68. In Exp 4, the empirical difference in preference is +0.69 (again, strongly aligned with Tallying), but the model predicts -0.45. This reversal occurs because the `premium` parameter is allowed to be as large as 3.0, which allows the highest-validity cue to completely override a difference in tallies (acting effectively like a WADD model).
Rationale: To fix the directional failures in Exp 3 and Exp 4 while keeping the Hybrid Tallying mechanism intact, the top-cue premium must act strictly as a tie-breaker or a very slight nudge, rather than a dominant force. Restrict the `premium` parameter range to [0.0, 0.99]. This will ensure that the premium can never override a strict tally majority (since tally differences are integers ≥ 1), restoring the robust tallying behavior seen in the empirical data while still allowing the top cue to break ties or softly modulate probabilities.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4219 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0793 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate model implements the Hybrid Tallying mechanism with the restricted `premium` parameter range [0.0, 0.99], as suggested in the previous iteration. This adjustment has been highly successful. By ensuring the top-cue premium cannot override a strict tally majority, the model correctly captures the strong empirical preference for Tallying over WADD/TTB in Experiments 3 and 4 (Exp 3: 0.20 vs real 0.13; Exp 4: 0.62 vs real 0.69). It also maintains the excellent fit for Experiment 2 (0.85 vs real 0.84) and captures the generally low TTB alignment in Experiment 1 (0.12 vs real 0.25). The aggregate loss has dropped substantially to 0.0793, indicating a very strong fit across the board.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate perfectly balances the robust counting behavior of pure Tallying with a soft tie-breaking premium for the most valid cue, capturing the empirical patterns across all four experiments. The parameter constraints are working exactly as intended. The model is good enough to proceed."
