# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Weighted Additive (WADD) model: People evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their feature values, where the weights correspond directly to the subjective validities of each feature. Unlike Take The Best, which ignores lower-validity cues, and Tallying, which weights all cues equally, WADD integrates all available information in a compensatory manner. This allows a combination of several lower-validity cues to correctly overpower a single higher-validity cue.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a * val)
    score_b = np.sum(b * val)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This experiment is designed to strongly dissociate the Weighted Additive (WADD) model from the Tallying heuristic using a 5-feature binary choice task. WADD integrates all features by weighting them according to their validities, allowing a smaller number of highly valid cues to compensate for a larger number of less valid cues. Tallying, on the other hand, strictly counts the number of winning features for each option and ignores their validities. By setting a steep distribution of validities (e.g., two very high and three lower validities), we can create critical trials where one option is favored by WADD due to possessing the high-validity features, while the alternative is favored by Tallying because it possesses a greater total number of winning features. We also include trials where Tallying predicts a tie (equal number of winning features) but WADD predicts a distinct preference, as well as baseline trials where both models agree.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes the proportion of choices that align with the Weighted Additive (WADD) model on critical trials where WADD and Tallying make strictly opposite predictions. Specifically, it isolates trials where one option possesses the two highest-validity features while the other possesses the three lowest-validity features. WADD's compensatory nature allows the two high-validity features to outweigh the three low-validity ones, predicting choice for the former. Tallying simply counts the winning features and predicts choice for the latter. The metric will be close to 1 for data generated by WADD and close to 0 for data generated by Tallying, providing maximal discrimination.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.55, 0.5, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design specifically pits Tallying against the Weighted Additive (WADD) model by using five features with a steep distribution of validities (two high, three low). Tallying simply counts the number of features favoring each option, treating all cues equally regardless of validity. WADD, conversely, integrates validities to form a compensatory sum. The trial set includes pairs where a smaller number of high-validity cues competes against a larger number of low-validity cues (producing opposing choices), as well as trials where both options are supported by an equal number of cues (producing a Tallying tie) but WADD strongly favors the option with the higher-validity cues. This ensures a robust quantitative dissociation across different choice profiles.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes the difference in the probability of choosing Option B between Trial 1 and Trial 6. In Trial 1, Option B is supported by 3 low-validity features while Option A is supported by 2 high-validity features. Tallying simply counts the features, favoring B (3 vs 2), whereas WADD integrates validities, strongly favoring A (0.95+0.9=1.85 vs 0.55+0.5+0.5=1.55). In Trial 6, the options are perfectly mirrored, so Tallying favors A and WADD favors B. Consequently, Tallying will yield a large positive difference (high P(B) on Trial 1, low P(B) on Trial 6), while WADD will yield a large negative difference. This creates a maximal contrast between the two theories.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the experiments, Tallying (THEORY 2, pi_2) consistently outperforms the Weighted Additive model (THEORY 1, pi_3). In Experiments 1 and 2, which were specifically designed to dissociate the two models by pitting a small number of high-validity cues against a larger number of low-validity cues, the observed data overwhelmingly sided with Tallying. WADD predicted effects in the completely opposite direction to the observed data (e.g., in Exp 2, WADD predicted -0.62 while observed was 0.69, closely matching Tallying's 0.73). WADD's compensatory nature overestimates people's willingness or ability to integrate exact validities in this binary choice task. However, Tallying slightly underpredicts the observed metric in Experiment 3, suggesting there might be some residual effect of cue order or validity that pure Tallying misses. Given WADD's fundamental failure here, it should be entirely replaced.",

  "recommendation": "Replace the Weighted Additive model with a 'Hybrid Tallying' or 'Lexicographic Tallying' theory. While pure Tallying explains the bulk of the variance, a new theory could posit that decision-makers primarily tally features but use the highest-validity cue(s) to break ties or give a slight premium to the most valid cue before reverting to equal-weight tallying. This would maintain the robust counting behavior observed in Exps 1, 2, and 4, while potentially capturing the nuances missed in Exp 3."
