# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_4" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_4
Hybrid Tallying: Decision-makers primarily rely on a frugal Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features where one option dominates another. However, they are not completely blind to cue validities; they give a slight premium to the single most valid cue. This premium acts strictly as a tie-breaker or a soft modulator and is never large enough to overcome a strict difference in tallies, blending the robustness of Tallying with a minimal sensitivity to cue hierarchy.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_4)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.95, 0.8, 0.65, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To dissociate Hybrid Tallying from Pure Tallying, we must exploit the only condition where their predictions diverge: when the total number of winning features is tied. Pure Tallying predicts a 50/50 guess on any trial where both options win on an equal number of cues. Hybrid Tallying, however, applies a 'premium' strictly as a tie-breaker for the single most valid cue. Thus, on tally-tied trials where one option wins the highest-validity cue, Hybrid Tallying will predict a distinct preference for that option. We also include control trials where one option has a strict tally advantage but loses the most valid cue; because the premium is strictly less than 1, Hybrid Tallying and Pure Tallying will agree on these, confirming that the premium acts only as a soft modulator rather than a lexicographic rule.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times subjects choose the option that wins the most valid cue (feature 0) specifically on trials where the pure tally of feature wins is tied. Pure Tallying predicts a 50/50 guessing rate on these trials (metric ~ 0.5), while Hybrid Tallying predicts a systematic preference for the option winning the top cue (metric > 0.5). By isolating exactly the trials where the two theories diverge, we maximize the discriminative power of the metric.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Pure Tallying from Hybrid Tallying, we focus on the specific conditions where their predictions diverge. Pure Tallying predicts a strict 50/50 guess whenever the number of winning features is equal, completely ignoring cue validities. Hybrid Tallying, however, applies a 'premium' to the single most valid cue, predicting a preference for the option that wins this top cue even when the overall tally is tied. Furthermore, when one option wins the tally by exactly one cue but loses the top cue, Pure Tallying predicts a standard preference strength based on a score difference of 1, whereas Hybrid Tallying predicts a significantly attenuated preference (score difference of 1 - premium). This design includes tally ties with top-cue wins, narrow tally advantages opposing the top cue, and control trials where the top cue is tied, providing a comprehensive test of whether the top cue exerts any special influence over choices.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with the single most valid cue, strictly on trials where the overall tally is tied. Pure Tallying predicts a 50/50 guess on these trials since it ignores cue validities, resulting in an expected value of 0.5. Hybrid Tallying predicts a value significantly greater than 0.5 because it uses the top cue as a tie-breaker.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all experiments, Pure Tallying (Theory 2) consistently predicts the observed data better than Hybrid Tallying (Theory 1). Specifically, Experiments 1 and 2 isolated trials where the overall tally was tied but the most valid cue favored one option. Hybrid Tallying predicted a strong preference for the option favored by the top cue, whereas Pure Tallying predicted a 50/50 guess. The observed data (~0.485 and ~0.528) strongly aligned with Pure Tallying, indicating that subjects do not use the most valid cue as a tie-breaker. Furthermore, across Experiments 3-6, Pure Tallying matches the observed metrics very closely, confirming that subjects rely on a simple unweighted count of winning features. Theory 1's hypothesis of a 'premium' for the top cue is unsupported by the data.",

  "recommendation": "The Hybrid Tallying theory is degenerate because subjects do not exhibit the predicted top-cue tie-breaking behavior. Replace it with a canonical baseline theory to contrast against Pure Tallying. Good candidates would be a pure 'Take-The-Best' (TTB) theory (which assumes strict lexicographic choice based on cue validities) or a standard 'Weighted Additive' (WADD) theory (which assumes full compensatory integration of cue validities). Even if these models ultimately lose to Pure Tallying, they are standard benchmarks in the decision-making literature and will provide a much sharper contrast than the unsupported hybrid approach."
