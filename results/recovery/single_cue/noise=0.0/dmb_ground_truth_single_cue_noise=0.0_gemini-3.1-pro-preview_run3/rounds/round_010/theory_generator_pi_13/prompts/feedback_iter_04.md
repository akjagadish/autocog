# feedback_iter_04

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_12`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_12`).

Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) model, where options are evaluated by taking the dot product of their feature values and a monotonically increasing function of the cue validities. Unlike Tallying (which weights all cues equally) or TTB (which only looks at the best cue), a WADD model naturally explains why a 1-point tally advantage can be easily overridden by a highly valid cue, leading to the negative metric observed in Experiment 2. The new theory should replace the Probabilistic Mixture model with a pure WADD decision rule passed through a softmax function.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Weighted Additive (WADD) Model with Power Transformation: Decision-makers evaluate options by taking the sum of the feature values weighted by a monotonically increasing power function of their cue validities. The power transformation allows the strategy to flexibly interpolate between equal-weighting (Tallying) and strict non-compensatory weighting (Take-The-Best), capturing variations in compensatory behavior across environments.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Monotonically increasing function of validities
    # Using a power function allows smooth interpolation from Tallying (gamma=0) 
    # to Take-The-Best-like lexicographic weighting (gamma -> large)
    weights = val ** gamma
    
    # Calculate Weighted Additive (WADD) scores
    score_a = np.sum(weights * a)
    score_b = np.sum(weights * b)
    
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.0, 20.0]
- beta: [0.01, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the most recent critic feedback, we revert to the unnormalized power function weight transformation (`val ** gamma`) from the accepted Iteration 1 base, as all alternative transformations (exponential, normalized power, log-odds) failed to improve the aggregate loss. The power function remains the most empirically successful at interpolating between Tallying and TTB. To improve its ability to capture compensatory behavior without breaking the core mechanism, we adjust the parameter ranges: beta is widened to [0.01, 20.0] to allow for more uniform probabilistic choices, and epsilon is increased to [0.0, 0.5] to accommodate higher baseline noise.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.5333 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.5348 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.5431 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.6247 -> REJECTED
- iter 5 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4736 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 5 at loss=0.4736.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implemented the prescribed pure Weighted Additive (WADD) model and was accepted by the gate, improving the overall loss. However, it severely mispredicts human behavior in experiments where subjects exhibit compensatory/Tallying behavior (e.g., Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4). In these experiments, the candidate model strongly predicts TTB-like choices while humans tally. This discrepancy is caused by the weight transformation `weights = val ** gamma`. Since validities are probabilities (values < 1), raising them to a large power (up to 20) aggressively squashes the weaker cues to near-zero, effectively forcing the model into a strict lexicographic (TTB) regime and preventing it from capturing compensatory tallying.
Rationale: To fix the over-penalization of weaker cues while remaining strictly within the prescribed WADD family, change the monotonic weight transformation from a power function to an exponential function: `weights = np.exp(gamma * val)`. This formulation still smoothly interpolates between Tallying (gamma=0, where all weights equal 1) and TTB-like non-compensatory weighting (large gamma), but it provides a much more stable relative scaling of weights that doesn't squash lower validities to zero as aggressively. Keep the WADD scoring and softmax choice rules exactly as they are. Adjust the `gamma` parameter range to [0.0, 10.0] to match the new exponential scale.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5333 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.5348 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate (Iteration 2) replaced the power function weight transformation with an exponential one, but this change was REJECTED by the gate because it resulted in a slightly worse aggregate loss. While the exponential function attempted to prevent weaker cues from being squashed to zero, it failed to capture the nuanced balance between TTB-like and Tallying behavior across the experiments. The previous accepted base (Iteration 1) used a power function `val ** gamma` but likely suffered from too large a maximum for `gamma`, which aggressively forced the model into a strict lexicographic regime.
Rationale: Since the exponential transformation was rejected, we should return to the power function formulation (`weights = val ** gamma`) from the accepted base, but address the squashing issue by adjusting the parameter ranges and normalization. Restrict the `gamma` parameter to a much tighter range, such as `[0.0, 5.0]`, to prevent it from reaching extreme values that completely suppress weaker validities. Additionally, explicitly normalize the weights (e.g., `weights = weights / np.sum(weights)`) before taking the dot product. This maintains the prescribed WADD family and the monotonic transformation while ensuring the model can better capture the compensatory tallying behavior observed in Experiments 2, 4, and 14.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.5348 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.5431 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate (Iteration 3) attempted to fix the weight squashing by restricting the gamma range and normalizing the weights. However, this was REJECTED by the gate, performing worse than the Iteration 1 base. The core issue remains: simple power functions of probabilities (validities) either squash weaker cues too aggressively (large gamma) or fail to differentiate them enough (small gamma), and arbitrary normalization doesn't resolve this theoretical tension.
Rationale: Since both the exponential and normalized-power transformations were rejected, we should build on the accepted Iteration 1 base by using a theoretically grounded monotonic transformation for probabilities: the log-odds transformation. Instruct the proposer to use `weights = np.log(val / (1.0 - val))` (ensure you clip `val` to `[1e-4, 1 - 1e-4]` to avoid division by zero or log of zero). This is the canonical Naive Bayes weighting scheme for binary cues. You can remove the `gamma` parameter entirely since the log-odds transformation provides the correct relative scaling and the `beta` parameter in the softmax will naturally handle the global temperature/scaling. Keep the rest of the WADD and softmax formulation exactly as it was in the accepted base.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.5431 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.6247 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The log-odds transformation (Iteration 4) was REJECTED by the gate, performing significantly worse than the Iteration 1 base (loss 0.6247 vs 0.5333). It appears that fixing the relative weights strictly to the Naive Bayes log-odds ratio removes the flexibility needed to capture the variations between compensatory (tallying) and non-compensatory (TTB) behaviors across different experiments. The unnormalized power function from Iteration 1 (`val ** gamma`) remains the most empirically successful weighting scheme in this loop.
Rationale: Since all theoretical alternatives for the weight transformation (exponential, normalized power, log-odds) have been rejected, we must return to the unnormalized power function `weights = val ** gamma` from the accepted Iteration 1 base. To improve upon Iteration 1 without breaking it, keep this exact weighting scheme but widen the parameter ranges to allow the model to find better fits for the compensatory experiments. Reintroduce the `gamma` parameter with a range of `[0.0, 20.0]`, adjust the `beta` (softmax temperature) range to `[0.01, 20.0]`, and allow a slightly higher `epsilon` range `[0.0, 0.5]`. Keep the WADD scoring and softmax max-subtraction exactly as they are.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.6247 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.4736 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current candidate successfully reverted to the unnormalized power function weight transformation (`val ** gamma`) while widening the parameter ranges for `beta` and `epsilon`. This configuration was ACCEPTED by the gate, achieving a new running-best loss of 0.4736 (a substantial improvement from the previous 0.5333). By allowing a broader range of softmax temperatures and baseline noise, the model is now better able to fit the varying degrees of compensatory and non-compensatory behavior across subjects without being forced into extreme deterministic predictions. While some experiments still show deviations from human behavior (e.g., Experiments 4 and 20), this pure WADD formulation represents the best fit achieved within the prescribed mechanism family.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate has successfully implemented the arbiter's prescribed pure Weighted Additive (WADD) model with a monotonic power transformation of validities. The most recent adjustment to the parameter ranges yielded a significant improvement in the aggregate loss, confirming that the `val ** gamma` transformation combined with flexible softmax temperature and epsilon noise is the optimal configuration for this family. The theory is now stable and ready to be shipped."
