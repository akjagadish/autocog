# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To dissociate Take The Best (TTB) and Tallying, we use a 4-feature design where the validities are strictly ordered. The trials are constructed such that the single highest-validity discriminating cue points to one option, while the simple sum of winning features (the tally) points to the other option or results in a tie. TTB will reliably choose the option favored by the top discriminating cue, ignoring the sheer number of lower-validity cues, whereas Tallying will choose the option with more total feature wins, ignoring the validities entirely.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of trials where the subject's choice aligns perfectly with the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic. Under TTB, subjects will consistently choose the option favored by the first discriminating feature, yielding a metric value close to 1.0 (subject to response noise). Under Tallying, subjects count the total number of winning features. The experimental design specifically pits TTB against Tallying on all trials: half the trials lead Tallying to choose the exact opposite of TTB (0% agreement), and the other half lead Tallying to a tie (50% agreement through guessing). Thus, data generated by the Tallying model will yield a metric value around 0.25, creating a massive and highly stable gap between the two theories.

                break
        
        if ttb is not None:
            matches.append(1.0 if row['response'] == ttb else 0.0)
            
    if not matches:
        return 0.5
    return float(np.mean(matches))

- Predicted under pi_1 (simulated): 0.8696 (var=0.0065)
- Predicted under pi_2 (simulated): 0.3196 (var=0.0022)

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To strongly dissociate Tallying (advocated) from Take The Best (competing), we use a 5-feature design with strictly ordered validities. The trials are constructed so that the highest-validity discriminating cue points to one option, while the simple sum of winning features (the tally) points to the other option or results in a tie. TTB will reliably choose the option favored by the top discriminating cue, ignoring the sheer number of lower-validity cues, whereas Tallying will choose the option with more total feature wins, ignoring the validities entirely.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with the Tallying heuristic's deterministic prediction on trials where Tallying does not result in a tie. Given the experimental design, Tallying and Take The Best (TTB) make diametrically opposite predictions on all non-tie trials. Therefore, data generated by the Tallying model will yield a metric value close to 1.0 (modulo noise), whereas data generated by the TTB model will yield a metric value close to 0.0. This ensures maximal separation between the two theories.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across both experiments, Tallying (pi_2) provides a far better account of the observed data than Take The Best (pi_1). Experiment 1 pitted TTB against Tallying, and the observed TTB match rate was 0.1454, which is extremely far from TTB's prediction (~0.87) and much closer to Tallying's prediction (~0.32). Experiment 2 similarly showed an 80% match with Tallying on non-tie trials, whereas TTB predicted only 16%. TTB fundamentally fails because participants are clearly integrating information across multiple cues rather than stopping at the first discriminating cue. However, Tallying's prediction in Exp 1 (0.32) slightly overestimates the observed data (0.145), suggesting that when tallies tie, participants might not be purely guessing but relying on other cue combinations. Because pi_1 (TTB) is completely degenerate in this domain, it should be replaced with a compensatory theory.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory to replace TTB. WADD posits that decision-makers compute a globally integrated value for each option by summing all cue values weighted by their respective validities (or subjective transformations of those validities), and choose the option with the highest total score. Unlike Tallying (which weights all cues equally) and TTB (which is non-compensatory), WADD represents a fully compensatory, validity-sensitive integration process. This will provide a strong parametric baseline that can capture whether participants are sensitive to cue validities at all when tallying fails or ties."
