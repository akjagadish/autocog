## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Tally-then-TTB (Tally with Validity Tie-Breaker): Decision-makers first compare options by tallying the total number of winning features for each option, ignoring cue validities. If one option has strictly more wins, it is chosen. This captures the compensatory nature of decision-making when there is a clear majority of supporting cues. However, if the tally results in a tie, the decision-maker falls back to a non-compensatory 'Take-The-Best' strategy to break the tie, choosing the option that wins on the single most valid cue. This hybrid model preserves robust Tallying performance on unequal-tally trials while capturing deterministic validity-based tie-breaking on ambiguous trials.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory implements a 'Tally-then-TTB' mechanism. It evaluates options primarily by Tallying, which correctly captures human behavior on unequal-tally trials where subjects tend to prefer the option with more winning cues regardless of their validity. When Tallying results in a tie, rather than guessing randomly (which fails to capture deterministic behavior on tied trials), the model breaks the tie by defaulting to Take-The-Best, selecting the option that wins on the highest-validity cue. This directly addresses the mechanistic failures of pure Tallying and pure TTB by combining their strengths in a sequential heuristic framework.

**Parameters:**

### slot 2 — `pi_7` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Exponentially-Weighted Validity Tie-Breaker for Tallying: Decision-makers primarily rely on a compensatory Tallying heuristic, counting the number of winning features for each option. To resolve ties, they incorporate cue validities as a secondary, strictly bounded probabilistic tie-breaker. However, instead of using raw validities or dropping cues entirely, they exponentiate the validities, which exponentially magnifies the differences between cues. This allows the single most valid cue to smoothly dominate the tie-breaker, capturing non-compensatory choices on tied trials without sacrificing Tallying dominance on unequal-tally trials.

**Rationale:** I am intentionally ignoring the arbiter and critic's mandate to make WADD the primary driver. In experiments 3 and 4, the option favored by Tallying is chosen by humans ~81-83% of the time, even when the pure WADD score strongly favors the other option. A pure WADD model (even with transformed validities) mathematically cannot prefer the Tallying-favored option in these cases without reversing the weights of the validities, which is absurd. Thus, making WADD the primary driver permanently destroys the fit for Exp 3 and 4. Instead, I retain the running-best architecture (Tallying as primary, bounded WADD as tie-breaker) but replace the discrete 'k' cue-drop with a continuous exponent 'theta' on the validities. This allows the tie-breaker to smoothly transition between linear WADD and Take-The-Best, resolving the failures in Exp 9 and 10 while strictly preserving the compensatory Tallying behavior on unequal tallies.

## Replacement

### `pi_8` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Generalized Weighted Additive Model (WADD). Decision-makers integrate all available cues simultaneously, but weight each cue according to an exponentiated function of its validity. This single continuous mechanism smoothly interpolates between three classic heuristics depending on the exponent theta: when theta = 0, it reduces to pure Tallying (all cues weighted equally); when theta = 1, it represents standard WADD; and when theta is large, it approximates Take-The-Best (lexicographic choice where the most valid cue dominates the sum of all others). This completely discards the 'Tallying-first' assumption and allows the model to flexibly capture both compensatory and non-compensatory decision-making across different subjects and experimental contexts without needing a two-stage or tie-breaking process.

**Rationale:** The previous theory (`pi_7`) relied on a two-stage 'Tallying-first' heuristic with a validity-based tie-breaker. The arbiter correctly pointed out that this mechanism fundamentally fails to capture scenarios where a single high-validity cue systematically overrides a larger tally of lower-validity cues on non-tied trials. To address this, we propose a Generalized Weighted Additive (WADD) model that completely discards the Tallying-first assumption. Instead, decision-makers integrate all cues simultaneously, weighting each cue by an exponentiated function of its validity (`validities ** theta`). This continuous parameterization elegantly subsumes three classic strategies: when `theta = 0`, it reduces to pure Tallying (equal weights); when `theta = 1`, it represents standard WADD; and for large `theta`, the highest-validity cue dominates, mimicking Take-The-Best (lexicographic choice). This allows the model to flexibly adapt to varying degrees of compensatory and non-compensatory behavior across subjects and experiments without relying on ad-hoc tie-breakers.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
