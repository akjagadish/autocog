# Round 7 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Tally-then-TTB (Tally with Validity Tie-Breaker): Decision-makers first compare options by tallying the total number of winning features for each option, ignoring cue validities. If one option has strictly more wins, it is chosen. This captures the compensatory nature of decision-making when there is a clear majority of supporting cues. However, if the tally results in a tie, the decision-maker falls back to a non-compensatory 'Take-The-Best' strategy to break the tie, choosing the option that wins on the single most valid cue. This hybrid model preserves robust Tallying performance on unequal-tally trials while capturing deterministic validity-based tie-breaking on ambiguous trials.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory implements a 'Tally-then-TTB' mechanism. It evaluates options primarily by Tallying, which correctly captures human behavior on unequal-tally trials where subjects tend to prefer the option with more winning cues regardless of their validity. When Tallying results in a tie, rather than guessing randomly (which fails to capture deterministic behavior on tied trials), the model breaks the tie by defaulting to Take-The-Best, selecting the option that wins on the highest-validity cue. This directly addresses the mechanistic failures of pure Tallying and pure TTB by combining their strengths in a sequential heuristic framework.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Tallying phase: count strict feature-wise wins
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    
    score_a = a_wins
    score_b = b_wins
    
    # Tie-breaking phase: if tallies are equal, use TTB
    if a_wins == b_wins:
        cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")
        for idx in cue_order:
            if a[idx] > b[idx]:
                score_a += 1.0
                break
            elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
                score_b += 1.0
                break
                
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np

    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_9` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Rank-Based Threshold Tallying: Decision-makers do not integrate all available cues indiscriminately, nor do they rely on a single cue. Instead, they form a consideration set of the top-K most valid cues and apply a compensatory tallying heuristic strictly within this subset. If this primary tally yields a clear preference, they choose that option. If the high-validity cues result in a tie, decision-makers fall back to a secondary tally of the remaining low-validity cues to break the tie probabilistically. This captures the robust tallying behavior in most tasks while restricting integration to 'important' cues, explaining deviations in environments where unweighted tallying over all cues breaks down.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, we revert to the iteration 1 `top_k_prop` base, which successfully passed the accept gate. The only change is tightening the `fallback_weight` range from `[0.0, 0.99]` to `[0.0, 0.1]`. This ensures the secondary tally strictly acts as a tie-breaker without compressing primary score differences, which previously diluted the softmax probabilities and degraded fit on experiments where primary tallying is dominant.

**Parameters:**
  - `top_k_prop`: `[0.1, 1.0]`
  - `fallback_weight`: `[0.0, 0.1]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    n_features = len(val)
    
    top_k_prop = float(parameters["top_k_prop"])
    k = max(1, int(np.round(top_k_prop * n_features)))
    
    # Rank validities: lowest = 0, highest = n_features - 1
    ranks = np.argsort(np.argsort(val))
    primary_mask = ranks >= (n_features - k)

    # so its maximum contribution is strictly < 1.0, ensuring it acts only as a tie-breaker.

        sec_a = a_wins_secondary / num_secondary
        sec_b = b_wins_secondary / num_secondary

## Replacement

### `pi_10` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Strategy Selection (Mixture of Tallying and TTB based on Top Cue): Decision-makers probabilistically choose to apply either pure Tallying or pure Take-The-Best on any given trial. The probability of selecting TTB over Tallying depends strictly on the validity of the single best available cue, capturing the most salient environmental trigger for non-compensatory strategy use without overfitting to secondary validity distributions.

**Rationale:** Following the latest critic advice, the strategy selection mechanism is simplified to prevent overfitting across experiments. The dispersion feature (and its corresponding weight w_disp) has been completely removed. The probability of choosing TTB now depends exclusively on a base rate and the validity of the single best cue in the environment (top_val). The rest of the model, including the probabilistic Tallying and global lapse rate, reverts to the Iteration 1 base, maintaining the core Mixture of Tallying and TTB framework as initially requested.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta_tally`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `w_base`: `[-5.0, 5.0]`
  - `w_top`: `[-10.0, 10.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
