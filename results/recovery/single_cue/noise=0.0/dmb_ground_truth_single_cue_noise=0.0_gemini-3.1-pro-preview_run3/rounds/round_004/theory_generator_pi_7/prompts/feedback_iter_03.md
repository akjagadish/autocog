# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_6`).

Propose a 'Weighted Additive (WADD) with Cue-Drop' or a 'Strict WADD' theory. The current theories assume Tallying is the primary driver and validities are secondary. The data from Exp 7 and Exp 3 show that subjects are highly sensitive to cue validities, often allowing one or two top-validity cues to override a larger tally of lower-validity cues. A model that computes a straightforward weighted sum of the features using the provided validities (with a softmax decision rule) would naturally capture the preference for top cues in unequal tallies (Exp 7) while also naturally breaking ties in favor of the highest validity cue (Exp 1 and 2).


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Non-linear Weighted Additive (WADD) with Cue-Drop: Decision-makers evaluate options using a weighted additive sum of feature wins, but they dynamically scale the importance of cues. Instead of using raw validities, they apply a non-linear exponent (gamma) to the validities, and they may ignore cues beyond the top K (Cue-Drop). When gamma is small, cue weights equalize and the strategy resembles Tallying (capturing compensatory behavior). When gamma is large, the differences between validities are exponentially magnified, allowing the most valid cue to dominate multiple middling cues, capturing strong non-compensatory tie-breaking behavior.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    k = int(parameters["k"])
    
    a_wins = (a > b).astype(float)
    b_wins = (b > a).astype(float)
    
    # Cue-Drop: only consider top K validities
    k_actual = min(k, len(val))
    top_k_idx = np.argsort(-val)[:k_actual]
    
    # Non-linear scaling of validities to allow top cue to dominate (when gamma > 1)
    # or to equalize weights like Tallying (when gamma is near 0)
    weights = np.zeros_like(val)
    weights[top_k_idx] = val[top_k_idx] ** gamma
    
    score_a = np.sum(weights * a_wins)
    score_b = np.sum(weights * b_wins)
    
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.0, 15.0]
- k: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
I am fully implementing the critic's advice by returning to the prescribed Pure WADD family, but introducing a non-linear scaling exponent `gamma` on the validities. This resolves the previous iteration's rejection: raw validities fail on Exp 9 and 10 because they do not provide enough weight for a single top cue to overcome multiple middling cues. By raising the validities to the power of `gamma` (which can range up to 15.0), the top cue's weight can exponentially dominate the others, capturing the non-compensatory choices in Exp 9 and 10. Crucially, this model also retains the ability to fit Exp 3 and 4: if `gamma` approaches 0, the weights of all retained cues equalize to 1, perfectly recovering the Tallying heuristic. Thus, the model smoothly interpolates between Tallying and Take-The-Best within a strict WADD framework.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3029 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2811 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.5755 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.5710 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.2811.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model drifted from the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family. Instead of implementing the requested 'Weighted Additive (WADD) with Cue-Drop' or 'Strict WADD', the candidate implemented 'Soft Lexicographic Tallying', which uses a full WADD score as a bounded tie-breaker. This leads to failures on Exp 9 and Exp 10. In Exp 10, the tied tallies pit a single top cue (index 0) plus weak cues against several strong middling cues (indices 1, 2, 3). The full WADD score favors the middling cues, leading the model to predict the wrong choice (~62% for B), whereas humans overwhelmingly choose the option with the top cue (~85% for A, metric = 0.15).
Rationale: You must faithfully implement the arbiter's recommendation: a WADD model with Cue-Drop. Your current model fails on Exp 9 and 10 because a full WADD sum overvalues a large number of middling cues compared to a single top cue. To fix this and remain within the prescribed WADD family, implement 'Cue-Drop': compute the WADD score but ignore (zero out) cues beyond the top K validities (where K could be a free parameter, e.g., K in [1, 5]). By dropping lower-ranked cues, the WADD score will correctly favor the option with the highest validity cues, solving the failures in Exp 9 and 10 while adhering to the arbiter's mechanism family.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3029 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2811 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model explicitly rejected the arbiter's recommendation to use WADD (with or without Cue-Drop) as the primary decision mechanism, instead retaining Tallying as the primary driver and relegating Cue-Drop WADD to a tie-breaker. As a result, the model continues to fail on Exp 9 and Exp 10, where cue validities override simple tallies. In Exp 10, the observed metric is 0.1525, but the model predicts 0.5669. In Exp 9, the observed metric is 0.7361, but the model predicts 0.4646.
Rationale: You must faithfully implement the mechanism family prescribed by the arbiter: WADD with Cue-Drop must be the PRIMARY driver of the decision, not a bounded tie-breaker for Tallying. Calculate the WADD score for each option using only the top K validities (zeroing out the rest) and feed these scores directly into the softmax choice rule. Do not compute or add a Tallying score. To address your concerns about Exp 3 and 4, a WADD model with Cue-Drop can still capture Tallying-like behavior if K is tuned appropriately (e.g., K=3 or 4) alongside the softmax temperature. Please return to the prescribed family.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2811 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.5755 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The pure WADD with Cue-Drop model was REJECTED by the gate because it performed significantly worse than the previous Tallying-based baseline. By relying strictly on the raw provided validities as linear weights, the model fails to capture the heavily non-compensatory behavior seen in experiments like Exp 9 and Exp 10. In Exp 10, subjects overwhelmingly choose the option with the single most valid cue (cue 0) even when the alternative has multiple strong middling cues (cues 1, 2, and 3). Raw validities (e.g., 0.95 vs 0.85+0.65+0.55) lead a linear WADD model to incorrectly favor the middling cues. Thus, pure linear WADD fails to replicate the human preference for the top cue.
Rationale: Your previous attempt to implement the Arbiter's prescribed pure WADD with Cue-Drop was REJECTED by the gate because raw validities do not provide enough weight to the top cue to overcome multiple middling cues (causing failures on Exp 9 and 10). To fix this while strictly remaining within the prescribed pure WADD family, you must introduce a non-linear scaling parameter `gamma` (e.g., range `[0.1, 10.0]`) and compute the WADD weights as `weights = val_dropped ** gamma`. When `gamma > 1`, this will exponentially magnify the differences between validities, allowing the top cue to correctly dominate the WADD sum and capture the non-compensatory human choices in Exp 9 and 10. Keep the pure WADD structure and the Cue-Drop mechanism, but add this `gamma` transformation to the weights.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.5755 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.5710 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate's attempt to use a non-linear `gamma` exponent on validities was REJECTED by the gate. While `gamma > 1` helps fit the non-compensatory choices in Exp 9 and 10, it permanently destroys the model's ability to capture the Tallying-like behavior in Exp 2, 3, and 4. A single fixed `gamma` cannot simultaneously be near 0 (for Tallying) and highly positive (for Take-The-Best) across different experiments. The running-best base (iter 2) remains the accepted model, but we must still fulfill the arbiter's mandate to make WADD the primary driver rather than a mere tie-breaker for Tallying.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Your previous attempts to use pure validities or gamma-scaled validities failed because they couldn't balance Tallying and Take-The-Best behavior across experiments. To fix this while strictly remaining within the Arbiter's prescribed WADD family (and avoiding a fallback to Tallying), shift the validities by subtracting 0.5 (or 0.5 with a parameter) before applying them as weights: `weights = np.maximum(0, validities - 0.5)`. Cues with validities near 0.5 will naturally drop out or have near-zero weight, while highly valid cues will retain strong weight. This naturally allows a single WADD sum to exhibit Tallying when validities are moderately high (e.g., 0.85 vs 0.65+0.55) and Take-The-Best when a cue approaches 1.0. Implement this `weights = validities - 0.5` transformation within a pure WADD + Softmax model."
