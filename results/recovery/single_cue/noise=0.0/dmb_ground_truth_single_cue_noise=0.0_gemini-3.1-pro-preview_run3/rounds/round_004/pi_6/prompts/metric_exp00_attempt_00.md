# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To dissociate Validity-Biased Tallying (advocated) from Tally-then-TTB (competing), we focus on trials where the simple tally of features results in a tie. Both models first tally the cues and agree on unequal-tally trials. However, they resolve ties differently. Tally-then-TTB uses a non-compensatory tie-breaker, strictly choosing the option favored by the single highest-validity discriminating cue. In contrast, Validity-Biased Tallying breaks ties by comparing the sum of the validity ranks of all winning cues for each option. We designed key dissociation trials where one option wins on the single highest-validity cue, but the other option wins on multiple moderately high-validity cues such that its total sum of validity ranks is greater. On these trials, Tally-then-TTB will deterministically choose the option with the top cue, while Validity-Biased Tallying will probabilistically favor the option with the higher sum of validity ranks.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Validity-Biased Tallying: Decision-makers primarily rely on a compensatory tallying heuristic, but they do not treat all cues as perfectly equal. Instead, each winning cue contributes a base weight of 1 plus a small validity-dependent bonus based on the cue's rank. Because the validity bonus is strictly bounded, it cannot override a clear majority of cues, ensuring the model behaves like pure Tallying when one option has more wins. However, when the tallies are tied, these small, evenly spaced rank bonuses accumulate to probabilistically break the tie in favor of the option supported by higher-validity cues. This captures the slight empirical preference for more valid cues on tied trials without falling back to a deterministic, overly strong Take-The-Best strategy.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Tally-then-TTB (Tally with Validity Tie-Breaker): Decision-makers first compare options by tallying the total number of winning features for each option, ignoring cue validities. If one option has strictly more wins, it is chosen. This captures the compensatory nature of decision-making when there is a clear majority of supporting cues. However, if the tally results in a tie, the decision-maker falls back to a non-compensatory 'Take-The-Best' strategy to break the tie, choosing the option that wins on the single most valid cue. This hybrid model preserves robust Tallying performance on unequal-tally trials while capturing deterministic validity-based tie-breaking on ambiguous trials.

- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

    score_a = a_wins
    score_b = b_wins
    
    # Tie-breaking phase: if tallies are equal, use TTB
    if a_wins == b_wins:
        cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")
        for idx in cue_order:
            if a[idx] > b[idx]:
                score_a += 1.0
                break
            elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
                score_b += 1.0

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

On these trials, both options have an equal tally of winning cues. The Competing model (Tally-then-TTB) deterministically breaks the tie using the single highest validity cue (favoring the option with [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]). In contrast, the Advocated model sums the validity ranks, favoring the option with [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] because the combined weight of the moderately high validities outweighs the single top cue.
