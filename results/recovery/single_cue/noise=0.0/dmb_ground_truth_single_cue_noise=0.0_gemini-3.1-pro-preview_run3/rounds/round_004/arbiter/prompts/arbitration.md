# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Tally-then-TTB (Tally with Validity Tie-Breaker): Decision-makers first compare options by tallying the total number of winning features for each option, ignoring cue validities. If one option has strictly more wins, it is chosen. This captures the compensatory nature of decision-making when there is a clear majority of supporting cues. However, if the tally results in a tie, the decision-maker falls back to a non-compensatory 'Take-The-Best' strategy to break the tie, choosing the option that wins on the single most valid cue. This hybrid model preserves robust Tallying performance on unequal-tally trials while capturing deterministic validity-based tie-breaking on ambiguous trials.

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Validity-Biased Tallying: Decision-makers primarily rely on a compensatory tallying heuristic, but they do not treat all cues as perfectly equal. Instead, each winning cue contributes a base weight of 1 plus a small validity-dependent bonus based on the cue's rank. Because the validity bonus is strictly bounded, it cannot override a clear majority of cues, ensuring the model behaves like pure Tallying when one option has more wins. However, when the tallies are tied, these small, evenly spaced rank bonuses accumulate to probabilistically break the tie in favor of the option supported by higher-validity cues. This captures the slight empirical preference for more valid cues on tied trials without falling back to a deterministic, overly strong Take-The-Best strategy.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To dissociate Tally-then-TTB (advocated) from Validity-Biased Tallying (competing), we focus on trials where the simple tally of features results in a tie. Tally-then-TTB resolves ties by looking exclusively at the single highest-validity discriminating cue (Take-The-Best), ignoring the remaining cues. In contrast, Validity-Biased Tallying resolves ties by comparing the sum of validity ranks of all winning cues for each option. We designed key trials where one option wins on the single highest-validity cue, but the other option wins on multiple moderately high-validity cues such that its sum of validity ranks is greater. On these tied-tally trials, Tally-then-TTB will deterministically choose the option with the top cue, while Validity-Biased Tallying will probabilistically favor the option with the higher sum of validity ranks. We also include unequal-tally baseline trials where both models agree.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design includes 3 distinct trial types where the feature tally is tied (Trials 1, 2, and 3). On these specific trials, Option A always possesses the single highest-validity discriminating cue, but Option B possesses multiple moderately high-validity cues such that its sum of validity ranks is greater. Consequently, the advocated 'Tally-then-TTB' theory will deterministically break the tie in favor of Option A (using Take-The-Best), whereas the competing 'Validity-Biased Tallying' theory will probabilistically favor Option B (due to the higher accumulated validity rank bonus). By measuring the proportion of times Option A is chosen specifically on tied-tally trials, we create a metric where the advocated theory predicts a value near 1.0, while the competing theory predicts a value below 0.5.

    a_ratings = np.array(data['option_a_ratings'].tolist())
    b_ratings = np.array(data['option_b_ratings'].tolist())
    
    a_wins = np.sum(a_ratings > b_ratings, axis=1)
    b_wins = np.sum(b_ratings > a_ratings, axis=1)
    
    tied_mask = (a_wins == b_wins)
    
    if np.sum(tied_mask) == 0:
        return 0.5
        
    # Response is 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B
    # We calculate the proportion of times A was chosen on tied trials
    return float(np.mean(data['response'].values[tied_mask] == 0))

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_6)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To dissociate Validity-Biased Tallying (advocated) from Tally-then-TTB (competing), we focus on trials where the simple tally of features results in a tie. Both models first tally the cues and agree on unequal-tally trials. However, they resolve ties differently. Tally-then-TTB uses a non-compensatory tie-breaker, strictly choosing the option favored by the single highest-validity discriminating cue. In contrast, Validity-Biased Tallying breaks ties by comparing the sum of the validity ranks of all winning cues for each option. We designed key dissociation trials where one option wins on the single highest-validity cue, but the other option wins on multiple moderately high-validity cues such that its total sum of validity ranks is greater. On these trials, Tally-then-TTB will deterministically choose the option with the top cue, while Validity-Biased Tallying will probabilistically favor the option with the higher sum of validity ranks.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes the proportion of choices that align with the Validity-Biased Tallying (Advocated) model on the critical trials 1 and 2. On these trials, both options have an equal tally of winning cues. The Competing model (Tally-then-TTB) deterministically breaks the tie using the single highest validity cue (favoring the option with [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]). In contrast, the Advocated model sums the validity ranks, favoring the option with [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] because the combined weight of the moderately high validities outweighs the single top cue. This metric directly tracks the divergence in these tie-breaking mechanisms.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the 10 experiments, Tally-then-TTB (pi_5) captures tie-breaking behavior much better than Validity-Biased Tallying (pi_6), particularly in Experiments 1 and 2 where subjects overwhelmingly side with the single highest-validity cue when tallies are tied. However, both models fail significantly on Experiment 7. In Experiment 7, trials are designed such that a simple tally of the top 5 cues favors one option, but the absolute highest validity cues favor the other. The observed metric (0.17) indicates that subjects strongly prefer the option with the highest validity cues, directly violating the compensatory tallying assumption of pi_5. This suggests that subjects do not blindly tally cues and only use validities for tie-breaking; rather, they heavily weight the most valid cues, perhaps using a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy or a lexicographic strategy that only falls back to tallying when top cues are tied or ambiguous.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Weighted Additive (WADD) with Cue-Drop' or a 'Strict WADD' theory. The current theories assume Tallying is the primary driver and validities are secondary. The data from Exp 7 and Exp 3 show that subjects are highly sensitive to cue validities, often allowing one or two top-validity cues to override a larger tally of lower-validity cues. A model that computes a straightforward weighted sum of the features using the provided validities (with a softmax decision rule) would naturally capture the preference for top cues in unequal tallies (Exp 7) while also naturally breaking ties in favor of the highest validity cue (Exp 1 and 2)."
