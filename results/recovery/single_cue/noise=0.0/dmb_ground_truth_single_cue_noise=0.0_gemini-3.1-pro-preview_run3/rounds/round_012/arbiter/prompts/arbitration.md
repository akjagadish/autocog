# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_14") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_14" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Tally-then-TTB (Tally with Validity Tie-Breaker): Decision-makers first compare options by tallying the total number of winning features for each option, ignoring cue validities. If one option has strictly more wins, it is chosen. This captures the compensatory nature of decision-making when there is a clear majority of supporting cues. However, if the tally results in a tie, the decision-maker falls back to a non-compensatory 'Take-The-Best' strategy to break the tie, choosing the option that wins on the single most valid cue. This hybrid model preserves robust Tallying performance on unequal-tally trials while capturing deterministic validity-based tie-breaking on ambiguous trials.

## THEORY 2 — pi_14
Thresholded WADD (Tally-then-WADD) with Normalized Exponentiated Validities: Decision-makers primarily rely on a non-compensatory Tallying heuristic, counting the number of winning features. If the difference in tally scores exceeds a certain threshold (tau), they make a choice based strictly on this tally difference. If the tally difference is small or zero, they switch to a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. To capture strong non-compensatory choices on tied trials without destabilizing the softmax temperature, the cue validities are exponentiated and normalized. This allows the WADD component to become steep enough to mimic Take-The-Best (TTB) behavior when needed, bridging the gap between compensatory evaluation and strict non-compensatory tie-breaking.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Tally-then-TTB (advocated) from Thresholded WADD (competing), we exploit how each model scales tie-breaker determinism. In Tally-then-TTB, any tie broken by a single cue (whether it is the 1st or 2nd highest validity) yields a fixed score difference of 1.0, predicting identical choice determinism across different tie-breaker trials. In contrast, Thresholded WADD resolves ties using exponentiated validities. Because the exponentiated validity of the top cue is mathematically larger than that of the second cue, Thresholded WADD is structurally forced to predict higher determinism when the 1st cue breaks a tie compared to when the 2nd cue breaks a tie. By including both types of tied-tally trials, we can isolate this signature of equal vs. unequal determinism.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Measures the difference in the probability of choosing Option A between Trial 1 (where the tie is broken by the 1st cue) and Trial 2 (where the tie is broken by the 2nd cue). Tally-then-TTB adds exactly 1.0 to the score of the winning option regardless of which cue breaks the tie, predicting equal determinism (a metric value near 0). In contrast, Thresholded WADD uses exponentiated validities, so the score difference is mathematically larger when the 1st cue breaks the tie compared to when the 2nd cue does, predicting a strictly positive metric.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_14)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To dissociate Thresholded WADD (advocated) from Tally-then-TTB (competing), we exploit how the two theories resolve ties and near-ties in feature tallies. Tally-then-TTB strictly uses a non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) tie-breaker on tied-tally trials and strictly follows the tally on all unequal-tally trials. In contrast, Thresholded WADD uses a compensatory exponentiated-validity integration (WADD) on tied-tally trials, and can also apply this WADD evaluation to 1-point tally differences (if its threshold tau = 2). We include tied-tally trials where one option wins the single highest-validity cue but the other wins multiple moderately high-validity cues; Tally-then-TTB must choose the former, while Thresholded WADD can choose the latter. We also include unequal-tally trials where the minority of cues has the highest validity, allowing Thresholded WADD (if tau=2) to violate strict tallying, which Tally-then-TTB cannot do.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Calculates the proportion of times Option B is chosen in Trials 1, 2, and 3. Tally-then-TTB strongly predicts Option A for all these trials (either due to winning the highest validity cue in a tie, or having a strictly higher tally). In contrast, Thresholded WADD can frequently choose Option B on these trials because its compensatory WADD component evaluates the sum of multiple moderate cues higher than a single strong cue.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Theory 1 (pi_5) performs remarkably well across the majority of the 26 experiments, particularly in Experiments 2, 5, 6, 15, 16, 25, and 26, where its predictions closely match the observed data. Theory 2 (pi_14) consistently mispredicts these same experiments, often underestimating the strictness of the tallying phase. However, Theory 1 fails to capture the strongly negative metric values observed in Experiments 1, 13, and 24. For instance, in Experiment 1, the observed metric of -0.3583 indicates that subjects were much more deterministic when a tie was broken by the 2nd cue (after sharing the 1st cue) than when broken by the 1st cue outright. Neither theory predicts this. This suggests a 'cancellation' mechanism where subjects first ignore shared features before evaluating the options.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Feature Cancellation then Tally/WADD' theory. Subjects first edit the options by canceling out any features where both options have the same value (i.e., shared cues are ignored). After cancellation, they apply a Tallying heuristic on the remaining distinct features. If the remaining tallies are tied, they break the tie using a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) or Take-The-Best approach on the surviving features. This cancellation step can explain why trials with shared top cues (like Trial 2 in Exp 1) yield higher determinism: once the shared top cue is removed, the relative weight of the remaining cues shifts, leading to stronger preferences than when all cues are distinct."
