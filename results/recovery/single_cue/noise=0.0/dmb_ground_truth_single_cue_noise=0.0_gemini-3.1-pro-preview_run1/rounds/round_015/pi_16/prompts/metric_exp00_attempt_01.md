# metric_exp00_attempt_01

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.55, 0.85, 0.5, 0.9]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Context-Dependent Mixture of TTB and Tallying with Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking) from the Competing Theory (Rank-Dependent Continuous WADD), we exploit their differing dependencies on explicit validities versus spatial rank. The Competing Theory completely ignores explicit validities, relying entirely on spatial rank (an exponential decay favoring left-most features and a linear boost favoring right-most features). The Advocated Theory uses the explicit validities for its tie-breaking mechanism, strongly favoring features with lower validities. By using a non-monotonic validity array where low validities and high validities are interleaved, we create 'Tally Tie' trials where the Advocated Theory's inverse-validity tie-breaker makes deterministic predictions that conflict with the Competing Theory's rank-based weights. We also include 'Compensatory' trials to further differentiate the mixture model's TTB component from continuous rank-based WADD.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Context-Dependent Dual-Process Mixture of TTB and Tallying with Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking: Decision-makers rely on a mixture of Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying, but the mixture weight is dynamically determined by the environment. When cue validities are highly dispersed (measured by the standard deviation of the validities), subjects predominantly use TTB; when validities are similar, they rely on Tallying. When Tallying results in a tie, subjects resolve it using an inverse-validity weighting mechanism, heavily favoring options with positive features among the lower-validity (or more recently processed) cues.

**Parameters:**
- validities: validities
- disp_slope: [0.0, 100.0]
- disp_threshold: [0.0, 1.0]
- w_tie: [0.0, 0.95]
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- beta_tally: [0.1, 20.0]
- beta_ttb: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Rank-Dependent Continuous WADD with Additive Tie-Breaking: Decision-makers use a continuous Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy where subjective weights are determined by a combination of an exponential decay over cue rank (capturing TTB and Tallying) and a small additive linear boost for lower-ranked cues (capturing inverse-validity tie-breaking).

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [0.0, 10.0]
- delta: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
[0] rationale: This metric contrasts the two theories by evaluating choices on two critical 'Tally Tie' trials. In Trial 1, the Advocated Theory's inverse-validity tie-breaker favors option B, whereas the Competing Theory's rank-based continuous weights favor option A. In Trial 8, the Advocated Theory strongly favors option A due to the high inverse validity of the features it possesses, while the Competing Theory favors option B because it has the highest-ranked feature. The metric calculates the combined probability of choosing B in Trial 1 and A in Trial 8, yielding a high value for the Advocated Theory and a low value for the Competing Theory.

In Trial 2, both TTB and the Inverse-Validity Tie-Breaker favor option B, making the Advocated Theory strongly predict B. However, for the Competing Theory (Rank-Dependent WADD), a high delta parameter will cause it to favor option A because A's feature is further to the right. Similarly, in Trial 3, both TTB and the Tie-Breaker favor option A, while the Competing Theory with a high delta will favor option B. By summing the probability of choosing B in Trial 2 and A in Trial 3, we obtain a metric that will be consistently high for the Advocated Theory (low variance) and significantly lower for the Competing Theory."
