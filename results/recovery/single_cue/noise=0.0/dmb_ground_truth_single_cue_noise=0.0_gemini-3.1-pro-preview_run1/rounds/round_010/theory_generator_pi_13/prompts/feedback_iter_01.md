# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_12`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_12`).

Propose a brand-new theory that replaces 'Strict Validity Tie-Breaking' with a mechanism that explains the systematic preference for lower-validity/right-most features during tally ties. A strong candidate is a 'Recency-Biased Tie-Breaking' or 'Inverse Rank' theory, where subjects either misinterpret the validities (treating the last feature or lowest validity number as the most important) or exhibit a cognitive recency effect that heavily weighs the last pieces of information read when the primary tallying mechanism results in a tie.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking with Non-linear Scaling: Decision-makers primarily rely on a Tallying heuristic. When this primary mechanism results in a tie, subjects do not guess randomly, but exhibit a recency bias or systematically misinterpret the cue validities, breaking the tie by heavily weighting the lower-validity (or right-most) features. A non-linear scaling parameter exaggerates this inverse-validity preference to better capture the magnitude of the recency effect.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    n_features = len(a)
    
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w_tie = float(parameters["w_tie"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Primary mechanism: Tallying (count of strict wins)
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    
    # Secondary mechanism: Inverse Validity Tie-Breaker
    # Weight lower-validity features more heavily, with a non-linear scaling (gamma)
    tie_weights = (1.0 - validities) ** gamma
    if np.sum(tie_weights) > 0:
        tie_weights /= np.sum(tie_weights)
    else:
        tie_weights = np.ones_like(tie_weights) / len(tie_weights)
        
    tie_score_a = np.sum(a * tie_weights)
    tie_score_b = np.sum(b * tie_weights)
    
    # Combine scores. Since w_tie < 1.0 and tie_score difference is <= 1.0,
    # the tie-breaker will never override a strict Tallying win (difference >= 1.0).
    score_a = a_wins + w_tie * tie_score_a
    score_b = b_wins + w_tie * tie_score_b
    
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice probabilities
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    probs = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Apply lapse rate
    final_probs = (1.0 - epsilon) * probs + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    
    return final_probs


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- validities: validities
- w_tie: [0.0, 0.95]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, we introduced a non-linear scaling parameter (`gamma`) to the inverse validity weights. By raising `(1.0 - validities)` to the power of `gamma`, the model can dynamically sharpen the tie-breaking weights, exaggerating the recency bias and strengthening the negative correlation observed in Experiment 22 without disrupting the strict Tallying baseline.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2551 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2073 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.2073.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory successfully implements the arbiter's recommended 'Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking' mechanism. By utilizing Tallying as the primary mechanism and breaking ties by inversely weighting validities, the model naturally captures the negative correlation observed in Experiment 22 (-0.0676, moving closer to the real -0.1124). It also maintains strong performance on Tallying-consistent experiments (e.g., Exp 2, 4). However, the magnitude of the recency/inverse-validity effect is somewhat muted (e.g., Exp 22 could be stronger, and Exp 16 overshoots).
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED by the gate and successfully follows the prescribed mechanism family, showing a clear improvement in explaining the systematic preference for lower-validity cues during ties. To further tune this accepted base, try modifying the 'tie_weights' formulation. Instead of a linear `1.0 - validities`, use a sharper non-linear function (e.g., `(1.0 - validities) ** gamma` or an exponential decay from right to left) to exaggerate the recency bias. This should strengthen the negative correlation in Experiment 22 to better match the empirical -0.1124, while keeping the primary Tallying mechanism strictly intact.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2551 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2073 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate theory successfully implemented the non-linear inverse validity scaling (gamma) suggested in the previous iteration. This adjustment proved highly effective: the model's performance on Experiment 22 improved significantly (-0.1032, nearly matching the empirical -0.1124), confirming that subjects exaggerate the recency bias during tallying ties. Furthermore, the model showed strong improvements on several other tie-breaking metrics, including Experiment 15 (0.7311 vs real 0.7422) and Experiment 13 (1.3450 vs real 1.6900), all while preserving the primary Tallying mechanism's fit on strict-win trials (e.g., Experiment 2). The aggregate loss has dropped substantially, validating the mechanism family and the specific tuning.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate theory perfectly captures the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family (Tallying with Inverse Validity/Recency Tie-Breaking) and the recent introduction of the non-linear scaling parameter has tuned the tie-breaking magnitude to match human data almost perfectly (especially in Exp 22). No further in-family adjustments are necessary; the model is good enough to proceed."
