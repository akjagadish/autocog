# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_19" and "pi_16") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_19" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_16" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 2 — pi_16
Context-Dependent Dual-Process Mixture of TTB and Tallying with Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking: Decision-makers rely on a mixture of Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying, but the mixture weight is dynamically determined by the environment. When cue validities are highly dispersed (measured by the standard deviation of the validities), subjects predominantly use TTB; when validities are similar, they rely on Tallying. When Tallying results in a tie, subjects resolve it using an inverse-validity weighting mechanism, heavily favoring options with positive features among the lower-validity (or more recently processed) cues.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_19)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Soft Primacy-Biased Sequential Integration) from the Competing Theory (Context-Dependent Mixture of TTB and Tallying with Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking), we exploit their fundamentally different treatments of spatial position and explicit validities. The Advocated Theory relies entirely on left-to-right spatial position, employing a left-to-right TTB scan and a Primacy-Boosted WADD that heavily favors left-most features, completely ignoring explicit validities. The Competing Theory also uses left-to-right TTB, but its secondary mechanisms rely on Tallying and an Inverse Validity Tie-Breaker which explicitly favors features with lower validities. By assigning validities that monotonically decrease from left to right (highest on the left, lowest on the right), we align the Advocated Theory's spatial primacy bias with the highest validities. In 'Tally Tie' trials where Option A wins on the left and Option B wins on the right, both theories' TTB components favor A. However, the Advocated Theory's WADD component strongly reinforces A, whereas the Competing Theory's Inverse Validity Tie-Breaker strongly favors B (the lower validity features). We also include 'Compensatory' trials where Option A wins on the left-most feature but B wins on a greater number of right-most features, pitting the Advocated Theory's primacy bias against the Competing Theory's Tallying mechanism.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Across all trials in the experimental design, Option A is constructed to win on the left-most (highest validity) features, meaning the Take-The-Best (TTB) strategy will invariably choose Option A. The Advocated Theory combines TTB with a Primacy-Boosted WADD, which also heavily favors the left-most features, leading to an overwhelming preference for Option A across the board. In contrast, the Competing Theory combines TTB with Tallying and an Inverse-Validity Tie-Breaker. In all trials, Option B has either an equal or greater number of positive features compared to Option A, and its features are concentrated on the right (lower validities). Thus, the Tallying mechanism (and its tie-breaker) consistently favors Option B. As a result, the overall proportion of choosing Option B (response == 1) will be near zero under the Advocated Theory but significantly higher under the Competing Theory.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_16)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Context-Dependent Mixture of TTB and Tallying with Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking) from the Competing Theory (Soft Primacy-Biased Sequential Integration), we exploit their fundamentally different treatments of explicit validities versus spatial position. The Competing Theory uses an exponential left-to-right primacy decay for its WADD component and completely ignores explicit validities. The Advocated Theory uses explicit validities for both its mixture weight and its inverse-validity tie-breaker (which strongly favors lower-validity features). By setting validities to monotonically decrease from left to right, the Competing Theory's primacy bias aligns with the highest validities, while the Advocated Theory's inverse-validity tie-breaker strongly opposes it by favoring the right-most (lowest validity) features. We include 'Tally Tie' trials where TTB and Primacy WADD both favor the left-winning option, but the Inverse Validity tie-breaker favors the right-winning option, creating a sharp divergence. We also include 'Compensatory' trials where the left-most feature competes against multiple right-most features to further highlight the difference between Primacy WADD and pure Tallying.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes the difference in the probability of choosing option B between Trial 2 and Trial 5. In Trial 2, the Competing Theory's TTB and Primacy WADD both strongly favor option A, leading to a near-zero probability of choosing B. In Trial 5, both mechanisms strongly favor option B, leading to a near-one probability of choosing B. Therefore, the Competing Theory predicts a metric value close to -1.0. In contrast, the Advocated Theory's inverse-validity tie-breaker pulls the predictions in the exact opposite directions (favoring B in Trial 2 and A in Trial 5), which shrinks the difference considerably toward 0 or even makes it positive, providing a stark and stable contrast between the two models.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across both the targeted experiments and the historical ones, THEORY 2 (pi_16) consistently outperforms THEORY 1 (pi_19). In Experiment 1, pi_19 predicted a strong primacy bias leading to a low metric value (0.3485), but the observed value was high (0.7854), which pi_16 captured much better (0.6850). Similarly, in Experiment 2, pi_19 predicted a negative difference (-0.4200) while the observed difference was positive (0.6842), again better captured by pi_16 (0.2295). THEORY 1's core assumption of a left-to-right primacy-boosted compensatory mechanism completely ignoring explicit validities is falsified by the data. While THEORY 2 performs well, it still struggles on certain experiments (e.g., Exp 8 and Exp 33), suggesting room for a stronger competitor.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a new theory based on 'Validity-Weighted Evidence Accumulation'. Instead of a discrete mixture of Take-The-Best and Tallying, propose that decision-makers sequentially accumulate evidence across features, weighting each feature by its explicitly stated validity. If the accumulated evidence difference between the two options exceeds a dynamic or fixed internal threshold before all features are processed, the search terminates (mimicking TTB in high-dispersion environments). If all features are processed without crossing the threshold, the decision is based on the final accumulated sum (mimicking WADD or Tallying). This unified mechanism naturally adapts to different environments without needing ad-hoc inverse-validity tie-breakers or hard mixtures."
