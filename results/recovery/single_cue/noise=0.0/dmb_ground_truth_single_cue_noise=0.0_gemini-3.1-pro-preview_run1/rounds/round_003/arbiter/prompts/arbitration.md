# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
People make decisions by computing a weighted sum of the features for each option, but the weights are non-linear transformations of the provided cue validities. Specifically, subjects exponentiate the validities by a parameter gamma, which allows the strategy to continuously interpolate between Tallying (gamma = 0) and Take-The-Best (gamma -> infinity). The option with the higher total weighted score is preferred, subject to decision noise (softmax) and occasional lapses.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To dissociate the advocated WADD theory (with its flexible gamma parameter) from Tallying, we use 5 features with linearly decreasing validities. Tallying simply counts the number of winning features, ignoring validities. WADD computes a weighted sum where weights are validities exponentiated by gamma. We include 'compensatory' trials where one option wins on fewer but more valid features (e.g., the top 2) while the other wins on more but less valid features (e.g., the bottom 3). Tallying strictly predicts the latter, whereas WADD predicts the former for typical positive gamma values. We also include trials that result in a tie under Tallying but yield a strict preference under WADD, and trials that differentiate low gamma (close to Tallying) from high gamma (close to Take-The-Best) to fully exercise the advocated model's parameter space.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Under the Tallying heuristic, Trial 1 and Trial 2 both feature Option A winning on exactly 1 fewer feature than Option B (A wins 2 vs 3 in Trial 1; A wins 1 vs 2 in Trial 2). Thus, Tallying predicts an identical choice probability for Option A across both trials, leading to an expected difference of 0. Under the WADD model, the weighted sum of validities produces different relative preference strengths for these two trials, meaning the difference in choice probability for Option A should systematically deviate from 0.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Tallying from the Weighted Additive (WADD) model, we exploit their fundamentally different treatment of feature validities. Tallying completely ignores validities, relying only on the count of features where one option dominates another. WADD, conversely, weights features by their validities (exponentiated by a free parameter gamma). We use 5 features with a large spread in validities: two high-validity experts (0.95, 0.90) and three low-validity experts (0.60, 0.55, 0.50). The trial set includes 'compensatory' trials where one option wins on more features (favored by Tallying) but the competing option wins on fewer, much higher-validity features (favored by WADD). We also include 'tie' trials where both options win on the same number of features—causing Tallying to predict a uniform guess—but where the weighted sums differ, allowing WADD to predict a deterministic preference. Variations in these combinations target the varying gamma parameter of the WADD model.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
To reliably discriminate the theories regardless of the adversary's parameter distribution (particularly the sign of WADD's gamma), we measure the *determinism* of choices on 'tie' trials. Trials 2, 6, and 8 feature options that each win on exactly two features. Because Tallying completely ignores validities, it evaluates these pairs as perfect ties and guesses uniformly at random (50% probability), yielding an absolute deviation from 0.5 near zero (bounded only by binomial sampling noise). In contrast, WADD uses the validities to break these ties. Even if WADD's gamma parameter varies widely across subjects (causing some to consistently prefer A and others to consistently prefer B depending on whether gamma is positive or negative), any individual WADD subject will exhibit a strong, deterministic preference on each of these trial types. By calculating the absolute deviation from 0.5 per trial type *within* each subject and averaging, we obtain a metric that is robustly low for Tallying and robustly high for WADD, with minimal between-subject variance.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the 8 experiments, Tallying (THEORY 2) successfully captures human behavior in several cases (e.g., Experiments 4, 5, 6, and 7), but fails dramatically in Experiments 1 and 8. In Experiment 8, the metric specifically tests Take-The-Best (TTB) versus Tallying, and the observed value of 0.6650 indicates a strong preference for TTB-consistent choices on critical trials, which neither Tallying nor the Weighted Additive model (THEORY 1) captures. THEORY 1 (WADD with gamma) consistently fails to predict the correct direction or magnitude in Experiments 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8. The data suggests that humans are not strictly tallying nor using a smooth non-linear weighting, but rather employing a mixture of distinct heuristics\u2014specifically, Tallying and Take-The-Best.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a new theory based on a mixture of heuristics or strategy selection. The model should assume that subjects either use Take-The-Best (lexicographic rule based on the highest validity cue) or Tallying (counting the number of winning cues). The model should include a mixing parameter (e.g., probability of using TTB vs Tallying) to account for the fact that some subjects or trials rely heavily on the most valid cue (explaining Exp 8) while others rely on the sheer number of winning features (explaining Exps 4-6). This discrete mixture will better capture the bimodal nature of the observed data than a continuous weighting model."
