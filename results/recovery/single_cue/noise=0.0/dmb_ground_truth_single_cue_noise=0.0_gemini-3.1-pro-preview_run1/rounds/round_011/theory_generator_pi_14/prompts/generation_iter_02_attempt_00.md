# generation_iter_02_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_13`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Propose a brand-new theory that models decision-making as a probabilistic mixture of heuristics, specifically Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB). Instead of relying solely on Tallying with a contrived tie-breaker, the new theory should posit that subjects probabilistically choose between evaluating the options via Tallying and evaluating them via TTB (relying on the highest validity discriminating cue). This mixture approach can naturally explain the strong TTB adherence in Experiment 8, while still capturing the Tallying-dominated choices in other experiments.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.674)

**Description**
Decision-makers utilize a conditional mixture of three distinct heuristic strategies: Primacy-based Take-The-Best, Tallying, and a 'Top-Heavy Penalty' (Anti-Primacy) strategy. The Top-Heavy Penalty heavily penalizes options that rely on early, high-validity cues by using a linear index-based weight (starting from 1 instead of 0), preferring options whose positive features are shifted further to the right without entirely discounting the primary cue. When Tallying results in a tie, the reliance on this Top-Heavy Penalty is significantly boosted to act as a decisive tie-breaker, whereas in non-tie scenarios it provides a baseline balancing effect alongside Take-The-Best and Tallying.

### `pi_13` (overall score: 0.659)

**Description**
Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking with Non-linear Scaling: Decision-makers primarily rely on a Tallying heuristic. When this primary mechanism results in a tie, subjects do not guess randomly, but exhibit a recency bias or systematically misinterpret the cue validities, breaking the tie by heavily weighting the lower-validity (or right-most) features. A non-linear scaling parameter exaggerates this inverse-validity preference to better capture the magnitude of the recency effect.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.544)

**Description**
Tallying with Recency/Anti-Primacy Tie-Breaker: Decision-makers primarily use the Tallying heuristic, counting strict feature-wise wins to choose between options. However, when the win counts are tied, they do not guess uniformly; instead, they systematically break ties by favoring options whose positive features appear later in the sequence (a recency or anti-primacy bias). This is modeled by adding a secondary 'recency' score (a weighted sum with linearly increasing weights) to the tally score. The recency weight is constrained such that it can only determine the choice when the primary tallies are tied, preserving a strict Tallying baseline while robustly capturing tie-breaking behavior.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.4342 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.5024 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4342 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Decision-making in binary choice tasks is driven by a probabilistic mixture of two primary heuristics: Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB). On any given trial, a subject may evaluate the options by counting the number of winning features (Tallying) or by relying solely on the single highest-validity discriminating cue (TTB). When Tallying results in a tie, its choice probabilities become uniform, allowing the TTB preference to naturally act as a tie-breaker without requiring a separate, contrived tie-breaking mechanism. This mixture explains both the baseline reliance on Tallying and the strong TTB-consistent choices observed in tie-breaking scenarios.

- validities: validities
- p_ttb: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta_ttb: [0.1, 20.0]
- beta_tally: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory models decision-making as a probabilistic mixture of Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB). Instead of using contrived tie-breakers (like recency or inverse-validity weighting), it posits that subjects probabilistically choose between evaluating the options via Tallying and evaluating them via TTB (relying on the highest validity discriminating cue). This natural mixture allows TTB to break ties when Tallying is indifferent (since Tallying yields 50/50 probabilities in ties, the TTB preference dominates the mixture's output), explaining the strong TTB adherence in tie-breaking experiments like Experiment 8, while also capturing Tallying-dominated choices in other contexts.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory implements the arbiter's prescribed mixture of Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB) and was accepted by the gate (loss improved to 0.4342). However, by mixing the output probabilities directly, the model severely dilutes the baseline reliance on Tallying. For example, in Experiment 2 (which measures Tallying adherence), the candidate drops to 0.4983 (essentially random), whereas human data is 0.8178. Similarly, in Experiments 3 and 4, the model completely misses the strong Tallying-driven preferences. When Tallying is decisive but TTB disagrees, a high `p_ttb` pulls the mixed probability toward 0.5, leading to random choices instead of Tallying-consistent ones.
Rationale: To maintain the arbiter's prescribed Tallying/TTB mixture while fixing the dilution of Tallying in Experiments 2-4, adjust the mixture implementation. Instead of mixing the output probabilities of two independent softmaxes, mix the *evidence* (or logits) inside a single softmax: e.g., `z = beta * ((1 - w_ttb) * tally_evidence + w_ttb * ttb_evidence)`. Alternatively, if keeping the probabilistic mixture of policies, restrict the prior probability of using TTB (`p_ttb`) to a lower range like `[0.0, 0.4]` so that Tallying remains the dominant strategy overall, allowing TTB to shine primarily when Tallying produces a tie (0.5/0.5).

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4342 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.5024 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The evidence-mixing approach (iteration 2) was rejected by the gate, worsening the loss to 0.5024. It also drifted away from the arbiter's explicit instruction to 'probabilistically choose between evaluating the options via Tallying and evaluating them via TTB'. We must revert to the probabilistic mixture of strategies from iteration 1. However, we still need to solve the issue from iteration 1: Tallying must strongly dominate in non-tie scenarios (like Experiments 2, 3, and 4) while TTB acts as a tie-breaker (Experiment 8).
Rationale: The evidence-mixing approach was rejected by the gate and deviated from the arbiter's instruction to use a probabilistic choice between strategies. Building on the accepted base (iter 1), keep the probabilistic mixture of *probabilities* (i.e., `final_prob = (1 - p_ttb) * tally_prob + p_ttb * ttb_prob`). To prevent TTB from diluting Tallying in Exps 2-4, constrain the `p_ttb` parameter range to be strictly low (e.g., `[0.0, 0.3]`). Ensure that `tally_prob` is computed via a softmax over tallying scores (so it can be highly deterministic when there is a tally difference) and outputs exactly `[0.5, 0.5]` when the tally is tied. This allows the small `p_ttb` weight to act as a reliable tie-breaker in Exp 8 without overriding Tallying in Exp 2.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.5024 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.

This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "Decision-making in binary choice tasks is driven by a probabilistic mixture of two primary heuristics: Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB). On any given trial, a subject may evaluate the options by counting the number of winning features (Tallying) or by relying solely on the single highest-validity discriminating cue (TTB). When Tallying results in a tie, its choice probabilities become uniform, allowing the TTB preference to naturally act as a tie-breaker without requiring a separate, contrived tie-breaking mechanism. To maintain the strong dominance of Tallying observed in non-tie scenarios, the prior probability of using TTB is constrained to be relatively low.",

To address the issue of TTB diluting Tallying in non-tie scenarios (like Experiments 2, 3, and 4), the parameter range for `p_ttb` is constrained strictly to [0.0, 0.3]. This ensures that Tallying remains the dominant strategy overall, allowing TTB to shine primarily as a reliable tie-breaker when Tallying produces a 50/50 tie, without overriding the strict Tallying preferences in other experiments."
