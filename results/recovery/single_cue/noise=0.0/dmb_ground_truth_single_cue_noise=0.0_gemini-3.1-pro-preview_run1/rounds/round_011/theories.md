# Round 11 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_13` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking with Non-linear Scaling: Decision-makers primarily rely on a Tallying heuristic. When this primary mechanism results in a tie, subjects do not guess randomly, but exhibit a recency bias or systematically misinterpret the cue validities, breaking the tie by heavily weighting the lower-validity (or right-most) features. A non-linear scaling parameter exaggerates this inverse-validity preference to better capture the magnitude of the recency effect.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we introduced a non-linear scaling parameter (`gamma`) to the inverse validity weights. By raising `(1.0 - validities)` to the power of `gamma`, the model can dynamically sharpen the tie-breaking weights, exaggerating the recency bias and strengthening the negative correlation observed in Experiment 22 without disrupting the strict Tallying baseline.

**Parameters:**
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `w_tie`: `[0.0, 0.95]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 10.0]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

    # Primary mechanism: Tallying (count of strict wins)
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    
    # Secondary mechanism: Inverse Validity Tie-Breaker
    # Weight lower-validity features more heavily, with a non-linear scaling (gamma)
    tie_weights = (1.0 - validities) ** gamma
    if np.sum(tie_weights) > 0:
        tie_weights /= np.sum(tie_weights)
    else:
        tie_weights = np.ones_like(tie_weights) / len(tie_weights)
        
    tie_score_a = np.sum(a * tie_weights)
    tie_score_b = np.sum(b * tie_weights)
    
    # Combine scores. Since w_tie < 1.0 and tie_score difference is <= 1.0,
    # the tie-breaker will never override a strict Tallying win (difference >= 1.0).
    score_a = a_wins + w_tie * tie_score_a
    score_b = b_wins + w_tie * tie_score_b
    
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice probabilities
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    probs = e / np.sum(e)

    probs /= probs.sum()

```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_14` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Decision-making in binary choice tasks is driven by a probabilistic mixture of two primary heuristics: Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB). On any given trial, a subject may evaluate the options by counting the number of winning features (Tallying) or by relying solely on the single highest-validity discriminating cue (TTB). When Tallying results in a tie, its choice probabilities become uniform, allowing the TTB preference to naturally act as a tie-breaker without requiring a separate, contrived tie-breaking mechanism. To maintain the strong dominance of Tallying observed in non-tie scenarios, the prior probability of using TTB is constrained to be relatively low.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the most recent attempt to mix evidence (logits) was rejected, so we revert to the probabilistic mixture of strategies (mixing probabilities) from iteration 1. To address the issue of TTB diluting Tallying in non-tie scenarios (like Experiments 2, 3, and 4), the parameter range for `p_ttb` is constrained strictly to [0.0, 0.3]. This ensures that Tallying remains the dominant strategy overall, allowing TTB to shine primarily as a reliable tie-breaker when Tallying produces a 50/50 tie, without overriding the strict Tallying preferences in other experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `p_ttb`: `[0.0, 0.3]`
  - `beta_ttb`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `beta_tally`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

    p_ttb = float(parameters["p_ttb"])
    beta_ttb = float(parameters["beta_ttb"])
    beta_tally = float(parameters["beta_tally"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Take-The-Best (TTB): rely on the highest validity discriminating cue
    # Use stable sort to preserve left-to-right order for equal validities
    order = np.argsort(-validities, kind='stable')
    ttb_a, ttb_b = 0.0, 0.0
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            ttb_a = 1.0

        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            ttb_b = 1.0
