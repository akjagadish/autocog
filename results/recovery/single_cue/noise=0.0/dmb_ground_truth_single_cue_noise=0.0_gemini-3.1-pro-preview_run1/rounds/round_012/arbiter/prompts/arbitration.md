# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_13" and "pi_14") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_13" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_14" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_13
Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking with Non-linear Scaling: Decision-makers primarily rely on a Tallying heuristic. When this primary mechanism results in a tie, subjects do not guess randomly, but exhibit a recency bias or systematically misinterpret the cue validities, breaking the tie by heavily weighting the lower-validity (or right-most) features. A non-linear scaling parameter exaggerates this inverse-validity preference to better capture the magnitude of the recency effect.

## THEORY 2 — pi_14
Decision-making in binary choice tasks is driven by a probabilistic mixture of two primary heuristics: Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB). On any given trial, a subject may evaluate the options by counting the number of winning features (Tallying) or by relying solely on the single highest-validity discriminating cue (TTB). When Tallying results in a tie, its choice probabilities become uniform, allowing the TTB preference to naturally act as a tie-breaker without requiring a separate, contrived tie-breaking mechanism. To maintain the strong dominance of Tallying observed in non-tie scenarios, the prior probability of using TTB is constrained to be relatively low.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_13)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Tallying with an Inverse Validity Tie-Breaker) from the Competing Theory (a mixture of Tallying and Take-The-Best), we focus on 'Tally Tie' trials. Both models use Tallying as a primary mechanism and will generally agree when one option has strictly more feature-wise wins. However, when the feature-wise wins are tied, the Competing Theory relies on its TTB component, breaking the tie in favor of the option with the highest-validity winning cue. In contrast, the Advocated Theory employs an inverse validity tie-breaker, strongly favoring the option whose winning features have the lowest validities. By pairing high-validity wins against low-validity wins in tie scenarios, we create a stark qualitative divergence in predictions. We also include 'Compensatory' trials where the option with fewer wins is favored by the highest-validity cue; here, the Advocated Theory strictly follows Tallying, while the Competing Theory's TTB mixture component causes a measurable shift in choice probabilities.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric calculates the proportion of times subjects choose Option B on 'Tally Tie' trials (trials where both options have an equal number of positive features). On these specific trials, the Competing Theory relies on Take-The-Best (TTB) to break the tie, which consistently favors Option A because it has the single highest-validity cue. Conversely, the Advocated Theory uses an inverse validity tie-breaker that strongly weights the lower-validity cues, consistently favoring Option B. Therefore, the Advocated Theory predicts a metric value significantly above 0.5, while the Competing Theory predicts a value significantly below 0.5.

Source:
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # Calculate sum of ratings for A and B to identify tally tie trials
    sum_a = data['option_a_ratings'].apply(sum)
    sum_b = data['option_b_ratings'].apply(sum)
    
    # Filter for tie trials
    tie_mask = sum_a == sum_b
    tie_data = data[tie_mask]
    
    if len(tie_data) == 0:
        return 0.5
        
    # Return the proportion of times Option B was chosen on tie trials
    return float(tie_data['response'].mean())

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_14)

### DESIGN

  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (a mixture of Tallying and Take-The-Best) from the Competing Theory (Tallying with an Inverse Validity Tie-Breaker), we focus on two critical trial types: 'Tally Ties' and 'Compensatory' trials. In 'Tally Tie' trials, both options have an equal number of feature-wise wins. The Advocated Theory resolves these ties naturally via its TTB component, favoring the option that wins on the highest-validity discriminating cue. In stark contrast, the Competing Theory uses an inverse validity tie-breaker, strongly favoring the option that wins on the lowest-validity cues. By pitting high-validity wins against low-validity wins in tie scenarios, we create diametrically opposed predictions. Furthermore, we include 'Compensatory' trials where the option with fewer wins is favored by the highest-validity cue. Here, the Competing Theory strictly follows Tallying (as its tie-breaker cannot override a strict win), whereas the Advocated Theory's TTB mixture component induces a measurable shift in choice probabilities away from the pure Tallying prediction.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Focuses exclusively on 'Tally Tie' trials, where the two theories make diametrically opposed predictions. The Advocated Theory's Take-The-Best mechanism breaks ties using the highest-validity cue (which always favors option A in these specific ties), leading to a low proportion of B choices. In contrast, the Competing Theory's inverse validity tie-breaker heavily weights the lowest-validity cues (which favor option B), leading to a high proportion of B choices. Measuring the rate of B choices on these tie trials will thus yield a massive, stable gap between the two theories.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the 26 experiments, Theory 1 (pi_13: Tallying with Inverse Validity Tie-Breaking) consistently outperforms Theory 2 (pi_14: Mixture of Tallying and Take-The-Best). Specifically, in experiments designed to isolate tie-breaking behavior (e.g., Experiments 1, 2, 17, 24, 25, and 26), the observed data strongly contradicts the TTB prediction. Subjects systematically prefer options that win on the lower-validity (or more recently presented) features when Tallying results in a tie. Theory 1 captures this empirical pattern remarkably well, whereas Theory 2's reliance on TTB incorrectly predicts that ties will be broken in favor of the highest-validity cue. Because Theory 2's core assumption (TTB as a mixture component) fails to describe the qualitative direction of tie-breaking, it is fundamentally degenerate in this domain.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a brand-new theory that discards Take-The-Best. Instead, frame the decision process around 'Tallying with Attention Decay' or a 'Recency Heuristic'. The new theory should posit that while Tallying is the primary evaluation mechanism, cognitive load or working memory constraints cause subjects to forget or discount earlier (high-validity) features when ties occur, forcing them to rely disproportionately on the most recently processed (low-validity) features. This provides a more psychologically grounded mechanism for the inverse-validity/recency effect than a simple mathematical tie-breaker."
