# Round 6 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_8` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Decision-makers utilize a conditional mixture of three distinct heuristic strategies: Primacy-based Take-The-Best, Tallying, and a 'Top-Heavy Penalty' (Anti-Primacy) strategy. The Top-Heavy Penalty heavily penalizes options that rely on early, high-validity cues by using a linear index-based weight (starting from 1 instead of 0), preferring options whose positive features are shifted further to the right without entirely discounting the primary cue. When Tallying results in a tie, the reliance on this Top-Heavy Penalty is significantly boosted to act as a decisive tie-breaker, whereas in non-tie scenarios it provides a baseline balancing effect alongside Take-The-Best and Tallying.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's diagnosis, making THP a strict tie-breaker failed because it is needed for balancing non-tie scenarios. Reverting to the Iteration 5 base, the THP weight function was modified from `np.arange(n_features)` to `np.arange(1, n_features + 1, dtype=float)`. This minor adjustment ensures that the first feature still carries some positive weight, reducing THP's extreme opposition to Take-The-Best in Experiment 6, while preserving the relative right-shifted penalty required to resolve the tie scenarios in Experiments 9, 11, and 12.

### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.

        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]

## Replacement

### `pi_9` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Tallying with Recency/Anti-Primacy Tie-Breaker: Decision-makers primarily use the Tallying heuristic, counting strict feature-wise wins to choose between options. However, when the win counts are tied, they do not guess uniformly; instead, they systematically break ties by favoring options whose positive features appear later in the sequence (a recency or anti-primacy bias). This is modeled by adding a secondary 'recency' score (a weighted sum with linearly increasing weights) to the tally score. The recency weight is constrained such that it can only determine the choice when the primary tallies are tied, preserving a strict Tallying baseline while robustly capturing tie-breaking behavior.

**Rationale:** The arbiter diagnosed that the previous model (Theory 1) used a messy 3-way mixture that compromised the strict Tallying baseline, suggesting a simpler approach where Tallying is primary and a recency/anti-primacy score acts as a tie-breaker. This theory implements exactly that: the primary score is the strict tally of feature wins, and a secondary recency score (using linearly increasing weights for later features) is added. By normalizing the recency weights and bounding the recency parameter `w_recency` to [0.0, 0.99], we mathematically guarantee that a tally difference of 1 or more will always overpower the recency score. Thus, the recency score only dictates the choice probabilities when the tallies are tied, perfectly capturing the anti-primacy tie-breaking effect while retaining the robust baseline of Theory 2.

**Parameters:**
  - `w_recency`: `[0.0, 0.99]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

    # Linearly increasing weights for later features

    recency_b = np.sum(b * weights)
    
    # Combine scores. Since w_recency < 1 and max recency diff <= 1,
    # a tally difference of >= 1 will always dominate the recency difference,
    # preserving the strict Tallying baseline.
