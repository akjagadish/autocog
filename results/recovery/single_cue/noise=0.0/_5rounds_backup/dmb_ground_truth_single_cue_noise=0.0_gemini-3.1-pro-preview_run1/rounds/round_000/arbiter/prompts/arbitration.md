# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** These trials are designed to maximally dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from Tallying. TTB decides solely based on the highest-validity discriminating cue, whereas Tallying counts the total number of winning features while ignoring cue validities. In the critical trials, one option is superior on the single most valid cue, but the other option is superior on a larger number of less valid cues. TTB will deterministically choose the former, while Tallying will deterministically choose the latter. We also include trials where Tallying predicts a tie while TTB makes a decisive prediction.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with the Take The Best (TTB) prediction, specifically on trials where TTB and Tallying make conflicting deterministic predictions (i.e., where Tallying does not predict a tie). On these critical trials, TTB will choose the option with the highest validity discriminating cue, whereas Tallying will choose the option that wins on a larger number of lower-validity cues. Consequently, the metric will be near 1 for data generated by TTB and near 0 for data generated by Tallying, providing maximal discrimination.

        b = row['option_b_ratings']

        a_wins = sum(1 for x, y in zip(a, b) if x > y)
        b_wins = sum(1 for x, y in zip(a, b) if y > x)
        
        # Only consider trials where Tallying does not predict a tie
        if a_wins != b_wins:
            ttb_pred = None
            for i in range(len(a)):
                if a[i] > b[i]:
                    ttb_pred = 0
                    break
                elif b[i] > a[i]:
                    ttb_pred = 1
                    break
            
            if ttb_pred is not None:
                if resp == ttb_pred:
                    ttb_matches += 1
                total += 1
                
    return float(ttb_matches / total) if total > 0 else 0.5

### RESULTS
- Predicted under pi_1 (simulated): 0.8616 (var=0.0098)
- Predicted under pi_2 (simulated): 0.1291 (var=0.0066)
- Observed on real data: 0.1194 (var=0.0110)

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design strictly dissociates Tallying (which counts the total number of winning features regardless of their validities) from Take The Best (which relies exclusively on the highest-validity discriminating feature). The trials are constructed such that the option favored by the most valid discriminating cue is consistently outvoted by a larger number of less valid cues favoring the other option. This forces TTB and Tallying to make opposite predictions. We also include trials where Tallying predicts a tie (equal number of winning features) while TTB makes a deterministic prediction, further isolating the specific mechanisms of the two heuristics.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of trials where the subject's choice matches the prediction of the Tallying heuristic. The experimental design specifically pits Tallying against Take The Best (TTB) on 6 out of 8 trial types, meaning that under the Tallying theory, this proportion will be high (close to 1), while under TTB, it will be low (close to 0.25). This large mean difference combined with low within-subject variance across 96 trials will powerfully discriminate the two theories.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across both experiments, the observed data strongly contradict Theory 1 (Take The Best) and closely align with Theory 2 (Tallying). In Experiment 1, subjects chose the TTB-predicted option only 11.9% of the time on conflict trials, matching Tallying's prediction (12.9%) and rejecting TTB's prediction (86.2%). In Experiment 2, choices matched Tallying 76.1% of the time, again favoring Theory 2 over Theory 1. Since TTB's fundamental assumption\u2014non-compensatory, one-reason decision making\u2014fails to capture the data, tweaking its noise parameters will not resolve the discrepancy.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace Take The Best with a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. While Tallying performs well, it assumes all features are weighted equally. WADD posits that subjects integrate all available features (like Tallying) but weight them proportionally to their validities (unlike Tallying). This provides a compensatory mechanism where multiple lower-validity cues can outvote a single high-validity cue, naturally explaining the failure of TTB while potentially offering a better fit than pure equal-weight Tallying."
