# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a new theory that retains the core feature-counting mechanism of Tallying (which strongly drives behavior in Exps 3-6) but introduces a different tie-breaking or weighting mechanism to explain the severe drop to 0.145 in Experiment 2. Instead of a top-cue bonus, consider a mechanism where subjects might penalize options that rely too heavily on a single extreme cue, or a 'moderate-cue' bias where a cluster of medium-validity features is preferred over one high-validity feature when tallies are tied. The new theory must preserve the baseline 50/50 guessing on symmetric ties (Exp 1) while capturing the systematic anti-top-cue preference in Exp 2.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying: People primarily compare options by counting the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other (Tallying). However, rather than giving a bonus to the most valid cue, subjects exhibit an aversion to options that rely too heavily on a single extreme cue at the expense of moderate cues. When tallies are close or tied, this manifests as a penalty to the option endorsed by the most valid cue, reflecting a preference for a broader cluster of supporting evidence over a single strong piece of evidence. This preserves the dominance of Tallying for clear differences but explains the systematic anti-top-cue preference observed in tie-breaking scenarios.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    best_cue = np.argmax(val)
    
    w = float(parameters["w"])
    a_best_win = float(a[best_cue] > b[best_cue])

    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- w: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
The arbiter feedback highlights that standard Tallying overestimates the choice probability in Experiment 2 and completely misses the severe anti-top-cue preference in Experiment 6 (where subjects actively choose against the top cue when tallies are tied). To capture this, I introduced a 'Moderate-Cue Bias' via a penalty parameter `w` applied to the option that wins on the most extreme (highest validity) cue. Because `w` is bounded between 0 and 1, Tallying remains the dominant choice rule when one option clearly wins on count (e.g., Exp 1). However, when tallies are tied (as in Exp 6), the penalty forces the model to prefer the option supported by a cluster of moderate cues. Additionally, when the tally difference is small (e.g., 1), the penalty reduces the confidence in the Tallying winner, successfully lowering the predicted match rate in Experiment 2 from ~0.87 down closer to the observed 0.76.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1261 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1261.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying model is highly successful. It maintains the strong Tallying fits for Exps 1, 3, and 4, while significantly improving Exp 2 and drastically dropping the top-cue preference in Exp 6 (down from ~0.80 to 0.24, approaching the observed 0.145). However, this universal top-cue penalty over-corrects in Exp 5, dragging the top-cue choice rate on ties down to 0.21 (observed is 0.475, essentially neutral). Despite this tension between Exp 5 and Exp 6, the aggregate loss has reached a very strong new minimum.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate has successfully captured the core qualitative phenomena across the experiments within the prescribed mechanism family. The introduction of the top-cue penalty successfully resolves the anti-top-cue preference in Exp 6 without breaking the tallying dominance in Exps 1, 3, and 4. The loss is excellent, so we can confidently ship this theory."
