# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying: People primarily compare options by counting the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other (Tallying). However, rather than giving a bonus to the most valid cue, subjects exhibit an aversion to options that rely too heavily on a single extreme cue at the expense of moderate cues. When tallies are close or tied, this manifests as a penalty to the option endorsed by the most valid cue, reflecting a preference for a broader cluster of supporting evidence over a single strong piece of evidence. This preserves the dominance of Tallying for clear differences but explains the systematic anti-top-cue preference observed in tie-breaking scenarios.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=7):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design dissociates Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying from standard Tallying by manipulating the tally difference and the ownership of the most valid cue. While standard Tallying predicts choice probabilities based solely on the tally difference, Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying posits a penalty for the option winning the most valid cue (reflecting an aversion to relying on a single extreme cue over moderate ones). We include trials where the tally is tied but one option wins the most valid cue (forcing standard Tallying to guess, while the advocated model prefers the option winning on moderate cues), and trials where the tally winner either wins or loses the most valid cue (which modulates the advocated model's confidence but not standard Tallying's). A control trial with a tied most valid cue and tied tally ensures baseline agreement.

**Computed schedule:** 7 unique pairs × 13 reps = 91 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Calculates the proportion of trials where the tally is tied but the most valid cue is not, in which the subject chooses the option that *loses* the most valid cue. Standard Tallying predicts 0.5 (guessing), whereas Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying predicts a value greater than 0.5 because the option winning the most valid cue receives a penalty.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=7):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** This design isolates the specific penalty Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying applies to the most valid cue, differentiating it from standard Tallying. We use a 5-feature setup where the first feature is the most valid. We include trials where the tally is tied but one option wins the top cue (Standard Tallying predicts 50/50, while the Biased model penalizes the top-cue winner), trials where the tally winner also wins the top cue (Biased model predicts reduced confidence compared to Standard Tallying), and trials where the tally winner loses the top cue (Biased model predicts increased confidence). A control trial with a tied tally and tied top cue is included to show baseline agreement.

**Computed schedule:** 7 unique pairs × 13 reps = 91 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates trials where the overall feature tally is tied but one option is endorsed by the most valid cue (cue 0). Standard Tallying ignores cue weights and treats these trials as a pure tie, predicting a 50% choice rate for either option. Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying, however, actively penalizes the option endorsed by the most valid cue in favor of the option supported by more moderate cues. Therefore, the metric calculates the proportion of times the subject chooses the option that *loses* on the most valid cue. Standard Tallying will yield approximately 0.5, while Biased Tallying will yield a value significantly greater than 0.5.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across Experiments 1, 2, and 7, we see that when the overall tally is tied but one option wins the most valid cue, subjects choose the option endorsed by the top cue approximately 50% of the time (observed values ~0.48, ~0.46, ~0.47). This directly contradicts THEORY 1 (Moderate-Cue Biased Tallying), which posits a systematic penalty against the top cue and predicts subjects will strongly prefer the option supported by moderate cues (predicting ~0.77 and ~0.80 for anti-top-cue choices). THEORY 2 (Standard Tallying) correctly predicts that subjects will guess at chance (~0.50) when the tally is tied, ignoring cue validities completely. However, Experiment 8 shows an anomaly where subjects chose the top cue only 14.5% of the time in tied scenarios, which THEORY 1 captured better than THEORY 2. Nonetheless, the blanket top-cue penalty of THEORY 1 is definitively falsified by the majority of the experiments. We need a new theory to replace THEORY 1 that retains Tallying as the primary mechanism but introduces a tie-breaking mechanism or feature-pattern preference (e.g., favoring contiguous positive cues, or specific lower-tier cue combinations) that explains Exp 8 without predicting a top-cue penalty in Exps 1, 2, and 7.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a new theory that builds on Tallying but introduces a different secondary mechanism for tie-breaking. Instead of a blanket penalty for the most valid cue (which failed in Exps 1, 2, and 7), the tie-breaker should depend on structural patterns in the cues, such as a preference for contiguous features (e.g., 'streaks' of positive cues) or a recency effect (favoring options that win on the last few cues). This could explain the specific deviations seen in Exp 8 without disrupting the chance-level tie-breaking observed in the other experiments."
