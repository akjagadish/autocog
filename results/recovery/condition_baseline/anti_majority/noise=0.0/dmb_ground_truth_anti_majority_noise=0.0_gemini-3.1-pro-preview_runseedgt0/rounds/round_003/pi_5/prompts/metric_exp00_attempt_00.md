# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=10):** [0.95, 0.94, 0.93, 0.92, 0.91, 0.55, 0.54, 0.53, 0.52, 0.51]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To maximally dissociate the Advocated Theory (Reverse WADD) from the Competing Theory (Anti-majority ensemble), we design trials where Standard WADD strongly disagrees with both Take The Best (TTB) and Tallying. The Anti-majority model takes a majority vote of TTB, Tallying, and Standard WADD, and then deterministically flips it. By ensuring TTB and Tallying agree on an option (e.g., Option B), they form the majority, causing the Anti-majority model to predict the opposite (Option A). Meanwhile, because Standard WADD prefers Option A, the Reverse WADD model (which seeks to minimize the WADD score) will prefer Option B. This creates a stark, deterministic divergence in the choices predicted by the two models, completely separating a negative-utility WADD process from a contrarian heuristic ensemble.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Reverse Weighted Additive (Negative Utility) Theory: Subjects systematically interpret the features or validities as negative signals (such as costs, penalties, or negative reviews) rather than positive attributes. Consequently, they compute a standard Weighted Additive (WADD) score—the sum of feature values weighted by their respective validities—but aim to minimize this score. Choice behavior is modeled as a softmax over the negative WADD scores, offering an elegant, single-process cognitive explanation for the choice inversions observed across experiments. The noise parameters are tuned to reflect a higher degree of stochasticity observed in human data.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.01, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Reverse WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Compute standard WADD scores (sum of features weighted by validities)
    wadd_scores = stim @ validities
    
    # Reverse the scores to model negative utility (minimization)
    scores = -wadd_scores
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the negative WADD scores with numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People are modeled as running three classic heuristics in parallel — Take The Best (one-reason, top-validity cue), Tallying (count of feature-wise wins), and Weighted Additive (validity-weighted sum) — reading off the single option each heuristic deterministically prefers, and then leaning toward whichever option the majority of the three did NOT prefer. With three binary voters at least two always agree, so a majority option always exists; the model targets its complement. Response noise enters only at the final, ensemble level: a softmax over the binary "flipped-majority" score with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options. The individual heuristics contribute only their hard preference (their argmax) to the vote — they carry no internal noise — so beta and epsilon describe noise in the contrarian response itself, not in the constituent heuristics.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]

- validities: validities
- weights: [(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features

    # majority vote across the three binary votes and flip it: when at
    # least two models agree on an option, we target the other one.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- metric: Python source defining def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this metric; used when interpreting results.


## Response

```json
{
  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    import numpy as np\n    a_first = data['option_a_ratings'].apply(lambda x: x[0])\n    b_first = data['option_b_ratings'].apply(lambda x: x[0])\n    chosen_first = np.where(data['response'] == 0, a_first, b_first)\n    return float(np.mean(chosen_first))",
  "rationale": "In the experimental design, Reverse WADD systematically prefers the option that has a 1 on the most valid feature (feature index 0) across all trials, because it tries to minimize the overall WADD score and the competing options are constructed such that the one with a 0 on the first feature has a much higher sum of validities on the remaining features. In contrast, the Anti-majority model frequently votes against the option with a 1 on the first feature, because TTB and Tallying often form a majority that favors it, causing the contrarian ensemble to flip its choice to the option with a 0 on the first feature. Measuring the proportion of trials where the chosen option has a 1 on the first feature yields ~1.0 for Reverse WADD and ~0.25 for Anti-majority, strongly discriminating the two theories."
