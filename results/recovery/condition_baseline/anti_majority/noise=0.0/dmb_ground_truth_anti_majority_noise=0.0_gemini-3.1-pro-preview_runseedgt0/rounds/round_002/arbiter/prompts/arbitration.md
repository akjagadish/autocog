# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People are modeled as running three classic heuristics in parallel — Take The Best (one-reason, top-validity cue), Tallying (count of feature-wise wins), and Weighted Additive (validity-weighted sum) — reading off the single option each heuristic deterministically prefers, and then leaning toward whichever option the majority of the three did NOT prefer. With three binary voters at least two always agree, so a majority option always exists; the model targets its complement. Response noise enters only at the final, ensemble level: a softmax over the binary "flipped-majority" score with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options. The individual heuristics contribute only their hard preference (their argmax) to the vote — they carry no internal noise — so beta and epsilon describe noise in the contrarian response itself, not in the constituent heuristics.

## THEORY 2 — pi_4
People use a Soft Take-The-Best (Soft TTB) heuristic where they search through features in decreasing order of validity. The first discriminating feature determines the direction of the preference, but the strength of that preference is proportional to the validity of the feature that stopped the search. This means decisions made on the basis of highly valid cues are more deterministic, while decisions that fall back to lower-validity cues are noisier.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.98, 0.95, 0.6, 0.55, 0.51]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To maximally dissociate the Advocated Theory (Anti-majority ensemble) from the Competing Theory (Soft Take-The-Best), we design trials where the majority of the three standard heuristics (Take The Best, Tallying, Weighted Additive) agree on one option, causing the Anti-majority model to deterministically flip its preference to the opposite option. In these trials, Take The Best (TTB) is always part of the majority. Because Soft TTB always predicts the option favored by the highest-validity discriminating cue (the TTB choice), it will align with the majority. Consequently, the Anti-majority model will strongly predict the exact opposite of Soft TTB.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In the chosen experimental design, the majority of the three standard heuristics (TTB, Tallying, WADD) always favors the option that is superior on the most valid feature (feature 1). The Competing Theory (Soft TTB) will thus consistently favor the option with a 1 on feature 1. The Advocated Theory (Anti-majority), by definition, will consistently flip this preference and favor the option with a 0 on feature 1. This metric calculates the proportion of trials where the subject's chosen option has a 1 on the highest-validity feature. The Competing Theory expects this value to be high (>0.5), while the Advocated Theory expects it to be low (<0.5), resulting in a maximal and highly stable contrast.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_4)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.6]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To maximally dissociate the Advocated Theory (Soft Take-The-Best) from the Competing Theory (Anti-majority ensemble), we design trials where the majority of the three standard heuristics (TTB, Tallying, WADD) agree on an option. Because Soft TTB aligns with standard TTB's directional preference, it will consistently predict the majority-preferred option. The Anti-majority model, however, deterministically flips the majority decision, thus predicting the exact opposite. Furthermore, by varying which feature is the first to discriminate (highest validity, second highest, or third highest), we test Soft TTB's unique prediction that the determinism of the choice scales with the validity of the stopping feature, a quantitative nuance entirely absent in the Anti-majority model.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
By design, all trials in this experiment are constructed such that the three standard heuristics (TTB, Tallying, WADD) agree on the preferred option. Soft TTB will consistently lean toward this majority-preferred option (which is the TTB option), whereas the Anti-majority model deterministically flips the majority decision and leans toward the exact opposite. Measuring the proportion of choices that align with the TTB prediction will yield a value > 0.5 for Soft TTB and < 0.5 for the Anti-majority model, providing a massive, highly robust discrimination gap.

- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).

{
  "interpretation": "Across all six experiments, the observed data reveals a striking pattern: subjects systematically choose the option that standard decision heuristics (like TTB, Tallying, and WADD) would reject. Theory 1 (Anti-majority ensemble) captures this counter-intuitive behavior remarkably well, consistently predicting the low metric values in Experiments 1-4 and the specific reversals in Experiments 5 and 6. Theory 2 (Soft TTB), which assumes subjects follow a standard positive-validity search, completely fails to capture this systemic inversion, predicting metric values >0.8 when the observed values are <0.3. While Theory 1 fits the data well, its mechanism (running three heuristics and deliberately flipping the majority vote) is cognitively implausible and likely an ad-hoc proxy for a simpler underlying process. Theory 2 must be replaced with a more principled explanation for this inverted behavior.",

  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Reverse WADD' or 'Negative Utility' theory. The data strongly suggests subjects are interpreting the features or validities as negative signals (e.g., costs, golf scores, or negative reviews), leading them to systematically avoid the 'best' option under standard assumptions. Instead of an anti-majority ensemble, the new theory should model subjects as computing a standard Weighted Additive (WADD) score (sum of feature values weighted by validities) but aiming to minimize rather than maximize this score (i.e., picking the argmin, or applying a softmax over the negative WADD scores). This provides a more elegant, single-process cognitive explanation for the robust choice inversions seen across all experiments."
