# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. In this theory, decision-makers evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their features, where the weights correspond to the subjective validities of the cues. The choice is then made probabilistically via a softmax over the options' total weighted scores. This differs fundamentally from Take The Best because it integrates all available features rather than stopping at the first discriminating cue, and differs from Tallying because it scales each feature by its validity rather than weighting them all equally.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory with Non-Linear Cue Scaling: People evaluate multi-attribute options by computing an overall value for each option. This value is determined by taking a weighted sum of the option's features, where the weights correspond to the subjective validities of the respective cues scaled by a non-linear parameter. This scaling allows decision-makers to flexibly upweight highly valid cues (approaching a non-compensatory strategy) or downweight them (approaching an equal-weight tallying strategy). Decision-makers then choose probabilistically between the options by comparing these total weighted scores via a softmax function.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Non-linear scaling of validities
    weights = val ** gamma
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Calculate weighted sums for both options
    score_a = np.sum(weights * a)
    score_b = np.sum(weights * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities
- gamma: [0.1, 4.0]

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, I reduced the upper bound of the `gamma` parameter from 10.0 to 4.0. The previous iteration showed that while exponentiating the validities appropriately shifted the model from Tallying toward Take The Best behavior, it over-corrected by allowing gamma to grow too large, causing the strategy to become too non-compensatory. By tightening the gamma parameter range, we restrict the model from becoming excessively non-compensatory, allowing it to strike a better balance between TTB adherence and Tallying adherence.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3134 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1818 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1122 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.1122.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate WADD model integrates all features weighted by their raw validities. However, the simulation results show that it behaves too much like Tallying: it significantly overpredicts Tallying adherence in Experiment 2 (0.8689 vs human 0.6044) and underpredicts Take The Best (TTB) adherence in Experiment 1 (0.2273 vs human 0.4167). The raw validities do not provide enough contrast to capture the degree to which humans favor the most predictive cues.
Rationale: To fix the over-reliance on quantity (Tallying) and under-reliance on quality (TTB) within the prescribed WADD family, introduce a non-linear scaling parameter `gamma` that exponentiates the validities (`val ** gamma`) before computing the weighted sum. This allows the model to flexibly upweight the most valid cues (approaching TTB behavior when gamma > 1) or downweight them (approaching Tallying when gamma < 1). Add `gamma` to the parameters with a range like [0.1, 10.0] and update the predict function to use these transformed weights.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3134 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1818 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The introduction of the non-linear scaling parameter `gamma` successfully pushed the model in the right direction, significantly improving the overall loss (from 0.3134 to 0.1818). However, the model has slightly over-corrected: it now overpredicts Take The Best adherence in Experiment 1 (0.5840 vs human 0.4167) and underpredicts Tallying adherence in Experiment 2 (0.5128 vs human 0.6044). This indicates that while the mechanism is correct, the model is exploring values of `gamma` that are too high, making the strategy slightly too non-compensatory.
Rationale: The current WADD family with exponentiated validities is working well, but the parameter range for `gamma` allows it to grow too large, causing an overshoot in TTB adherence and an undershoot in Tallying adherence. Keep the exact same predict and policy functions, but tighten the upper bound of the `gamma` parameter range (e.g., reduce it from [0.1, 10.0] to [0.1, 3.0] or [0.1, 4.0]). This minor adjustment will constrain the model from becoming excessively non-compensatory, helping to dial in the exact balance between TTB and Tallying.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1818 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1122 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate model with `gamma` restricted to [0.1, 4.0] successfully improved the overall loss to 0.1122. It achieved an excellent fit for Take The Best adherence in Experiment 1 (0.4058 vs human 0.4167). However, by restricting `gamma`'s upper bound too much, the model now overpredicts Tallying adherence in Experiment 2 (0.7567 vs human 0.6044). In Iteration 2, a `gamma` upper bound of 10.0 yielded a Tallying adherence of 0.5128. Thus, the optimal upper bound for `gamma` lies between 4.0 and 10.0.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The current mechanism is highly effective, but the parameter range for `gamma` has been constrained slightly too much, leading to an over-reliance on Tallying in Experiment 2. To find the exact sweet spot between Iteration 2 (upper bound 10.0) and Iteration 3 (upper bound 4.0), adjust the `gamma` parameter range to [0.1, 6.0]. Keep all other predict and policy logic identical."
