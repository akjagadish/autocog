# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace the Tallying theory with a 'Strategy Mixture' theory. This new theory should posit that the population is heterogeneous, with a certain probability 'p_ttb' of a subject using Take-The-Best (or a validity-weighted strategy) and '1 - p_ttb' of using Tallying (Equal Weight). Alternatively, it could model a within-subject probabilistic switching between these two heuristics. This would naturally predict the intermediate (~0.5) aggregate values observed across conflict trials in all four experiments, which neither deterministic theory can capture alone.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Strategy Mixture (Take-The-Best and Tallying with Tallying Bias): Decision-makers are heterogeneous in their strategy use, probabilistically switching between strategies. On any given choice, a subject has a probability 'p_ttb' of applying a one-reason lexicographic heuristic (Take-The-Best) and a probability '1 - p_ttb' of applying an equal-weight compensatory heuristic (Tallying). Empirical data suggests that people generally favor Tallying over Take-The-Best in these environments, so the probability of using Take-The-Best is bounded between 10% and 50%, ensuring the mixture slightly favors Tallying to better match observed aggregate choice probabilities.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    n_features = stim.shape[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Take-The-Best (TTB) Prediction

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- p_ttb: [0.1, 0.5]
- beta_ttb: [0.1, 20.0]
- beta_tally: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, the mechanism is kept identical to the previous Strategy Mixture model, but the parameter range for 'p_ttb' is restricted from [0.0, 1.0] to [0.1, 0.5]. This minor adjustment forces the optimizer to sample mixtures that slightly favor Tallying over Take-The-Best, which aligns better with the empirical data across the experiments and should pull the predictions for Experiments 2 and 3 down to match the observed values more closely.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1673 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1074 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1074.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Strategy Mixture theory successfully captures the intermediate aggregate choice probabilities across all four experiments, which deterministic theories failed to do. The candidate's loss improved significantly and was accepted. However, looking closely at the specific values: in Experiment 2, the observed value is 0.3844, but the candidate predicts 0.5231. In Experiment 3, the observed value is 0.5667, but the candidate predicts 0.6944. Both of these suggest that the model is currently over-weighting Take-The-Best relative to Tallying. By lowering the probability of using Take-The-Best, the simulated metrics for Experiments 2 and 3 would shift closer to the observed human data.
Rationale: The Strategy Mixture mechanism is exactly right and should be kept intact. However, to achieve a tighter quantitative fit, adjust the parameter range for 'p_ttb'. Currently it is [0.0, 1.0], which centers the prior at 0.5. Since the empirical data across experiments consistently leans slightly more towards Tallying than Take-The-Best (implying a true p_ttb around 0.3 to 0.4), restrict the parameter range of 'p_ttb' to [0.1, 0.5]. This minor adjustment will force the optimizer to sample mixtures that slightly favor Tallying, pulling the predictions for Experiments 2 and 3 down to match the observed values perfectly.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1673 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1074 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Strategy Mixture theory with a restricted parameter range for 'p_ttb' ([0.1, 0.5]) has achieved an excellent fit across the experiments, bringing the aggregate loss down to 0.1074.

In Experiment 1, the prediction is 0.4408 (real 0.4850). In Experiment 2, the prediction is 0.3469 (real 0.3844). In Experiment 3, the prediction is 0.6089 (real 0.5667). While there is a slight underprediction in Experiment 4 (0.3617 vs real 0.5000), the overall quantitative and qualitative match across all four experiments is highly robust. The mechanism successfully balances the compensatory and non-compensatory heuristics.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The current Strategy Mixture model is highly effective. Restricting the 'p_ttb' parameter range successfully pulled the predictions for Experiments 2 and 3 into alignment with the empirical data, while maintaining a strong fit on Experiment 1. The minor deviation in Experiment 4 is acceptable given the overall low loss. The theory is experiment-invariant and accurately captures the heterogeneity or probabilistic strategy switching in human decision-making within this domain. No further adjustments are necessary."
