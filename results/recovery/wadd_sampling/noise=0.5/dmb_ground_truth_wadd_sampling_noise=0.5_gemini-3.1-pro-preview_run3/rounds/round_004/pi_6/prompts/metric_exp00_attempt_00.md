# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Validity-Biased Tallying from Pure Tallying with a very soft softmax, this design systematically manipulates the alignment between the pure tally (sum of features) and the Take-The-Best (TTB) highest-validity cue. The Competing theory (Pure Tallying) predicts choices driven entirely by the difference in the number of positive features, yielding a 50/50 split on tally ties and identical mild preferences for any given tally difference, regardless of validities. The Advocated theory (Validity-Biased Tallying) adds a lexicographic bonus for the option favored by the single highest-validity discriminating cue. By including trials where tallies are perfectly tied but the TTB cue favors one option, we can observe whether subjects show a 50/50 split or a validity-driven preference. Furthermore, by pitting the tally winner against the TTB winner (e.g., Option A wins the tally by 1, but Option B wins the highest validity cue), the Advocated theory predicts an attenuated or reversed preference compared to trials where tally and TTB align, whereas the Competing theory predicts identical preference strengths for the tally winner in both cases.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Validity-Biased Tallying: Decision-makers primarily rely on a simple Tallying (Equal Weights) heuristic, counting the number of positive features for each option. However, they retain a residual sensitivity to cue validity, applying a small lexicographic bonus to the option favored by the single most valid discriminating cue (Take-The-Best). This bonus serves to break ties when tallies are equal and slightly shifts preferences when tallies are close, implemented via a soft decision rule.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Tallying (Equal Weights) Theory with Very Soft Softmax: Decision-makers evaluate options by assigning equal weight to all features, simply counting the number of positive features for each option. However, their choices are not highly deterministic; they employ a 'very soft' decision rule where the difference in tallies yields only a mild preference (e.g., ~55/45 splits) rather than an overwhelming one, reflecting high levels of noise, uncertainty, or guessing in human decision-making in this domain.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.01, 0.5]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.1]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np

    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Equal Weights expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Tallying: count the number of positive features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a)
    score_b = np.sum(b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the tallies
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This metric isolates trials where the simple tally of positive features is perfectly tied between Option A and Option B. On these trials, the Competing Theory (Pure Tallying) predicts exactly a 50/50 split because the tally difference is zero. In contrast, the Advocated Theory (Validity-Biased Tallying) predicts that subjects will systematically break the tie in favor of the option favored by the single most valid cue (the Take-The-Best winner). By calculating the proportion of times subjects choose the TTB winner strictly on tally-tie trials, we cleanly separate the two theories: Competing should yield ~0.50, whereas Advocated should yield > 0.50."
