## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended heuristics (e.g. TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every heuristic agrees, and prefer pairs that dissociate single-feature focus from feature-summing strategies. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory with Log-Odds: People compare two options by considering all available features, weighting each feature by its subjective validity transformed into log-odds (Bayesian weights), and summing these weighted values to form an overall valuation for each option. This normative integration allows multiple lower-validity cues to jointly outweigh a single high-validity cue, while the non-linear log-odds transformation ensures that the highest-validity cues maintain sufficient relative influence. Response noise is modeled via a softmax over the WADD scores and an independent lapse rate.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Convert validities to log-odds weights for Bayesian integration.
    # Clip validities to avoid division by zero or log(0) for extreme values.
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 1e-5, 1.0 - 1e-5)
    weights = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Calculate Weighted Additive scores for both options
    score_a = np.sum(a * weights)
    score_b = np.sum(b * weights)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] The experiment is designed to pit Take The Best (TTB) against Tallying. TTB decides based solely on the highest-validity discriminating cue, ignoring the total number of cues each option wins. Tallying ignores cue validities and simply counts the number of cues each option wins. By creating option pairs where Option A wins on the highest-validity discriminating cue but Option B wins on a strictly greater number of lower-validity cues, the two models make completely opposite predictions. The trials systematically vary which cue is the highest discriminating cue and the margin of the tallying win.

[1] This design systematically pits Tallying against Take The Best (TTB) by creating choice pairs where the option favored by the highest-validity discriminating cue is opposed by the option that wins on a greater number of less valid cues. By varying the position of the highest discriminating cue and the margin of the tally, we can isolate whether choices are driven by single-cue frugality (TTB) or unweighted cue summation (Tallying).

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — heuristics that rely on validity-ordering re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) collapse WADD into a scaled Equal-Weight rule and make them indistinguishable by any decision.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended heuristics (TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) be dissociated; avoid trials where every heuristic agrees.

  "rationale": "This design pits Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory with Log-Odds against Tallying. WADD integrates features by weighting them with the log-odds of their validities, allowing a single highly valid cue to outweigh multiple less valid cues, or differentiating between options when the number of winning cues is tied. Tallying simply counts the number of features each option wins on, ignoring validities. By using validities [0.95, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55], we create strong disparities between log-odds weights. We include trials where one option wins on a single highly valid cue while the other wins on three less valid cues (WADD favors the former, Tallying favors the latter), as well as trials where both options win on an equal number of cues but with different validities (WADD strongly prefers one option, Tallying predicts a tie).",
