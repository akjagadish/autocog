# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
WADD / Take-The-Best Strategy Mixture Theory with Calibrated Determinism: Decision-makers probabilistically choose between a fully compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy and a non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) strategy on any given trial. By mixing WADD and TTB, the model captures both dominance violations (via WADD) and choice probability plateaus (via TTB). Independent inverse temperatures allow each strategy to scale properly. To match the high level of equivocation in human data across multiple experiments, the determinism of these strategies is strongly bounded, ensuring predictions remain appropriately probabilistic.

## THEORY 2 — pi_4
Strategy Mixture Theory with Decoupled Determinism: Decision-makers probabilistically choose between Tallying and Take-The-Best on any given trial. Because Tallying operates on raw integer count differences (which can be large) while TTB operates on binary 1/0 differences, the two heuristics have different intrinsic scales. To account for this, the model uses independent inverse temperatures (beta_tally and beta_ttb) for each strategy. This allows the decision process to independently calibrate the determinism of each heuristic, avoiding artificial scale distortions when balancing the two strategies via the mixture weight.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=7):** [0.95, 0.94, 0.93, 0.92, 0.52, 0.51, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design strictly dissociates the WADD/TTB mixture model from the Tallying/TTB mixture model by creating 'Double Agreement' trials where TTB and Tallying both favor the same option, but WADD strongly favors the opposite option. In the Tallying/TTB model, if both heuristics agree, the model must predict that option with high probability. The WADD/TTB mixture, however, can predict the opposite option if WADD's compensatory weighting of multiple high-validity cues outweighs the single highest-validity cue and the numerous low-validity cues. We use a set of 7 features with a specific validity distribution (four very high validities, three very low validities) to construct these critical dissociations, along with conflict and tie trials to calibrate the mixture weights and inverse temperatures.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates 'Double Agreement' trials where both TTB and Tallying strongly favor the same option, but WADD strongly favors the opposite option due to high-validity compensatory cues. Under the Tallying/TTB mixture theory, since both heuristics agree, the choice probability for this option will be extremely high. Under the WADD/TTB mixture theory, WADD pushes the decision in the opposite direction, significantly lowering the selection rate of the TTB/Tallying favored option.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_4)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=7):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design isolates the quantitative signature of the Strategy Mixture Theory with Decoupled Determinism (Tallying + TTB) and strictly dissociates it from the WADD + TTB mixture. The core logic relies on creating pairs of trials where the Tallying count difference and the TTB winner are held perfectly constant, but the WADD score difference flips direction. According to the advocated theory, because Tallying only computes raw count differences and ignores validities, it will produce the exact same choice probability for both trials in the pair. The WADD + TTB theory, however, must predict drastically different choice probabilities across the pair because the compensatory WADD score shifts from favoring Option A to favoring Option B. By comparing trials where Tallying and TTB predictions are fixed but WADD predictions vary, we can test whether subjects' behavior reflects pure counting (Tallying) or weighted summation (WADD).

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design consists of three pairs of trials. In each pair, the predictions of Tallying (count difference) and Take-The-Best (lexicographic winner) are held completely constant, but the Weighted Additive (WADD) score difference shifts from favoring Option B (or a tie) to favoring Option A. This metric calculates the difference in the rate of choosing Option A between the trials where WADD favors A (WADD difference > 0.1) and the trials where WADD favors B or ties (WADD difference < 0.1). Under the Tallying + TTB theory, since the inputs to both heuristics are identical across the sets, the expected metric is exactly 0. Under the WADD + TTB theory, the metric will be strongly positive because the compensatory WADD strategy pulls choices toward Option A in the first set and toward Option B in the second.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the suite of experiments, Theory 1 (WADD / TTB mixture, pi_5) significantly outperforms Theory 2 (Tallying / TTB mixture, pi_4). In Experiment 1, pi_4 drastically overestimates the choice proportion (0.84 vs observed 0.45) because it assumes Tallying and TTB agreement leads to deterministic choices, missing the compensatory pull of WADD. In Experiment 2, pi_4 predicts a zero or slightly negative effect because Tallying ignores cue weights, whereas human data shows a positive shift (0.0767) that pi_5 accurately captures (0.0717). pi_5 also provides much better fits on Experiments 5, 7, and 8. However, neither model perfectly captures the high equivocation in Experiments 3 and 6, suggesting that a simple probabilistic mixture of two distinct strategies (one fully compensatory, one non-compensatory) might still be missing a core psychological mechanism, such as non-linear transformation of the validities themselves.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Replace Theory 2 with a 'Rank-Dependent Evidence Accumulation' (or Rank-Weighted Additive) theory. Instead of a probabilistic mixture of two separate heuristics, propose that subjects use a single compensatory mechanism where the subjective weight of each feature is determined by its rank order of validity, rather than its raw validity score (e.g., weights decay exponentially by rank). This naturally bridges the gap between TTB (steep exponential decay) and Tallying (flat weights), allowing for compensatory trade-offs (like WADD) while naturally discounting lower-ranked cues. This single-process approach might better capture the intermediate choice probabilities across the experimental suite without relying on an arbitrary mixture parameter."
