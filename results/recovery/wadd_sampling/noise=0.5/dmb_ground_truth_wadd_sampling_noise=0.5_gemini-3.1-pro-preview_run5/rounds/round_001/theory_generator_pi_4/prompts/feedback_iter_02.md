# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace Tallying with a Strategy Mixture Theory. The new theory should propose that decision-makers probabilistically choose between two distinct heuristics: Tallying (counting winning features) and Take-The-Best (relying solely on the highest-validity discriminating feature). The model should include a mixture parameter (e.g., P_tally) that governs the probability of applying Tallying versus TTB on a given trial, alongside response noise. This will allow the model to capture the intermediate valid-cue preferences in Exps 1-2 and the partial Tallying matches in Exp 4, effectively bridging the gap between the two extremes.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Strategy Mixture Theory with Decoupled Determinism: Decision-makers probabilistically choose between Tallying and Take-The-Best on any given trial. Because Tallying operates on raw integer count differences (which can be large) while TTB operates on binary 1/0 differences, the two heuristics have different intrinsic scales. To account for this, the model uses independent inverse temperatures (beta_tally and beta_ttb) for each strategy. This allows the decision process to independently calibrate the determinism of each heuristic, avoiding artificial scale distortions when balancing the two strategies via the mixture weight.

- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- p_tally_weight: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, the previous failed attempt to artificially normalize Tallying scores has been reverted. Instead, the scale discrepancy between Tallying (which produces large integer differences) and Take-The-Best (which produces binary 1/0 differences) is resolved by decoupling the softmax temperatures. By introducing independent `beta_tally` and `beta_ttb` parameters, the model can naturally calibrate the determinism of each heuristic during parameter fitting. This minimal edit addresses the asymmetric noise issue while maintaining the core mixture mechanism that successfully lowered the loss in Iteration 1.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2409 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2841 -> REJECTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2018 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.2018.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Strategy Mixture Theory successfully integrates Tallying and Take-The-Best, yielding an accepted loss of 0.2409. It captures the intermediate nature of the behavior across experiments better than pure models. However, there are still discrepancies: it underpredicts the Tallying match in Exp 2 (0.54 vs 0.64) and overpredicts the TTB match in Exp 1 (0.49 vs 0.37) and Exp 4 (0.68 vs 0.53). A likely reason for this is that the shared `beta` parameter acts asymmetrically on the two strategies: TTB scores are [1.0, 0.0] (max difference of 1), while Tallying scores are raw counts (max difference up to 5). This makes the Tallying policy artificially much more deterministic than TTB for any given `beta`.
Rationale: The candidate correctly implements the prescribed mechanism family (Tallying + TTB mixture) and improved the loss. To further improve the fit within this family, normalize the Tallying scores (e.g., by dividing by the total number of features or by the total number of discriminating features) so that the maximum score difference is 1.0, matching the scale of the TTB scores. This will allow the shared `beta` parameter to control the determinism of both heuristics symmetrically, enabling `p_tally_weight` to more accurately balance the two strategies without scale distortion.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2409 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2841 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The previous attempt to normalize Tallying scores by the total number of features (iteration 2) was REJECTED by the gate. Shrinking the Tallying score differences made the Tallying predictions too noisy relative to TTB, which worsened the fit: Tallying match in Exp 2 dropped further from the human data (0.54 -> 0.48, real=0.64), and TTB match in Exp 1 increased further away from humans (0.49 -> 0.56, real=0.37). The accepted base (iteration 1) is still the best model, but it still underpredicts Tallying and overpredicts TTB.
Rationale: Since the normalization approach failed and was rejected, we should return to the unnormalized scores from Iteration 1 but fix the scale discrepancy by decoupling the temperature parameters. Introduce separate inverse temperatures: `beta_tally` and `beta_ttb` (both ranging from 0.1 to 20.0), replacing the single shared `beta`. This allows the model to independently calibrate the determinism of Tallying (which operates on integer count differences) and TTB (which operates on binary 1/0 differences), letting the parameter fitting naturally resolve the scale differences without artificial normalization.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2841 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2018 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The introduction of decoupled inverse temperatures (beta_tally and beta_ttb) successfully resolved the scale discrepancy between the Tallying and Take-The-Best heuristics. This change was accepted by the loop, driving the aggregate loss down from 0.2409 to 0.2018. The candidate now better approximates the empirical data across all experiments: the Tallying match in Exp 2 has increased toward the human data (from 0.54 to 0.56, real=0.64), and the overprediction of TTB in Exp 1 has been slightly mitigated compared to the rejected normalized attempt. While there are still some deviations (such as overpredicting the target pair F1 match in Exp 4), the model effectively bridges the gap between pure Tallying and pure TTB, faithfully instantiating the arbiter's prescribed Strategy Mixture family.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate has successfully implemented the Strategy Mixture Theory with decoupled temperatures, yielding a substantial improvement in loss. The mechanism naturally calibrates the determinism of the two distinct heuristics without artificial scaling distortions. Since the candidate aligns perfectly with the arbiter's recommendation and provides a strong fit to the data, it should be kept as the new baseline."
