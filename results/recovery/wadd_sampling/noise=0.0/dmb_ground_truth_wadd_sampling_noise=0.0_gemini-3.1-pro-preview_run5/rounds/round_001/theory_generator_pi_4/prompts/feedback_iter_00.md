# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Propose a new theory that incorporates both the simplicity of heuristics and the sensitivity to cue validities. For instance, a 'Validity-Thresholded Tallying' theory where subjects only tally features whose validities exceed a subjective threshold, or a 'Sequential Sampling' model where features are sampled with probabilities proportional to their validities until a confidence bound is reached. This would provide a stronger, bounded-rationality competitor to the fully compensatory Weighted Additive model.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Validity-Thresholded Tallying: Decision-makers simplify choices by ignoring cues with low validities and applying a simple tallying heuristic to the remaining high-validity cues. A subjective threshold determines which cues are considered reliable enough to use. For the included cues, the decision-maker counts how many times each option has a higher feature value than the other. The option with more wins among the thresholded cues is chosen. This boundedly rational strategy combines the frugality and robustness of tallying with the validity-sensitivity of weighted additive models, effectively breaking ties in favor of options that excel on more valid cues without requiring complex mental arithmetic.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Thresholded Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != stim.shape[1]:
        raise ValueError(f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {stim.shape[1]}.")
        
    tau = float(parameters["tau"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Identify which cues meet the subjective validity threshold
    valid_mask = val >= tau
    
    if not np.any(valid_mask):
        # If no cues are reliable enough, the decision-maker has no preference
        scores = np.zeros(2)
    else:
        # Tally wins only on the included cues
        a_filtered = stim[0, valid_mask]
        b_filtered = stim[1, valid_mask]
        
        a_wins = float(np.sum(a_filtered > b_filtered))
        b_wins = float(np.sum(b_filtered > a_filtered))
        
        scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
        
    # Softmax over the tally scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- tau: [0.5, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory implements 'Validity-Thresholded Tallying'. Standard Tallying fails because it treats all cues equally, leading to exact ties when options have the same number of wins, even if one option's wins are on much higher-validity cues. Take The Best fails because it is too extreme, relying only on a single cue and ignoring the rest. WADD performs well but assumes fully compensatory weighting which is cognitively demanding. By introducing a subjective validity threshold, this model filters out unreliable cues and tallies only the reliable ones. This allows the model to naturally break ties in favor of options that win on higher-validity cues (since lower-validity cues are excluded from the tally), capturing the human behavior observed in the experiments while maintaining the psychological plausibility and simplicity of a counting heuristic.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2937 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2937.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Validity-Thresholded Tallying model is a strong step in the right direction and was accepted by the loop. It successfully bridges the gap between Tallying and Take-The-Best (TTB) by dropping low-validity cues. However, looking at the fit across experiments, the candidate is currently too 'TTB-like' and not enough 'Tallying-like'. In Experiment 1 (which measures TTB matches), the model predicts 0.49 vs the human 0.33. In Experiment 2 (which measures Tallying matches when TTB and Tallying disagree), the model predicts 0.53 vs the human 0.74. This indicates that the threshold parameter `tau` is generally too high, filtering out too many cues and preventing the model from utilizing the tallying mechanism over a broader set of features.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate was accepted, but the fit can be improved by adjusting the parameter ranges. The current range for `tau` is [0.5, 1.0]. Because experimental validities often span from 0.55 to 0.95, this range forces the model to ignore a large portion of the cues on almost every trial, making it behave too much like TTB. Expand the `tau` range to allow lower thresholds (e.g., [0.0, 1.0] or [0.2, 0.9]) so the model can include more cues in its tally, which will help it capture the high Tallying-agreement observed in Experiment 2 and lower the excessive TTB-agreement in Experiment 1. Keep the core mechanism identical."
