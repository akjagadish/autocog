# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Propose a new 'Hybrid Cardinal-Rank Weighting' theory or a 'Strategy Selection' theory. Decision-makers might not rely purely on cardinal validities or pure ordinal ranks. Instead, they might use weights that are a function of both the cardinal validity and its ordinal rank (e.g., scaling cardinal validities by a rank-based discount factor), or they may engage in strategy selection where a mixture of compensatory WADD and non-compensatory/rank-based heuristics are used across the population. This new theory should capture the strict drop-offs seen in Exps 1, 2, and 4, while preserving the compensatory thresholding behavior that perfectly matched Exp 6.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Strategy Selection (WADD and TTB Mixture)

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Strategy Selection expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    alpha = float(parameters["alpha"])
    
    # Strategy 1: Compensatory WADD
    w_wadd = val ** gamma
    score_a = np.sum(w_wadd * a)
    score_b = np.sum(w_wadd * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_wadd = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Strategy 2: Non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB)
    order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")
    p_ttb = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    # Mixture of strategies
    p_core = alpha * p_wadd + (1.0 - alpha) * p_ttb
    
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.0, 5.0]
- alpha: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, this proposal replaces the single-strategy hybrid weighting with a Strategy Selection (mixture) model. It posits that human decision-makers probabilistically employ either a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy based on cardinal validities or a strictly non-compensatory Take-The-Best (TTB) strategy. The parameter `alpha` represents the probability of adopting the WADD strategy on a given evaluation. By computing the final choice probabilities as a weighted sum of the two strategies, the model captures the bimodal nature of the population—explaining both the compensatory thresholding behavior in Exp 6 and the strict drop-offs seen in Exps 1, 2, and 4.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3968 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3337 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3337.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate implements a Hybrid Cardinal-Rank Weighting theory, which was accepted by the gate (improving over the previous base). However, the simulated values still diverge significantly from the observed data across multiple experiments. For example, in Exp 1 (Obs=0.2988, Cand=0.6529) and Exp 2 (Obs=0.7037, Cand=0.3847), the model over- or under-predicts the reliance on specific cues. The single-strategy hybrid weighting approach struggles to capture the bimodal nature of human decision-making, where some subjects might be purely compensatory while others are strictly non-compensatory.
Rationale: While the hybrid weighting improved the overall loss, it fails to capture the specific empirical values for Exps 1, 2, and 4. Since the arbiter explicitly allowed a 'Strategy Selection' theory, revise the candidate to implement a mixture model. Instead of computing a single hybrid weight for all decisions, model the population as a mixture of two distinct strategies: a compensatory WADD strategy (using pure cardinal validities) and a non-compensatory strategy (e.g., Take-The-Best or pure rank-based). Introduce a mixture parameter (e.g., `alpha` in [0, 1]) that represents the probability of a subject using the compensatory strategy vs the non-compensatory strategy on any given trial, and compute the final choice probabilities as a weighted sum of the probabilities from each strategy.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3968 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3337 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Strategy Selection (mixture of WADD and TTB) model successfully improved the aggregate loss and was accepted by the gate. However, the model still overestimates the reliance on TTB (Exp 1: Obs=0.2988 vs Cand=0.6685) and underestimates the reliance on compensatory/tallying behavior (Exp 2: Obs=0.7037 vs Cand=0.4324). The high TTB match and low Tallying match suggest that the mixture currently favors TTB too heavily, or that the WADD component is behaving too much like TTB (which happens when gamma is high).",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "To better match the empirical data, we need to shift the model's balance away from TTB and towards compensatory evaluation. Maintain the Strategy Selection (WADD + TTB) mechanism, but adjust the parameter ranges to encourage this shift. Specifically, restrict the mixture weight `alpha` to a higher range (e.g., [0.5, 1.0]) so the model defaults to WADD more often. Additionally, reduce the upper bound of `gamma` (e.g., [0.0, 2.0]) to ensure the WADD strategy remains truly compensatory (closer to tallying) rather than mimicking TTB through extreme exponentiation."
