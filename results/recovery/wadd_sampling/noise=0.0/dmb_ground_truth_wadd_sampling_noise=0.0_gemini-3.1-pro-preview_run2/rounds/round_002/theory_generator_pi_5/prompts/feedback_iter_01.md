# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a 'Bayesian Cue Integration' (or Naive Bayes) theory. In this theory, instead of using an arbitrary exponent to scale weights (like WADD) or mixing rigid heuristics (like the Mixture model), decision-makers translate the provided cue validities into log-odds weights: w_i = log(v_i / (1 - v_i)). The evidence for each option is the sum of the log-odds for the cues it possesses. This provides a principled, normatively grounded mechanism for how people naturally scale probabilities into decision weights, naturally steepening high validities and flattening low ones without requiring ad-hoc non-linear transformations.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Bayesian Cue Integration (Naive Bayes): Decision-makers process cues as conditionally independent pieces of evidence, translating each cue's validity into a log-odds weight (w_i = log(v_i / (1 - v_i))). A present cue provides positive evidence, while an absent cue provides negative evidence of equal magnitude. The overall evidence for an option is the sum of these log-odds contributions, which are then compared via a softmax choice rule.

    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    # Clip validities to avoid division by zero or log of zero
    # Validities are typically in [0.5, 1.0]
    val = np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)
    
    # Calculate log-odds weights for each cue
    weights = np.log(val / (1.0 - val))

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Addressed the critic's feedback by mapping the binary cues from {0, 1} to {-1, 1} using the formula `(2 * cue - 1)`. This ensures that an absent cue (0) correctly provides negative evidence (equivalent to adding `log((1-v)/v)`), which aligns the mechanism with a faithful Naive Bayes model where evidence accumulation symmetrically penalizes the absence of highly valid cues.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4510 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4607 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4510.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory successfully implemented the arbiter's requested Bayesian Cue Integration (Naive Bayes) family, where weights are derived from log-odds. However, the model significantly misfits the data on several experiments, particularly Experiment 1 (predicts 0.79 vs 0.35) and Experiment 6 (predicts 0.16 vs 0.60). A major issue is the mathematical formulation of the Naive Bayes evidence accumulation. The candidate currently only adds the log-odds weight when a cue is present (1) and adds 0 when a cue is absent (0). In a true Naive Bayes model for binary cues, an absent cue (0) provides negative evidence, meaning it should contribute log((1-v)/v), which is the exact inverse of the positive evidence. By treating 0 as 'no evidence' rather than 'negative evidence', the model drastically distorts the relative values of the options.
Rationale: The model remains in the correct prescribed family, but the cue integration math needs a minor adjustment to be a faithful Naive Bayes model. Revise the evidence calculation such that a cue value of 1 adds `log(v / (1-v))` and a cue value of 0 adds `log((1-v) / v)` (or equivalently, subtracts `log(v / (1-v))`). You can achieve this by mapping the binary cues from {0, 1} to {-1, 1} before multiplying by the log-odds weights: e.g., `score_a = np.sum((2 * a - 1) * weights)`. Keep the parameter ranges and the rest of the softmax policy the same.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4510 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.4607 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate theory mapped absent cues to negative evidence (-1) to faithfully implement Naive Bayes, but this was REJECTED by the loop, indicating that treating absent cues as 'no evidence' (0) rather than 'negative evidence' (-1) actually provides a better fit to human data in this paradigm. However, the base model (Iteration 1) still struggles significantly, particularly in Experiment 1 (predicting 0.80 vs observed 0.35) and Experiment 6 (predicting 0.17 vs observed 0.60). The log-odds transformation naturally steepens high validities, which may be causing the model to over-weight the most valid cues and act too deterministically compared to human subjects. Humans likely dampen these extreme provided probabilities.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since mapping absent cues to -1 was rejected, revert to treating absent cues as 0 (the base model will do this automatically). To address the extreme predictions caused by steep log-odds weights, introduce a 'belief dampening' or 'prior' parameter that contracts the provided validities toward 0.5 before the log-odds transformation. For example, use `val_adj = 0.5 + (val - 0.5) * gamma`, where `gamma` is a new free parameter in [0.0, 1.0]. This keeps the prescribed Bayesian Cue Integration mechanism intact while preventing high-validity cues from completely dominating the evidence sum, allowing for a more calibrated fit."
