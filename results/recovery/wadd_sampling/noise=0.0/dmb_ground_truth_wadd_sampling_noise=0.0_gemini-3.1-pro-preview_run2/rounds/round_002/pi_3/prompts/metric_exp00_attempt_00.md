# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate WADD from a Heuristic Mixture of Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying, we exploit the non-linear compensatory nature of WADD. The Heuristic Mixture model can only produce choice probabilities that are linear interpolations between TTB (which strictly chooses based on the highest validity cue) and Tallying (which strictly counts the number of winning cues). We construct 'Tie-Breaker' trials where Tallying predicts a tie (equal number of winning cues for both options) and TTB strongly favors Option B. Consequently, the Mixture model MUST favor Option B (or predict a tie if p_mix = 0). However, WADD with a low gamma parameter (which flattens validities) will actually favor Option A, because the sum of multiple moderately-high validities for Option A exceeds the sum of the highest and lowest validities for Option B. This creates a stark qualitative and quantitative divergence where WADD predicts a preference reversal that the Mixture model mathematically cannot capture.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People integrate information from multiple cues by computing a weighted sum of the feature values, where the weights are a non-linear transformation of the cues' validities. This Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy is compensatory but incorporates a scaling parameter (gamma) that can exponentiate the validities. This allows the decision-maker to dynamically re-balance attention—either steepening the weights to behave more like Take The Best, or flattening them to behave more like Tallying—to match the empirical balance of conflict resolution.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.1, 5.0]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Heuristic Mixture (Strategy Selection) Theory: Decision-makers do not rely on a single strategy; instead, they probabilistically select between different heuristics on each trial. Specifically, they mix between a non-compensatory, lexicographic strategy (Take-The-Best) and a non-weighted, compensatory strategy (Tallying). A mixture parameter governs the probability of using TTB versus Tallying, allowing the model to capture intermediate choice behaviors by blending one-reason decision making with simple feature-counting.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.25]
- p_mix: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

For the Heuristic Mixture model, Tallying predicts a tie (2 vs 2 cues) while Take-The-Best strictly favors Option B (which has the highest-validity cue). Therefore, the Mixture model will mathematically cap the probability of choosing Option A at 0.5. In contrast, the Weighted Additive (WADD) model, by non-linearly scaling and summing validities, will often find that the combined weight of Option A's moderately high validities exceeds Option B's extreme validities, predicting a preference reversal (P(Choose A) > 0.5). This stark divergence in choice proportions strongly discriminates the two theories."
