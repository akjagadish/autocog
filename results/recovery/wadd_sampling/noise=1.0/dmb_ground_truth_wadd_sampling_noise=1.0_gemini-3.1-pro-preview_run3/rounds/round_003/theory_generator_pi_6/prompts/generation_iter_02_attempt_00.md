# generation_iter_02_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Propose the 'Rank-Weighted Additive Theory'. This theory posits that decision-makers ignore the exact numerical validities provided and instead assign exponentially decaying weights based solely on the ordinal rank of the cues (e.g., w_k = 1 / 2^k). They then compute a weighted sum for each option and choose probabilistically (via softmax). Because the highest-ranked cue's weight equals the sum of all lower-ranked cues' weights, this theory naturally predicts the ~50% guessing rate observed on '1 vs all' adversarial trials without needing arbitrary thresholds or conflict-based guessing rules.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.844)

**Description**
Threshold Tallying Theory posits that decision makers evaluate options by counting the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other (unweighted tallying). However, they only make a confident directional choice if the difference in winning features between the two options meets or exceeds a certain cognitive threshold. If the difference in evidence is below this threshold (e.g., a difference of 0 or 1), the decision maker finds the evidence too ambiguous or weak, leading to cognitive overload or uncertainty, and they resort to uniform guessing. This captures the persistent ~50% choice rates observed across many adversarial trials where the feature counts are closely matched.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.562)

**Description**
Conflict-Induced Guessing Theory posits that decision makers concurrently evaluate options using both a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory heuristic (Tallying). When these two strategies agree, the decision maker confidently chooses the favored option (subject to standard softmax noise). However, when the strategies conflict—or when one strategy fails to corroborate the other (e.g., Tallying is tied while TTB prefers one option)—the decision maker experiences cognitive conflict or ambiguity. Unable to easily resolve this conflict, they resort to uniform guessing. This explains the consistent ~50% choice rates observed on adversarial trials and trials with weak corroborating evidence without requiring extreme parameter values.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.502)

**Description**
Weighted Additive (WADD) theory posits that decision makers integrate all available information by computing a weighted sum of the features for each option. The weights correspond to the cue validities, often transformed into log-odds to represent the evidence weight of each cue. The option with the higher weighted sum is more likely to be chosen, with choices generated via a softmax function over the options' values. This compensatory mechanism allows multiple lower-validity cues to jointly outweigh or tie with a single higher-validity cue, explaining ~50% choice rates on adversarial trials where these conflicting evidence sources balance out.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.4303 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3667 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3667 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Rank-Weighted Additive Theory posits that decision-makers ignore the exact numerical validities provided and instead assign exponentially decaying weights based solely on the ordinal rank of the cues. The lowest-ranked cue is assigned a weight equal to the second-lowest-ranked cue. This ensures that the sum of all lower-ranked cues exactly equals the highest-ranked cue. They then compute a weighted sum for each option and choose probabilistically (via softmax). Because the highest-ranked cue's weight perfectly equals the sum of all lower-ranked cues' weights, this theory naturally predicts the exact ~50% guessing rate observed on '1 vs all' adversarial trials without needing arbitrary thresholds or conflict-based guessing rules.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Get validities and determine ordinal rank (0 is highest rank)
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")
    
    # Assign exponentially decaying weights based on rank.
    # To ensure the sum of all lower-ranked cues exactly equals the highest-ranked cue,
    # the lowest-ranked cue gets the same weight as the second-lowest-ranked cue.
    w = np.zeros_like(val)
    n_cues = len(cue_order)
    for i, cue_idx in enumerate(cue_order):
        if i == n_cues - 1 and n_cues > 1:
            w[cue_idx] = 1.0 / (2.0 ** i)
        else:
            w[cue_idx] = 1.0 / (2.0 ** (i + 1))
        
    # Compute weighted sum for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a * w)
    score_b = np.sum(b * w)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Apply lapse rate
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the critic's diagnosis, the previous model assigned weights as strictly w_k = 1 / 2^(k+1), which resulted in the sum of all lower-ranked cues being slightly less than the highest-ranked cue. Multiplied by a large beta parameter, this small difference led to confident choices instead of the empirical ~50% guessing rate on 1-vs-all trials. This minimal edit modifies the weight assignment so that the lowest-ranked cue receives the same weight as the second-lowest-ranked cue (e.g., 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/16). This ensures the sum of all lower-ranked cues exactly equals the highest-ranked cue, producing a true tie (score difference of 0) and naturally yielding a 50% choice probability via softmax.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory attempts to implement the Rank-Weighted Additive Theory by assigning exponentially decaying weights w_k = 1 / 2^(k+1). However, under this formulation, the sum of all lower-ranked cues is strictly less than the highest-ranked cue by 1/2^n. Because the beta parameter can go up to 50, this small difference is amplified by the softmax function, leading the model to make confident predictions rather than the ~50% guessing rate observed in the empirical data for '1 vs all' adversarial trials. This is why the candidate fails to match the ~0.50 empirical metrics across Experiments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
Rationale: The candidate correctly adopted the prescribed Rank-Weighted Additive family, but the exact mathematical implementation of the weights leaves a small residual difference between the top cue and all lower cues combined. To perfectly capture the ~50% guessing rate on 1-vs-all trials regardless of the beta parameter, the score difference must be exactly zero. Adjust the weight assignment so that the lowest-ranked cue's weight equals the second-lowest-ranked cue's weight (e.g., for n=5, weights should be 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/16). This ensures the sum of all lower-ranked cues exactly equals the highest-ranked cue, yielding a score difference of 0 and a natural 50% choice probability via softmax.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4303 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3667 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implemented the exact tie logic for 1-vs-all trials by adjusting the weight of the lowest-ranked cue, which improved the overall aggregate loss. However, the model still makes overly extreme predictions on several experiments (e.g., Exp 5, 6, 7, and 8). Because the parameter range for `beta` extends up to 50.0, any small difference in the rank-weighted scores (such as 5/8 vs 3/8) is amplified into a near-deterministic choice. The empirical data suggests that human choices are much softer and noisier when the evidence differences are small.
Rationale: The prescribed Rank-Weighted Additive mechanism is correctly implemented and should be kept. However, the parameter range for the softmax temperature/sensitivity (`beta`) is too wide. A beta up to 50.0 causes the model to behave deterministically even for minor score differences, leading to severe over/under-predictions in Exps 5-8 compared to the near-0.5 empirical values. Tighten the `beta` parameter range from [0.1, 50.0] to [0.1, 5.0] to enforce softer, more probabilistic choices that better reflect human noise levels when evaluating rank-weighted sums.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3667 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
