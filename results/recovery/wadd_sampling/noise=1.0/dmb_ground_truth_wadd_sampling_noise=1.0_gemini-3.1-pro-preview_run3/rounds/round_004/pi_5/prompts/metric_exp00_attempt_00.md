# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=7):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Threshold Tallying Theory (TT) from Rank-Weighted Additive Theory (RWA), we use a 7-feature design. RWA posits that decision-makers assign exponentially decaying weights based on cue rank, with the lowest-ranked cues summing exactly to the weight of any higher-ranked cue. This means a '1 vs all' adversarial trial produces perfectly tied scores, leading RWA to predict uniform guessing. TT ignores validities and counts strict feature-wise wins, predicting guessing only when the absolute difference in wins is below a cognitive threshold (1.5 to 3.5). We design 'RWA-guess / TT-confident' trials where Option A wins on the single highest-validity cue and Option B wins on all 6 remaining cues. Here, RWA scores are perfectly tied (guessing), but the win difference is 5, exceeding TT's maximum threshold (TT predicts confident B). Conversely, we design 'TT-guess / RWA-confident' trials where Option A wins on the top cues while Option B wins on just enough lower cues to make the win difference 0 or 1. Here, TT predicts guessing because the difference is below the minimum threshold, while RWA's exponentially decaying weights strongly favor the option with the higher-ranked cues.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Threshold Tallying Theory posits that decision makers evaluate options by counting the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other (unweighted tallying). However, they only make a confident directional choice if the difference in winning features between the two options meets or exceeds a certain cognitive threshold. If the difference in evidence is below this threshold (e.g., a difference of 0 or 1), the decision maker finds the evidence too ambiguous or weak, leading to cognitive overload or uncertainty, and they resort to uniform guessing. This captures the persistent ~50% choice rates observed across many adversarial trials where the feature counts are closely matched.

**Parameters:**
- threshold: [1.5, 3.5]
- beta: [0.1, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

**`predict source code`:**

        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Count strict feature-wise wins for each option
    a_wins = np.sum(a > b)
    b_wins = np.sum(b > a)
    
    diff = abs(a_wins - b_wins)
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    
    # If the difference is below the threshold, the evidence is deemed too weak -> guessing
    if diff < threshold:
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        # Otherwise, make a choice based on the tally scores using softmax

```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Rank-Weighted Additive Theory posits that decision-makers ignore the exact numerical validities provided and instead assign exponentially decaying weights based solely on the ordinal rank of the cues. The lowest-ranked cue is assigned a weight equal to the second-lowest-ranked cue. This ensures that the sum of all lower-ranked cues exactly equals the highest-ranked cue. They then compute a weighted sum for each option and choose probabilistically (via softmax). Because the highest-ranked cue's weight perfectly equals the sum of all lower-ranked cues' weights, this theory naturally predicts the exact ~50% guessing rate observed on '1 vs all' adversarial trials without needing arbitrary thresholds or conflict-based guessing rules.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Get validities and determine ordinal rank (0 is highest rank)
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")
    
    # Assign exponentially decaying weights based on rank.
    # To ensure the sum of all lower-ranked cues exactly equals the highest-ranked cue,
    # the lowest-ranked cue gets the same weight as the second-lowest-ranked cue.
    w = np.zeros_like(val)
    n_cues = len(cue_order)
    for i, cue_idx in enumerate(cue_order):
        if i == n_cues - 1 and n_cues > 1:
            w[cue_idx] = 1.0 / (2.0 ** i)
        else:
            w[cue_idx] = 1.0 / (2.0 ** (i + 1))
        
    # Compute weighted sum for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a * w)
    score_b = np.sum(b * w)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Apply lapse rate
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])

def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This metric contrasts choices between two sets of trials to maximally dissociate the theories. In Group 1 (Trials 1 & 2), Option A wins on the top cue while B wins on almost all others. TT predicts a confident choice for B (the tally difference is large), whereas RWA predicts uniform guessing (the exponentially decaying weights exactly tie). In Group 2 (Trials 3 & 4), the tally difference is small but the top cues favor A. Here, TT predicts uniform guessing (due to the tally difference falling below the cognitive threshold), while RWA predicts a strong preference for A (due to the heavy weight of the top cues). The metric calculates P(Choose B | Group 1) - P(Choose A | Group 2). TT yields ~ 1.0 - 0.5 = 0.5, while RWA yields ~ 0.5 - 1.0 = -0.5, providing a robust and diametrically opposed contrast."
