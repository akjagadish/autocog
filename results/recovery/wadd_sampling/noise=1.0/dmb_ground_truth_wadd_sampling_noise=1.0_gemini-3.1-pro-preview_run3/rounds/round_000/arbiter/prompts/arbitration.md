# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from Tallying, we use a 5-feature design with spread validities. We design trials where the option with the single highest-validity discriminating cue (the TTB winner) is opposed by the option that has a greater overall number of positive features (the Tallying winner). TTB decides based solely on the first discriminating cue in descending validity order, while Tallying simply counts the number of cues favoring each option, ignoring validities entirely.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric directly computes the proportion of trials where the subject's choice matches the prediction of the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic. Because the experimental design explicitly pits TTB against Tallying (where the option with the highest-validity discriminating cue is usually opposed by the option with more overall positive features), a subject following TTB will have a high match rate (close to 1.0, modulo noise), whereas a subject following Tallying will consistently pick the opposite option, yielding a very low match rate.

        b = row['option_b_ratings']
        resp = row['response']
        
        winner = None

                winner = 1
                break
        if winner is not None:
            matches.append(1 if resp == winner else 0)
    return float(np.mean(matches)) if matches else 0.5

### RESULTS
- Predicted under pi_1 (simulated): 0.8477 (var=0.0132)
- Predicted under pi_2 (simulated): 0.2398 (var=0.0060)

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Tallying from Take The Best (TTB), this design uses 5 features with strictly descending validities. In each trial, Option A is constructed to win on the highest-validity discriminating cue (making it the TTB choice), while Option B is constructed to win on a greater number of lower-validity cues (making it the Tallying choice). Because Tallying ignores validities and simply counts feature-wise wins, it will consistently select Option B. TTB, which stops at the first discriminating cue, will consistently select Option A.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
By design, Option A is constructed to win on the most valid discriminating cue (the Take The Best choice), while Option B always wins on a greater total number of cues (the Tallying choice). Because the response column encodes choice A as 0 and choice B as 1, the mean of the response column directly measures the proportion of Tallying choices. Tallying will yield a high value (close to 1), whereas Take The Best will yield a low value (close to 0).

### RESULTS
- Predicted under pi_1 (simulated): 0.1488 (var=0.0095)

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Both Take The Best (TTB) and Tallying fail to capture the observed data. In both experiments, the experimental designs pitted TTB against Tallying, expecting choices to heavily favor one or the other. Instead, the observed metric values are extremely close to 0.50 with very low between-subject variance. This indicates that subjects are not deterministically using either heuristic, but are instead choosing options at roughly chance levels on these specific adversarial trials. A compensatory model that computes a weighted sum of the cues (where multiple weaker cues can roughly balance out a single strong cue) might better explain this ambiguity, especially when paired with a softmax choice rule that naturally produces ~50/50 probabilities when the weighted evidence for both options is similar.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. Unlike TTB (which uses only the top discriminating cue) and Tallying (which ignores validities and counts wins), WADD assumes subjects compute a weighted sum of the features for each option, using the cue validities (or a transformation of them, like log-odds) as weights. The choice is then made via a softmax function over these weighted sums. This compensatory approach allows multiple lower-validity cues to compete with a single high-validity cue, potentially resulting in similar expected values for both options on these adversarial trials and thereby explaining the ~50% choice rates observed in the data."
