# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** The design aims to strongly dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from Tallying. TTB relies solely on the most valid discriminating cue, entirely ignoring the number of cues supporting each option. Tallying simply counts the number of supporting cues, ignoring their validities. We use 5 features with descending validities. In several critical trials, one option is favored by the single highest-validity cue (winning under TTB) while the other option is favored by a larger number of lower-validity cues (winning under Tallying). We also include trials where Tallying produces a tie (equal number of winning cues) but TTB makes a deterministic prediction based on the most valid cue.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with the Take The Best (TTB) prediction. The experimental design strongly dissociates TTB from Tallying: out of 8 trial types, TTB and Tallying make strictly opposite predictions on 6 of them, and Tallying predicts a tie on the remaining 2. Consequently, data generated by the TTB theory will yield a metric value close to 1.0, while data generated by the Tallying theory will yield a value close to 0.125 (since it systematically chooses the opposite option on 75% of trials and guesses on the rest). This massive mean difference, combined with the low per-subject variance over 96 trials, guarantees a highly significant discrimination.

                total += 1
                break
    return float(matches / total) if total > 0 else 0.5

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** This design systematically dissociates Tallying from Take The Best (TTB) by pitting the single most valid discriminating cue against a larger quantity of less valid cues. Under TTB, the option with the higher value on the most valid discriminating feature is chosen deterministically, completely ignoring the sheer number of features supporting the other option. In contrast, Tallying simply counts the number of features favoring each option, ignoring validities entirely. The trial set includes cases where TTB strongly prefers one option while Tallying prefers the other, as well as cases where Tallying predicts a tie (equal number of winning features) while TTB makes a deterministic prediction based on the top cue.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with the strict prediction of the Tallying heuristic, on trials where Tallying makes a strict prediction (i.e., no ties). Because the experimental design deliberately pits Tallying against Take The Best (TTB) such that they often make diametrically opposite predictions, this metric will yield a high value under the Tallying theory and a very low value under TTB, providing a clean and highly discriminative contrast.

- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Both Take The Best (THEORY 1) and Tallying (THEORY 2) fail dramatically to capture the observed data. In Experiment 1, TTB predicted ~0.82 and Tallying ~0.22, but the observed metric was ~0.49. In Experiment 2, TTB predicted ~0.16 and Tallying ~0.85, but the observed metric was ~0.50. The fact that the observed data lies almost exactly halfway between the predictions of the two extreme heuristics suggests that subjects are either highly heterogeneous (some using TTB, some Tallying) or, more likely, are using a compensatory strategy that integrates both the number of cues and their validities. A Weighted Additive (WADD) model, which computes a weighted sum of features using their validities, would naturally predict intermediate choices on these adversarial designs where the highest validity cue opposes a larger number of lower validity cues.",

  "recommendation": "Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. Unlike Take The Best (which uses only the single best discriminating cue) and Tallying (which counts cues but ignores their validities), WADD assumes that decision-makers integrate all available information by taking the dot product of the option features and the cue validities. The choice is then made stochastically via a softmax over the expected values of the two options. This compensatory theory can explain why the population average sits exactly between the predictions of the two non-compensatory heuristics."
