# generation_iter_02_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Propose a brand-new theory that explicitly accounts for this robust 50/50 split on strict conflict trials. The new theory could posit a 'Mixture of Heuristics' where the population is evenly divided between subjects using strict Take-The-Best and subjects using unweighted Tallying, which naturally balances out to ~0.5 on conflict trials. Alternatively, the theory could propose 'Conflict-Induced Guessing', where subjects compute a quick conflict signal (e.g., top-cue favors A, but overall count favors B) and resort to random guessing when the conflict is too high. This will better capture the pervasive 0.5 choice probabilities observed across all these experiments.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.829)

**Description**
Decision-makers use a Compensatory / Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy, where an overall value for each option is computed by weighting each feature by a subjective transformation of its validity (validity raised to a power) and summing these weighted features. On strict conflict trials, the high weight of the single discriminating cue roughly balances the combined weights of multiple opposing lower-validity cues. This produces a near-zero difference in overall value, naturally resulting in a choice probability near 0.5 without requiring a mixture of distinct heuristics.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.803)

**Description**
Top-K Tallying with Restricted Scope: Decision-makers simplify complex multi-attribute choices by focusing only on the top K most valid cues, ignoring all lower-validity information. By restricting K to a narrow band (1, 2, or 3) and allowing for a high degree of random guessing (lapse rate), the model produces consistent behavior across individuals while naturally capturing the pervasive ~0.5 choice probabilities on strict conflict trials where the top cues often tie or balance out.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.457)

**Description**
Strategy Mixture: Instead of adopting a single heuristic for the entire experiment, individuals probabilistically sample a decision strategy on each trial. Specifically, they mix between Take The Best (TTB) and Tallying, leading to an equal probability of choosing either option when the two heuristics strictly conflict.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.2710 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1339 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1339 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Conflict-Induced Guessing with Evidence Threshold: Decision-makers evaluate options using simple heuristics (Take The Best and Tallying) but also monitor the overall Weighted Additive (WADD) evidence. When the heuristics make strict opposing predictions, OR when the overall WADD evidence difference between the options is too small to confidently discriminate, the decision-maker experiences uncertainty and resorts to random guessing. This captures the pervasive ~0.5 choice probabilities and low variance across both strict heuristic conflict trials and trials with nominally agreeing heuristics but weak overall evidence.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))

`parameters`:
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]
- threshold: [0.0, 2.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's suggestion, I broadened the definition of uncertainty to include not just strict logical conflict between TTB and Tallying, but also cases where the Weighted Additive (WADD) evidence is very close. By adding a `threshold` parameter, the model now resorts to guessing when the absolute difference in WADD scores is small. This naturally captures the ~0.5 choice probabilities in Experiments 5, 6, and 8 where TTB and Tallying might nominally agree, but the overall evidence is too close to call, while preserving the exact same success on strict conflict trials in Experiments 1-4.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The 'Conflict-Induced Guessing' model was ACCEPTED by the gate and successfully captures the ~0.5 choice probabilities and low variance in Exps 1-4 and 7. However, it fails significantly on Exps 5, 6, and 8. For instance, in Exp 8, the model predicts ~0.80 accuracy because it assumes no conflict on trials where one option dominates the other (e.g., [1,0,1,0,0,0] vs [1,0,1,1,1,1]), yet human subjects average ~0.51. Similarly, in Exp 5, the model predicts near-deterministic choice for the option favored by both TTB and Tallying, but humans are at ~0.52. This suggests the current strict definition of 'conflict' (TTB winner != Tallying winner) is too narrow.
Rationale: The candidate is on the right track within the prescribed family but needs minor adjustments to its conflict detection or response mechanism to handle Exps 5, 6, and 8. I recommend broadening the definition of conflict/uncertainty. For example, uncertainty could also be triggered when the absolute difference in Tallying scores is too small (e.g., difference <= 1), or when the Weighted Additive (WADD) evidence is very close. Alternatively, replace the hard logical check with a continuous softmax over a combined TTB and Tallying signal, where opposing signals naturally cancel out to yield ~0.5 probabilities. Adjust the predict function to soften the strict 'if/else' guessing trigger.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2710 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1339 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The addition of the WADD difference threshold successfully improved fits for Experiments 5 and 6, and the gate ACCEPTED this candidate. The model correctly captures the ~0.5 choice probabilities in Exps 1-4 and 7. However, it still fails significantly on Experiment 8, predicting ~0.80 accuracy compared to the human average of ~0.51. In Experiment 8, the trials involve options where one might strictly dominate the other on several minor cues (e.g., [1,0,1,0,0,0] vs [1,0,1,1,1,1]). Depending on the validities, the WADD difference here might exceed the current maximum threshold of 2.0, preventing the model from triggering the guessing mechanism.
Rationale: The model is on the right track and the WADD threshold mechanism is working, but it is too constrained to handle Experiment 8. Increase the upper bound of the `threshold` parameter from 2.0 to a higher value (e.g., 4.0 or 5.0). This minor adjustment will allow the parameter search to find a threshold large enough to classify the evidence differences in Experiment 8 as 'too close to call', naturally bringing the choice probabilities down to ~0.5.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1339 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

This minimal edit allows the parameter search to find a threshold large enough to classify the slightly larger WADD evidence differences in Experiment 8 as 'too close to call', naturally bringing the choice probabilities down to ~0.5 while maintaining the successful fits on all other experiments."
