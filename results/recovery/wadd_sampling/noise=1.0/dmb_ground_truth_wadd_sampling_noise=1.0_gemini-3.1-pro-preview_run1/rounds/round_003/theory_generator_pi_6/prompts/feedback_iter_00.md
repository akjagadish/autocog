# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Propose a brand-new theory that explicitly accounts for this robust 50/50 split on strict conflict trials. The new theory could posit a 'Mixture of Heuristics' where the population is evenly divided between subjects using strict Take-The-Best and subjects using unweighted Tallying, which naturally balances out to ~0.5 on conflict trials. Alternatively, the theory could propose 'Conflict-Induced Guessing', where subjects compute a quick conflict signal (e.g., top-cue favors A, but overall count favors B) and resort to random guessing when the conflict is too high. This will better capture the pervasive 0.5 choice probabilities observed across all these experiments.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Conflict-Induced Guessing: Decision-makers compute two rapid, parallel evaluations of the options—one based on the single most valid discriminating cue (Take The Best) and one based on the overall count of positive features (Tallying). When these two simple heuristics point to the same option or one is indifferent, the subject confidently chooses the favored option. However, when the heuristics make strict, opposing predictions, the decision-maker experiences cognitive conflict and uncertainty, leading them to resort to random guessing. This mechanism naturally produces both the ~0.5 choice probabilities and the low between-subject variance observed on conflict trials, as every individual guesses rather than the population being split into distinct, rigid strategy groups.

`parameters`:
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
The arbiter suggested two ways to account for the ~0.5 choice probabilities on strict conflict trials: a 'Mixture of Heuristics' (half the population uses TTB, half uses Tallying) or 'Conflict-Induced Guessing'. While a population split would yield a mean of 0.5, it would generate a very high between-subject variance (close to 0.25) because each subject would consistently choose one option. The experimental data shows a very low between-subject variance (e.g., var=0.0051 in Exp 1), indicating that individual subjects are themselves choosing at chance on these trials. Therefore, I implemented the 'Conflict-Induced Guessing' mechanism. The model computes both a TTB and a Tallying signal; if they conflict, the subject experiences uncertainty and guesses (p=0.5). If they agree or one is indifferent, the subject follows the clear signal. This naturally captures both the 0.5 point estimates and the low variance.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2710 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2710.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The 'Conflict-Induced Guessing' model was ACCEPTED by the gate and successfully captures the ~0.5 choice probabilities and low variance in Exps 1-4 and 7. However, it fails significantly on Exps 5, 6, and 8. For instance, in Exp 8, the model predicts ~0.80 accuracy because it assumes no conflict on trials where one option dominates the other (e.g., [1,0,1,0,0,0] vs [1,0,1,1,1,1]), yet human subjects average ~0.51. Similarly, in Exp 5, the model predicts near-deterministic choice for the option favored by both TTB and Tallying, but humans are at ~0.52. This suggests the current strict definition of 'conflict' (TTB winner != Tallying winner) is too narrow.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate is on the right track within the prescribed family but needs minor adjustments to its conflict detection or response mechanism to handle Exps 5, 6, and 8. I recommend broadening the definition of conflict/uncertainty. For example, uncertainty could also be triggered when the absolute difference in Tallying scores is too small (e.g., difference <= 1), or when the Weighted Additive (WADD) evidence is very close. Alternatively, replace the hard logical check with a continuous softmax over a combined TTB and Tallying signal, where opposing signals naturally cancel out to yield ~0.5 probabilities. Adjust the predict function to soften the strict 'if/else' guessing trigger."
