# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_3") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Take The Best (Gigerenzer & Goldstein 1996).

## THEORY 2 — pi_3
People compare options by computing a compensatory overall value for each option. This is done by summing the features of each option weighted by their respective validities (Weighted Additive rule). Because empirical behavior in these experiments is highly stochastic (near random guessing), choice is subject to significant softmax noise and lapse rates. Narrowing the inverse temperature bounds forces the model to capture this high level of noise.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the non-compensatory Take The Best (TTB) heuristic from the compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) rule. We use 5 features with a wide spread of validities. Crucially, the competing WADD model is restricted to a low inverse temperature (beta <= 1.0), meaning it can only predict highly stochastic choices (probabilities near 0.5) even when the weighted score difference is maximal. TTB's beta can range up to 20.0, allowing it to predict deterministic, highly confident choices. The trial pairs are constructed as 'compensatory vs. non-compensatory' conflicts: one option always wins on the single highest-validity discriminating cue (the TTB choice), while the other option wins on a multitude of lower-validity cues, giving it a higher overall weighted sum (the WADD choice). Thus, TTB predicts strong choices for Option A on most trials, while WADD predicts weak choices for Option B.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates 'conflict trials' where the non-compensatory Take The Best (TTB) heuristic and the compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) rule predict opposite choices. By calculating the proportion of choices that align with the TTB prediction exclusively on these trials, we strongly separate the two theories. TTB will inherently yield a mean significantly above 0.5 (as its predictions align with the TTB choices), while WADD will yield a mean strictly below 0.5 (as its stochastic choices are biased toward the WADD option, which is the exact opposite of the TTB prediction).

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**

  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 9: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) rule from the non-compensatory Take The Best (TTB) heuristic. The trial pairs systematically pit the single highest-validity discriminating cue against a coalition of lower-validity cues. In every trial, TTB predicts choice for the option that wins on the earliest discriminating cue, completely ignoring the rest of the features. Conversely, WADD integrates all features and consistently predicts choice for the opposite option, which has a higher total weighted sum due to winning on multiple lower-validity cues. By varying which cue is the highest discriminating one (e.g., the first vs. the second vs. the third) and balancing the left/right presentation, we create a robust set of choices where the two models make diametrically opposed predictions across the entire experiment.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design consists of trials that explicitly pit the predictions of WADD against those of TTB. In every single trial, the two models make diametrically opposed predictions. This metric computes the proportion of choices that are consistent with the WADD model. For data generated by WADD, this proportion will be well above 0.5 (modulo response noise), whereas for data generated by TTB, it will be well below 0.5.
