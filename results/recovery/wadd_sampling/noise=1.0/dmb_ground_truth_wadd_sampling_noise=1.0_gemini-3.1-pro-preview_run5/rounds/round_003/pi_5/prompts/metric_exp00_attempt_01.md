# metric_exp00_attempt_01

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Tallying under Overload theory from the pure Cognitive Overload (random guessing) theory, we must test whether choice probabilities remain completely flat across trials or whether they track the unweighted feature tally differences, even if heavily dampened by extreme noise and lapse rates. We use 8 features to create a wide spectrum of tally differences between Option A and Option B, ranging from +8 to -8. The Tallying under Overload theory predicts a slight but systematic monotonic relationship between the tally difference and the probability of choosing A, whereas the pure Cognitive Overload theory predicts a completely flat choice rate driven only by a constant spatial side bias.

**Computed schedule:** 9 unique pairs × 10 reps = 90 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Tallying under Overload (Equal Weights): Under cognitive overload without trial-by-trial feedback, subjects abandon complex integration of cue validities. Instead, they fall back on a highly simplified Equal Weights heuristic, merely tallying the total number of positive features (1s) for each option. Even with this simplification, the high cognitive demand leads to near-random choice behavior, which is captured by extreme softmax noise and a very high lapse rate.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.0, 0.2]
- epsilon: [0.8, 1.0]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    
    # Equal Weights / Tallying: count the number of positive features (1s) for each option
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    a_score = np.sum(a)
    b_score = np.sum(b)
    scores = np.array([a_score, b_score])
    
    beta = float(parameters['beta'])
    epsilon = float(parameters['epsilon'])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Apply high lapse rate
    n_opts = len(scores)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** When faced with complex multi-attribute choices without trial-by-trial feedback, subjects experience cognitive overload. Instead of systematically integrating cue validities and feature vectors, they abandon structured decision strategies and resort to random guessing. Choice behavior is driven entirely by this stochasticity, with only a potential slight bias toward one spatial position (e.g., Option A or Option B) over the other.

**Parameters:**
- side_bias: [0.3, 0.7]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    # Under cognitive overload, subjects ignore the state (features) and just guess.
    # The choice probability is determined only by an intrinsic side bias.
    p_b = float(parameters.get('side_bias', 0.5))
    p_a = 1.0 - p_b
    return np.array([p_a, p_b])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
[0] rationale: The Advocated theory (Tallying under Overload) predicts that despite extreme noise, subjects will be slightly more likely to choose Option A when it has more positive features than Option B. The Competing theory (Cognitive Overload) predicts choice probabilities depend solely on a constant side bias, making them independent of the features. This metric calculates the difference in the rate of choosing Option A when A has more positive features versus when B has more positive features. It should be strictly positive under the Advocated theory and roughly zero under the Competing theory.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- metric: Python source defining def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this metric; used when interpreting results.


## Response

```json
{
  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    # Group by subject and calculate each subject's overall choice rate for Option B\n    subject_means = data.groupby('subject_id')['response'].mean()\n    # Calculate the absolute deviation from 0.5 (which represents no side bias)\n    # and return the mean deviation across subjects.\n    return float(subject_means.apply(lambda x: abs(x - 0.5)).mean())",
  "rationale": "The Competing theory (Cognitive Overload) posits that subjects fall back on a random guessing strategy driven by a constant side bias, which varies uniformly between 0.3 and 0.7 across subjects. This results in an expected absolute deviation from 0.5 of roughly 0.10. The Advocated theory (Tallying under Overload) assumes subjects use equal weights to tally features. Since the experimental design is perfectly symmetric (for every trial favoring A, there is a mirror trial favoring B), the true overall choice rate for any subject under the Advocated theory is exactly 0.5. Any deviation from 0.5 is solely due to binomial noise, yielding a much smaller expected absolute deviation (around 0.04). Therefore, the mean absolute deviation of the subject's overall choice rate from 0.5 strongly discriminates the two theories."
