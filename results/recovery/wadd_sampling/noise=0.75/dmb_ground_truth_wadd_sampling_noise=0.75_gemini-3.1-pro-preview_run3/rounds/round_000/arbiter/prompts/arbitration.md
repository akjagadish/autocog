# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** The experiment is designed to strongly dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from Tallying. We use 5 features with varying validities. In the critical trials, the option favored by TTB has a positive value on the single most valid discriminating cue but negative values on several lower-validity cues, while the option favored by Tallying has positive values on multiple lower-validity cues but a negative value on the most valid discriminating cue. This directly pits the non-compensatory, one-reason stopping rule of TTB against the compensatory, equal-weight counting rule of Tallying.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design pits Take The Best (TTB) against Tallying on every single trial. TTB always chooses the option that wins on the most valid discriminating feature, whereas Tallying always chooses the option that wins on a greater number of less valid features. By computing the proportion of trials where the participant's choice aligns with the TTB prediction, we can perfectly discriminate between the two models. TTB will yield a high proportion (close to 1, depending on noise), while Tallying will yield a low proportion (close to 0).

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** These trials are designed to strictly dissociate Tallying (the advocated theory) from Take The Best (TTB, the competing theory). The experiment pits the one-reason stopping rule of TTB against the compensatory, equal-weight counting rule of Tallying. In most trials, the option favored by TTB has a positive value on the single most valid discriminating cue, but the other option is favored by Tallying because it has positive values on a larger number of lower-validity cues. We also include trials where Tallying predicts a tie (yielding uniform guessing) while TTB makes a deterministic prediction based on a single high-validity cue, allowing for a strong quantitative dissociation of the models' noise and choice mechanisms.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with Take The Best (TTB) on trials where Tallying and TTB make deterministic and opposite predictions. Under TTB, this proportion will be close to 1.0, while under Tallying, it will be close to 0.0, maximizing the discriminability between the two models.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Both TTB and Tallying fail to capture the observed data. The metrics track the proportion of choices aligning with TTB on conflict trials, yielding values around 0.45. This means subjects are neither purely using TTB (which would yield ~0.85) nor purely Tallying (which would yield ~0.15). The intermediate value, slightly favoring Tallying but close to 0.5, suggests a compensatory strategy that weights cues by their validities (e.g., a Weighted Additive model), allowing multiple weak cues to sometimes override a single strong cue, or it implies a mixture of strategies across the population.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Weighted Additive' (WADD) theory. Unlike TTB (which only uses the top discriminating cue) and Tallying (which weights all cues equally), WADD assumes people compute a weighted sum of the feature differences, where the weights correspond to the subjective validities of the cues. This allows for compensatory decision-making where multiple weak cues can override a single strong cue, but strong cues still carry more weight than weak ones. Softmax choice on the weighted sums should capture the intermediate rates observed."
