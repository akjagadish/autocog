# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Propose a 'Strategy Mixture' or 'Heuristic Selection' theory. Rather than assuming all subjects use a single deterministic strategy like Tallying or WADD, this theory should posit that the population consists of a mixture of decision-makers: some relying on compensatory integration (WADD), some on cue-counting (Tallying), and some on lexicographic rules (Take-The-Best). The model should implement a probabilistic mixture over these distinct strategies, allowing it to naturally predict intermediate metric values (~0.5) on trials where these heuristics make conflicting predictions, thereby capturing the aggregate population behavior much better than any single heuristic.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Strategy Mixture Theory with Independent Scaling: Individuals use a probabilistic mixture of distinct heuristics (WADD, Tallying, and Take-The-Best), but because the internal evidence scales of these heuristics vary dramatically (log-odds sums vs. integer counts vs. binary indicators), each heuristic applies its own independent temperature parameter to properly calibrate its choice probabilities before mixing.

`rationale`:
Independent temperature parameters (`beta_wadd`, `beta_tally`, `beta_ttb`) are implemented for each strategy to resolve scaling artifacts. Initial logic and parameters are validated. Standard processing applied to compute raw heuristic scores. The final transformation introduces distinct betas to scale scores independently before the mixture weighted average is calculated, ensuring optimal calibration without manual bounding constraints.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1410 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1549 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1411 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1308 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.1308.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory successfully implements the Arbiter's prescribed Strategy Mixture family and was accepted by the gate, significantly improving the aggregate loss. By mixing WADD, Tallying, and TTB, the model correctly pushes the predictions toward the ~0.5 range observed in human data on conflict trials. However, there is a scaling artifact in how the mixture is computed: the model applies the same temperature parameter (`beta`) to the raw scores of all three heuristics. Since WADD scores (sums of log-odds), Tallying scores (integer counts), and TTB scores (strictly 0 or 1) have completely different numerical scales, a single `beta` will arbitrarily make some heuristics highly deterministic and others nearly random. This confounds the mixture weights and explains why the model still under-predicts Experiment 4 (0.39 vs 0.52) and over-predicts Experiment 3 (0.58 vs 0.46).
Rationale: To fix the score-scaling artifact while remaining strictly within the prescribed Strategy Mixture family, simplify the heuristic outputs before mixing them. Instead of a softmax over raw scores with a shared beta, have each heuristic output a discrete prediction: 1.0 for the winning option, 0.0 for the losing option, and 0.5 for a tie. Then, compute the weighted average of these discrete probabilities using `w_wadd`, `w_tally`, and `w_ttb`, and finally apply the `epsilon` lapse rate. This ensures the mixture weights directly correspond to the proportion of the population using each strategy, completely removing the scale-dependence of the scores.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1410 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1549 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The gate rejected the discrete heuristic mixture (loss increased from 0.1410 to 0.1549). While the intention of removing score-scaling artifacts was correct, forcing each heuristic to output strictly 1.0 or 0.0 before mixing appears to be too rigid. It eliminates the natural confidence scaling that occurs when a heuristic strongly prefers an option versus when it barely prefers it (e.g., a WADD difference of 3.0 vs 0.1). By stripping out this confidence information, the model worsened its fit across the board, particularly still under-predicting Tallying in Exp 4 and over-predicting WADD in Exp 3.
Rationale: Since the discrete-output approach was rejected, revert to the softmax-based approach from Iteration 1, but fix the scaling issue differently. Instead of stripping away the continuous scores, standardize them so that a shared `beta` parameter applies fairly. For example, divide the WADD score difference by the sum of all cue weights, and divide the Tallying score difference by the total number of validities. This bounds all heuristic score differences to approximately [-1, 1], preserving the 'confidence' of each heuristic on a given trial while allowing the shared `beta` and mixture weights to operate on compatible scales.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1549 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1411 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate was REJECTED by the gate (loss 0.1411 vs running-best 0.1410). The attempt to manually normalize the scores of WADD and Tallying to a [-1, 1] range before applying a shared temperature parameter did not improve the aggregate fit over the base Iteration 1 model. While it slightly improved Experiment 1, it significantly worsened the fit on Experiment 4 (dropping from 0.3933 to 0.3472, further away from the human 0.5211). The manual normalization scheme appears too rigid and inadvertently distorts the relative confidences of the heuristics.
Rationale: Since both the discrete-output approach (Iter 2) and the manual score-normalization approach (Iter 3) were rejected by the gate, we should abandon trying to force the different heuristics onto a shared scale. Instead, revert to the raw-score formulation from Iteration 1, but solve the scaling problem by giving each continuous heuristic its own independent temperature parameter (`beta_wadd` and `beta_tally`). TTB can either use a `beta_ttb` or simply output 1/0. By allowing independent betas, the model can empirically fit the optimal scaling for each heuristic's unique numerical distribution (log-odds sums vs integer counts) without requiring artificial bounds.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1411 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1308 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "The candidate theory successfully implemented independent temperature parameters (beta_wadd, beta_tally, beta_ttb) for each heuristic, a suggestion that was ACCEPTED by the gate and lowered the aggregate loss from 0.1410 to 0.1308. By allowing each heuristic to calibrate its own internal scale before mixing, the model avoids the scaling artifacts that plagued earlier iterations. The predictions across all four experiments are now much closer to the ~0.5 range observed in human data on conflict trials, capturing the aggregate population behavior significantly better than any single heuristic or shared-temperature mixture.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The independent temperature mechanism successfully resolves the scaling issues between log-odds sums, integer counts, and binary indicators. The loss has improved, and the theory faithfully implements the Arbiter's prescribed Strategy Mixture family while incorporating the necessary flexibility to calibrate each heuristic. The current model is robust and ready to be shipped."
