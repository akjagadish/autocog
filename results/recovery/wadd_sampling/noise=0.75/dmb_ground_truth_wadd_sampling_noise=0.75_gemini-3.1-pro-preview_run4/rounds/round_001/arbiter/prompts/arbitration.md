# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
People evaluate options by computing a comprehensive weighted sum of all available features. Each feature's contribution is proportional to its objective validity transformed into log-odds (log-likelihood ratios). This allows the compensatory mechanism to properly weigh probabilistic evidence, preventing multiple weak cues from inappropriately dominating a single strong cue. Choices are generated probabilistically by applying a softmax function over the options' weighted scores, subject to an independent lapse rate.

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) state; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != stim.shape[1]:
        raise ValueError("Length of validities must match n_features.")
        
    # Transform validities into log-odds to correctly accumulate probabilistic evidence
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 1e-5, 1.0 - 1e-5)
    w = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features for each option
    scores = np.dot(stim, w)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.6, 0.55, 0.51]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To cleanly dissociate WADD (Weighted Additive Model) from Tallying, we use a 5-feature design with a steep distribution of validities. WADD integrates features by weighting them proportionally to their log-odds, allowing a single highly valid cue to outweigh several weak cues. Tallying, however, strictly counts the number of winning features for each option regardless of their validity. By pitting a single high-validity feature against multiple low-validity features, we create trials where WADD strongly prefers the option with the high-validity feature, while Tallying prefers the option with a greater quantity of winning features. We also include trials that reverse this polarity to ensure the dissociation holds symmetrically.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design pits WADD and Tallying against each other on every single trial. Specifically, the option that WADD prefers (due to high-validity features) is always the option that Tallying rejects (due to having fewer winning features). By computing the proportion of trials where the subject's choice aligns with the deterministic WADD prediction, we obtain a metric that will be very high (near 1.0) for subjects using WADD and very low (near 0.0) for subjects using Tallying.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.6, 0.55, 0.51]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Tallying from the Weighted Additive Model (WADD), we utilize a 5-feature design with a high variance in cue validities. WADD integrates features by weighting them according to their log-odds, allowing a single highly valid cue (e.g., 0.95) to completely override multiple lower-validity cues (e.g., 0.60, 0.55, 0.51). In contrast, Tallying simply counts the number of winning features for each option, treating all features equally regardless of validity. We construct trials where one option wins on a single high-validity feature while the other option wins on multiple low-validity features, leading to opposing predictions. We also include trials where Tallying predicts a tie (equal number of winning features) while WADD strongly prefers the option with the more valid features.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with Tallying rather than the Weighted Additive Model (WADD) on three critical trial types. On these trials, Tallying favors the option with more winning features regardless of validity, whereas WADD favors the option with fewer but highly valid features. The metric will yield a high value (close to 1) for Tallying-simulated data and a low value (close to 0) for WADD-simulated data, providing strong discrimination.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all experiments, the observed metrics consistently hover around 0.45 to 0.56, whereas Theory 1 (WADD) and Theory 2 (Tallying) consistently predict extreme values (e.g., > 0.8 or < 0.2) depending on whether the experimental design aligns with or opposes their deterministic logic. The real data shows that subjects are neither universally applying a compensatory strategy (WADD) nor universally applying a strict non-compensatory or counting strategy (Tallying or Take-The-Best). The fact that the observed choices sit squarely in the middle of these deterministic predictions on conflict trials strongly suggests a heterogeneous population where different subjects use different heuristics, or individuals probabilistically switch between strategies.",

Rather than assuming all subjects use a single deterministic strategy like Tallying or WADD, this theory should posit that the population consists of a mixture of decision-makers: some relying on compensatory integration (WADD), some on cue-counting (Tallying), and some on lexicographic rules (Take-The-Best). The model should implement a probabilistic mixture over these distinct strategies, allowing it to naturally predict intermediate metric values (~0.5) on trials where these heuristics make conflicting predictions, thereby capturing the aggregate population behavior much better than any single heuristic."
