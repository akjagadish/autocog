# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_6" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_6
Probabilistic Sequential Search Theory posits that decision-makers evaluate cues sequentially in order of their validity. Instead of adopting a strict stopping rule like Take-The-Best or exhaustively evaluating all cues like WADD, individuals accumulate evidence dynamically. When a cue discriminates between options, there is a constant probability (stop_rate) of stopping the search and deciding based on the accumulated evidence. This creates a flexible, cue-by-cue evidence accumulation process that naturally blends lexicographic and compensatory behaviors, explaining the softer choice probabilities and context-dependent trade-offs seen in human decision-making without forcing an overly aggressive stopping rule.

## THEORY 2 — pi_4
Strategy Mixture Theory with Independent Scaling: Individuals use a probabilistic mixture of distinct heuristics (WADD, Tallying, and Take-The-Best), but because the internal evidence scales of these heuristics vary dramatically (log-odds sums vs. integer counts vs. binary indicators), each heuristic applies its own independent temperature parameter to properly calibrate its choice probabilities before mixing.

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Probabilistic Sequential Search Theory (PSS) from Strategy Mixture Theory (SMT), we exploit PSS's step-by-step evidence accumulation mechanism versus SMT's fixed mixture of global heuristics (WADD, Tallying, TTB). In PSS, evidence is updated cue-by-cue, and the decision-maker can stop at any discriminating cue with a constant probability. This means that if early cues strongly favor one option, the accumulated evidence might remain in favor of that option at every possible stopping point, leading to a very high choice probability. In contrast, SMT computes the overall WADD and Tallying scores across all cues simultaneously. By designing trials where the first cue favors Option B, but subsequent cues favor Option A such that the running evidence sum in PSS only flips to Option A late in the sequence, PSS predicts a higher probability of choosing Option B (due to early stopping) than SMT, which sees a clear victory for Option A in both WADD and Tallying. We systematically vary the position and validities of the opposing cues to create a spectrum of divergences between early-stopping accumulation and global heuristic mixtures.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes the difference in the probability of choosing the option that is favored by the most valid cue (Cue 1) between two sets of trials. In Trials 1 and 2, the Cue 1 winner is opposed by all other cues, meaning WADD and Tallying strongly favor the opposite option. In Trials 3 and 4, the Cue 1 winner is also supported by WADD and Tallying. Strategy Mixture Theory predicts a large difference in choice probabilities here, because Trials 1 and 2 rely solely on the Take-The-Best heuristic to choose the Cue 1 winner, whereas Trials 3 and 4 have all heuristics aligned. Probabilistic Sequential Search, on the other hand, accumulates evidence step-by-step and may show a different magnitude of this alignment effect due to its early stopping mechanism.

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Strategy Mixture Theory (SMT) from Probabilistic Sequential Search (PSS), we exploit the fact that PSS always accumulates evidence using log-odds, whereas SMT includes a Tallying component that completely ignores cue weights. We design 'Tallying-dominant' trials where the first two highly valid cues favor Option A, but the remaining three weaker cues favor Option B. In PSS, the accumulated log-odds evidence heavily favors Option A at every single step of the sequential search; therefore, PSS must predict a near-deterministic choice for Option A regardless of its stopping rate parameter. However, SMT can predict a preference for Option B if the decision-maker places a high mixture weight on the Tallying heuristic (since B has 3 winning cues to A's 2). Conversely, we include 'Early-Stopping' trials where Option B wins the first cue, but Option A wins the next three cues such that the final WADD sum favors Option A. PSS with a high stop rate will frequently stop on the first or second cue and choose Option B, whereas SMT (which aggregates WADD and Tallying globally) will strongly favor Option A unless the TTB weight is overwhelmingly high.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times the decision-maker chooses the Take-The-Best (Cue 0) winner on 'Early-Stopping' trials (Trials 3 and 4). On these trials, the most valid cue favors one option (e.g., B), but the next three cues favor the other option (e.g., A), making A the winner by both WADD and Tallying. Probabilistic Sequential Search (PSS) evaluates cues sequentially. Because both Cue 0 and the cumulative evidence after Cue 1 favor Option B, any early stopping at the first or second cue will result in choosing Option B. This leads to a high predicted probability of choosing the TTB winner in PSS. In contrast, Strategy Mixture Theory (SMT) evaluates WADD, Tallying, and TTB globally and mixes them. Since two out of three heuristics strongly favor Option A, SMT will predict a much lower probability of choosing the TTB winner. This creates a large, robust mean difference between the two theories.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the 10 experiments, Theory 2 (Strategy Mixture Theory, pi_4) consistently outperforms Theory 1 (Probabilistic Sequential Search, pi_6) on the majority of the metrics (Experiments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10). However, Theory 2 fails substantially on Experiment 1, vastly overestimating the difference in choice probabilities when heuristics align versus when they conflict. Theory 1 captures Experiment 1 well but misses the mark on most other experiments. This suggests that while a mixture of heuristics (or at least the consideration of both simple tallies and weighted sums) is necessary to capture the broad patterns of human choices (as seen in Theory 2's success), the rigid global mixing of these strategies leads to exaggerated alignment effects. Theory 1's cue-by-cue sequential mechanism is too rigid in its accumulation, predicting extreme probabilities when early cues dominate, which isn't supported by the data. A new theory is needed to replace Theory 1, one that can dynamically switch or blend strategies based on the choice context rather than mixing them globally or relying on a strict sequential search.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Two-Stage Contingent Processing Theory'. In the first stage, decision-makers perform a rapid, parallel evaluation using a simple heuristic like Tallying (counting winning cues for each option). If the difference between the options in this first stage exceeds a certain threshold, a decision is made immediately based on this simple difference. If the options are too similar (below threshold), the decision-maker transitions to a second, more effortful stage, such as evaluating the options using weighted cues (WADD) or a strict lexicographic rule (Take-The-Best). This naturally limits the exaggerated alignment effects seen in Strategy Mixture Theory (since aligned trials might just be decided in Stage 1 with some noise, rather than summing up multiple confident heuristics) while capturing the context-dependent reliance on Tallying vs. weighted evidence across the other experiments."
