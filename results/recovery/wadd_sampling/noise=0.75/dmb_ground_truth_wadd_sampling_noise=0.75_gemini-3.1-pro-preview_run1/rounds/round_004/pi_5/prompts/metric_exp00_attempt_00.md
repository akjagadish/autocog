# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate High-Lapse Tallying from High-Lapse TTB, we exploit the fundamental difference in their core decision mechanisms while holding the assumption of a high lapse rate constant. High-Lapse Tallying relies on an unweighted sum of positive features, whereas High-Lapse TTB relies exclusively on the highest-validity discriminating cue. We construct trials that pit these two mechanisms directly against each other: in several trials, one option possesses the single most valid cue (favored by TTB) while the other option possesses a strictly greater total number of lower-validity cues (favored by Tallying). We also include trials where Tallying predicts a strict tie (equal number of positive features) but TTB predicts a clear preference based on validity rank.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** High-Lapse Tallying Theory: Subjects find the multi-attribute binary feature task cognitively demanding, leading to a very high rate of random guessing. However, when they do engage with the stimulus, they rely on a simple unweighted tally of positive features (Tallying) rather than integrating complex cue validities. This produces a very weak but non-zero behavioral signal that slightly favors options with a higher simple count of positive features.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.7, 1.0]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Unweighted tally of positive features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a)
    score_b = np.sum(b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over tallies for the engaged decision process
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Mix with a high lapse rate (random guessing)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** High-Lapse Take-The-Best (TTB) Theory: Subjects generally find the multi-attribute choice task tedious without trial-by-trial feedback, leading to a very high rate of random guessing (high lapse rate). However, on the small fraction of trials where they actively engage, they do not integrate all features or tally them. Instead, they use a fast-and-frugal lexicographic heuristic (Take-The-Best): they inspect cues in descending order of their validity and make a deterministic choice based entirely on the single most valid cue that discriminates between the two options.

**Parameters:**
- epsilon: [0.6, 1.0]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort cues by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(val)[::-1]
    
    ttb_choice = -1
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            ttb_choice = 0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            ttb_choice = 1
            break
            
    if ttb_choice == 0:
        p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif ttb_choice == 1:
        p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Mix the deterministic TTB choice with a high lapse rate (random guessing)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- metric: Python source defining def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this metric; used when interpreting results.


## Response

```json
{
  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    a_tallies = data['option_a_ratings'].apply(sum)\n    b_tallies = data['option_b_ratings'].apply(sum)\n    \n    diff_mask = a_tallies != b_tallies\n    data_diff = data[diff_mask]\n    \n    if len(data_diff) == 0:\n        return 0.5\n        \n    tally_pred = (b_tallies[diff_mask] > a_tallies[diff_mask]).astype(int)\n    match = (data_diff['response'] == tally_pred).mean()\n    \n    return float(match)",
  "rationale": "This metric calculates the proportion of choices that are consistent with the High-Lapse Tallying theory on trials where the two options have a different number of positive features. By experimental design, the trials where the tally differs (Trials 1, 2, 4, and 5) are constructed such that Take-The-Best (TTB) predicts the exact opposite choice of Tallying. Thus, data simulated under Tallying will yield a metric value > 0.5 (as the weak signal pushes choices towards the higher tally), whereas data simulated under TTB will yield a metric value < 0.5 (as its weak signal pushes choices towards the lower tally but higher validity cue). This structural opposition guarantees strong discrimination between the theories."
