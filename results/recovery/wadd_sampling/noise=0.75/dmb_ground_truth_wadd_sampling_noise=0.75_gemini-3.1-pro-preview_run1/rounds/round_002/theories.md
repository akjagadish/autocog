# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Generalized Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory: Decision-makers evaluate options by computing a compensatory weighted sum of their features. However, instead of using raw cue validities as weights, individuals scale the validities non-linearly using a parameter gamma. This scaling allows the decision process to smoothly interpolate between Tallying (gamma=0, where all cues are weighted equally), standard WADD (gamma=1), and Take The Best (gamma -> infinity, where the most valid cue dominates). The final choice is made probabilistically via a softmax function over the computed option values, mixed with a random lapse rate.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, a non-linear scaling parameter `gamma` has been introduced to the WADD model. Instead of using raw validities, the weights are computed as `validities ** gamma`. This allows the model to flexibly adjust the relative influence of the cues, smoothly interpolating between Tallying (gamma=0) and TTB (gamma -> infinity). This modification prevents the sum of weaker cues from systematically outweighing the best cue in ways inconsistent with human behavior, enabling the model to better capture the intermediate choice proportions observed in both experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != stim.shape[1]:
        raise ValueError("Length of validities must match number of features.")
        
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    weights = val ** gamma
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Calculate weighted sums for each option
    score_a = np.sum(weights * a)
    score_b = np.sum(weights * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over scores with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Random Guessing (Zero-Intelligence) Theory: Without trial-by-trial feedback, subjects find the multi-attribute binary feature task too cognitively demanding or unengaging. As a result, they do not attempt to integrate the cue validities or compare the feature values. Instead, they simply guess uniformly at random on every trial.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory replaces the previous heuristic models with a Zero-Intelligence Random Guessing model. Looking at the empirical data across all four experiments, the observed values are extremely close to 0.5 (Experiment 1: 0.47, Experiment 2: 0.54, Experiment 3: 0.48) and 0.0 for the difference metric in Experiment 4. Complex models like TTB, Tallying, and WADD produce extreme metric values (e.g., 0.85 or 0.15) that fail to capture this baseline behavior. By outputting exactly [0.5, 0.5] on every trial, this model accurately captures the empirical reality that subjects are, on average, guessing.

**Parameters:**
  (none)

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    # The model assumes pure random guessing, ignoring stimulus and history entirely.
    return np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** High-Lapse Tallying Theory: Subjects find the multi-attribute binary feature task cognitively demanding, leading to a very high rate of random guessing. However, when they do engage with the stimulus, they rely on a simple unweighted tally of positive features (Tallying) rather than integrating complex cue validities. This produces a very weak but non-zero behavioral signal that slightly favors options with a higher simple count of positive features.

**Rationale:** The arbiter noted that subjects exhibit a very weak but non-zero signal that aligns more with unweighted feature counts (Tallying) than with validity-weighted sums. The previous Random Guessing model captured the overall lack of signal but missed the subtle structure. By introducing a Noisy Tallying model with a high lapse rate (epsilon between 0.7 and 1.0), we can explain both the predominantly random behavior and the slight preference for options with more positive features observed in the data.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.7, 1.0]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Unweighted tally of positive features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a)
    score_b = np.sum(b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over tallies for the engaged decision process
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Mix with a high lapse rate (random guessing)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```
