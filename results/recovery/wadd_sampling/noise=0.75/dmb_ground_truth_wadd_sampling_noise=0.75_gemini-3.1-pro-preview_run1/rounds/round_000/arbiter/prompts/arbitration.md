# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design strictly dissociates Take The Best (TTB) from Tallying by pitting the highest-validity discriminating cue against the sheer number of winning cues. In each trial, one option wins on the most valid discriminating cue (thus chosen by TTB), while the other option wins on a strictly greater number of lower-validity cues (thus chosen by Tallying). By varying which cue is the highest discriminating one (1st, 2nd, or 3rd validities), we can thoroughly test whether subjects rely on a single reason or sum the features.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design pits Take The Best perfectly against Tallying: in every single trial, the option favored by the first discriminating cue (TTB) is opposed by the option with a higher sheer number of winning cues (Tallying). This metric simply computes the proportion of choices that align with the TTB prediction. Under TTB, this proportion will be high (approaching 1 depending on noise levels). Under Tallying, this proportion will be low (approaching 0), providing a maximal and highly stable contrast between the two theories.

- Predicted under pi_2 (simulated): 0.1516 (var=0.0131)
- Observed on real data: 0.4737 (var=0.0046)

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates Tallying from Take The Best (TTB) by systematically pitting the highest-validity discriminating cue against the unweighted sum of lower-validity cues. We use 5 features with strictly decreasing validities. In every trial, one option is favored by TTB because it wins on the single most predictive cue that discriminates the options, whereas the other option is favored by Tallying because it wins on a strictly greater number of lower-validity cues. By shifting which cue is the highest discriminating one (1st, 2nd, or 3rd validity) across trials, we can rule out alternative heuristics like simple weighting and confirm whether subjects are purely counting features (Tallying) or adopting a one-reason stopping rule (TTB).

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Calculates the proportion of trials where the participant's choice aligns with the Tallying heuristic. Because the experiment is designed such that Tallying and Take The Best make strictly opposing predictions on every trial, this metric will yield values close to 1 for data simulated under Tallying and close to 0 for data simulated under TTB.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Both experiments were designed to perfectly pit Take The Best (Theory 1) against Tallying (Theory 2). In both cases, the simulated predictions for the two theories were diametrically opposed (e.g., ~85% vs ~15%), but the observed data fell right in the middle (around 47-55%). This indicates that neither a pure one-reason decision rule (TTB) nor a pure unweighted counting rule (Tallying) captures human behavior. Subjects might be using a compensatory strategy that weighs cues by their validity (such as a Weighted Additive model), or there might be significant individual differences where half the subjects use TTB and half use Tallying. Because both current theories make extreme, deterministic predictions that fail to capture the near-chance aggregate behavior, a completely new theory is required.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. Unlike TTB (which completely ignores lower-validity cues) and Tallying (which ignores cue validities entirely), WADD assumes that decision-makers compute a weighted sum of the features for each option, where the weights are proportional to the cues' validities. This compensatory mechanism allows multiple weaker cues to outweigh a single strong cue depending on the exact validities, potentially predicting the intermediate choice proportions observed in the data."
