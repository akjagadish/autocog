# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=7):** [0.95, 0.92, 0.9, 0.88, 0.55, 0.55, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design isolates a critical qualitative dissociation between the Dual Process Strategy Mixture and WADD with subjective scaling. In key trials, Option A possesses the single highest-validity discriminating cue (causing TTB to favor A) AND a greater total number of winning cues (causing Tallying to favor A). Consequently, the Mixture model is strictly constrained to predict a preference for Option A. However, Option B is supported by multiple highly valid cues that are only marginally inferior to Option A's single top cue. Under WADD with a non-linear subjective validity scaling (e.g., gamma > 1), the combined weight of Option B's multiple strong cues surpasses Option A's single top cue and weak secondary cues, allowing WADD to predict a preference for Option B. This creates a scenario where the two theories predict choices in opposite directions.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory with Subjective Validity Scaling: People compare options by computing a comprehensive value for each option, integrating all available cues by weighting each feature. However, instead of using raw objective validities, individuals apply a non-linear subjective scaling to these validities. This scaling allows a single highly valid cue to be disproportionately weighted to balance out multiple less valid cues, gracefully explaining why individuals exhibit near-indifference (choice proportions around 0.5) when faced with adversarial choices where one option excels on the best cue but the other excels on numerous lesser cues. Response noise is captured via a softmax over the options' weighted sums, along with an independent lapse rate.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Dual Process Strategy Mixture: Decision-makers employ different strategies probabilistically. A proportion of choices are generated by a strict, non-compensatory 'Take-The-Best' (TTB) heuristic, while the remainder are generated by a compensatory 'Tallying' strategy. The Tallying component operates with softer inverse temperatures, preventing it from producing excessively extreme compensatory shifts when multiple weak cues oppose a strong one, while the TTB component operates with high determinism.

**Parameters:**
- w_ttb: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta_ttb: [5.0, 20.0]
- beta_tally: [0.1, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- metric: Python source defining def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this metric; used when interpreting results.


## Response

```json
{
  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    # Identify trials where Option A has >= 3 positive cues and Option B has exactly 2\n    a_sums = data['option_a_ratings'].apply(lambda x: sum(x))\n    b_sums = data['option_b_ratings'].apply(lambda x: sum(x))\n    \n    mask = (b_sums == 2) & (a_sums >= 3)\n    \n    if mask.sum() == 0:\n        return 0.0\n        \n    # Return the proportion of times Option B was chosen\n    return float(data.loc[mask, 'response'].mean())",
  "rationale": "This metric isolates trials where Option A has the single best cue AND a greater total number of positive cues than Option B (Trials 1-4). Under the Dual Process Strategy Mixture theory, both the Take-The-Best heuristic and the Tallying strategy unanimously favor Option A, constraining the model to predict an overwhelming preference for Option A (proportion of B choices near 0). Conversely, under the WADD theory with subjective validity scaling, a sufficiently large non-linear scaling parameter (gamma) causes Option B's multiple strong secondary cues to outweigh Option A's single top cue, leading to a substantial proportion of choices for Option B. Thus, measuring the choice proportion for Option B on these specific trials maximally discriminates the two theories."
