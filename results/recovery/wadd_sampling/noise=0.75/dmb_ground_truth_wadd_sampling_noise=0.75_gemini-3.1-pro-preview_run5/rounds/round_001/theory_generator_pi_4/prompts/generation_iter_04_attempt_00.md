# generation_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Propose a 'Strategy Mixture' or 'Dual Process' theory. The new theory should posit that decision-makers are heterogenous (or use different strategies on different trials): a proportion of choices are made using a strict non-compensatory heuristic like Take-The-Best, while the remainder are made using a compensatory integration strategy (like Tallying or WADD). This mixture would correctly predict a dampened but non-zero effect of opposing cues in Experiments 1 and 2, while successfully capturing the compensatory shifts seen in Experiments 3 and 4 that a pure TTB model completely misses.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.538)

**Description**
Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory with Subjective Validity Scaling: People compare options by computing a comprehensive value for each option, integrating all available cues by weighting each feature. However, instead of using raw objective validities, individuals apply a non-linear subjective scaling to these validities. This scaling allows a single highly valid cue to be disproportionately weighted to balance out multiple less valid cues, gracefully explaining why individuals exhibit near-indifference (choice proportions around 0.5) when faced with adversarial choices where one option excels on the best cue but the other excels on numerous lesser cues. Response noise is captured via a softmax over the options' weighted sums, along with an independent lapse rate.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.227)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1593 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1918 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.3020 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.1479 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 4 at loss=0.1479 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Dual Process Strategy Mixture: Decision-makers employ different strategies probabilistically. A proportion of choices are generated by a strict, non-compensatory 'Take-The-Best' (TTB) heuristic, while the remainder are generated by a compensatory 'Tallying' strategy. The Tallying component operates with softer inverse temperatures, preventing it from producing excessively extreme compensatory shifts when multiple weak cues oppose a strong one, while still allowing for baseline compensatory behaviors.

        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)

    for j in cue_order:

    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()

`parameters`:
- w_ttb: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta_ttb: [0.1, 20.0]
- beta_tally: [0.1, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the latest feedback, we restrict the parameter range of `beta_tally` to [0.1, 5.0] while keeping the core TTB + Tallying mixture from the best-performing base. This modification softens the probabilities generated by the Tallying strategy, preventing it from overpredicting the compensatory effect in Exps 3 and 4, while preserving the baseline compensatory balance needed for Exps 1 and 2.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model successfully implements the prescribed Dual Process Strategy Mixture, mixing Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying. This mechanism successfully moves the predictions in the right direction compared to a pure TTB model: it dampens the TTB reliance in Experiments 1 and 2, and it produces the non-zero compensatory shifts in Experiments 3 and 4. However, the model currently overestimates the compensatory shifts: in Exp 3 it predicts 0.1706 (observed: 0.0456) and in Exp 4 it predicts 0.1467 (observed: 0.0600). This suggests the Tallying component is exerting too much influence on the choice probabilities.
Rationale: The mixture framework is correct and was accepted by the gate, but the parameter ranges allow the Tallying strategy to over-predict the compensatory effect. To tighten the fit for Experiments 3 and 4 (where the true compensatory shifts are very small, 0.04-0.06), restrict the mixing weight `w_ttb` to heavily favor TTB. Change the range of `w_ttb` from [0.0, 1.0] to [0.5, 1.0] so the model is forced to treat TTB as the dominant strategy, and consider lowering the upper bound of `beta_tally` to prevent extreme compensatory probabilities. Keep the core mixture logic intact.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1593 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1918 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was REJECTED by the gate. While restricting the TTB weight to [0.5, 1.0] successfully reduced the overestimation of compensatory shifts in Experiments 3 and 4, it severely degraded the fit for Experiments 1 and 2. By forcing TTB to be too dominant, the model lost its ability to capture the baseline compensatory behavior observed in the first two experiments. The base model (iter 1) had a better overall balance but overestimated the compensatory effect in Exp 3 and 4.
Rationale: Since clamping the mixture weight ruined Experiments 1 and 2, we should revert to the iter 1 parameter ranges (w_ttb in [0.0, 1.0]) but change the nature of the compensatory strategy itself. The arbiter prescribed 'Tallying or WADD'. Currently, the model uses Tallying, which weights all cues equally. This causes overly strong compensatory shifts when multiple weak cues oppose a strong cue (Exp 3 and 4). Replace the 'Tallying' strategy with a 'WADD' (Weighted Additive) strategy, where the score for each option is the sum of the validities of the cues it possesses. This will naturally dampen the compensatory effect of weak cues while maintaining the correct balance for Experiments 1 and 2.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1918 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.3020 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was REJECTED by the gate. Replacing Tallying with WADD (Weighted Additive) actually worsened the overestimation of compensatory shifts in Experiments 3 and 4 (Exp 3: 0.25 vs real 0.04; Exp 4: 0.31 vs real 0.06). WADD amplifies the effect of multiple opposing cues if their validities are relatively high, leading to larger deviations from the non-compensatory baseline than Tallying did. The running-best base (iter 1) which uses TTB + Tallying remains the best approach so far, but we still need to solve the slight overestimation in Exp 3 and 4 without destroying the fit for Exp 1 and 2.
Rationale: Since the WADD replacement failed, the proposer will automatically build on the iter 1 base (TTB + Tallying). To reduce the overestimation of compensatory shifts in Exp 3 and 4 without forcing TTB to completely dominate (which ruined Exp 1 and 2 in iter 2), keep the TTB + Tallying mixture but restrict the upper bound of `beta_tally`. Set `beta_tally` to [0.1, 5.0] (instead of 20.0). This will 'soften' the Tallying strategy's probabilities, making it less extreme when multiple cues oppose the best cue, thus dampening the compensatory shifts in Exp 3 and 4 while still providing the necessary directional pull for Exp 1 and 2. Keep `w_ttb` in [0.0, 1.0].

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.3020 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.1479 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was ACCEPTED by the gate, achieving a new running-best loss of 0.1479. Restricting the upper bound of `beta_tally` to 5.0 successfully softened the Tallying strategy's predictions, improving the balance across all four experiments compared to the initial iteration. However, the model still overestimates the compensatory shifts in Experiments 3 and 4 (Exp 3: 0.1803 vs real 0.0456; Exp 4: 0.1233 vs real 0.0600). The Tallying component is still exerting slightly too much confident pull when multiple weak cues oppose the TTB winner.
Rationale: Since the previous adjustment to `beta_tally` was successful and ACCEPTED, we should push slightly further in the same direction to tighten the fit for Experiments 3 and 4. Keep the exact same TTB + Tallying mixture mechanism, but restrict the range of `beta_tally` even further to [0.1, 2.0] (down from 5.0). This will further flatten the probabilities generated by the compensatory strategy, reducing the magnitude of the compensatory shifts in Exp 3 and 4 toward the empirical ~0.05 level, while still allowing the mixture weight to calibrate the baseline performance in Exp 1 and 2.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.1479 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
