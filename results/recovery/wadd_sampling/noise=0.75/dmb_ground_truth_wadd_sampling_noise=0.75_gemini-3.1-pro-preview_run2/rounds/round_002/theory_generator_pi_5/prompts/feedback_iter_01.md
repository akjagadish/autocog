# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a new theory: 'Strategy Mixture of TTB and WADD'. Since the data consistently falls halfway between the predictions of a purely non-compensatory approach (TTB) and a purely compensatory approach with log-odds weighting (WADD), the new theory should posit that decision-makers draw from a repertoire containing both TTB and WADD. By using a mixture parameter to blend TTB (which selects the option with the highest valid cue) and WADD (which computes subjective value via log-odds weighted sums), this theory will naturally predict the intermediate (~0.50) choice proportions observed on conflict trials where TTB and WADD make opposite predictions.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Strategy Mixture of TTB and WADD with Normalized Scores: Decision-makers draw from a repertoire of strategies, mixing a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory one (Weighted Additive). To allow a consistent mixture and temperature scaling across experiments with varying numbers of cues, the WADD evidence values are normalized by the sum of the log-odds weights. This bounds the WADD scores between 0 and 1, matching the scale of the TTB evidence.

- beta_wadd: [0.01, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- p_ttb: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, we normalize the WADD scores by dividing them by the sum of the log-odds weights. This bounds the WADD scores to [0, 1], making them directly comparable in scale to the 0/1 TTB scores. Normalizing the scale allows the optimizer to find more stable temperature parameters across different experiments, preventing the model from under-predicting compensatory choices in setups with a larger number of cues like Experiments 2 and 3.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1628 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1794 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1628.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory successfully implements the Strategy Mixture of TTB and WADD and was accepted as the new running best. However, it still struggles with some experiments, particularly Experiment 2 (observed 0.5340, simulated 0.3016) and Experiment 3 (observed 0.5275, simulated 0.4092). In these experiments, the model heavily under-predicts the compensatory (WADD/Tallying) choices. This likely happens because the evidence scale for TTB (which is strictly 0 or 1) and WADD (which is the unnormalized sum of log-odds, capable of producing large or small absolute differences depending on the number of cues) are completely different. As a result, the optimizer struggles to find a single set of temperature parameters (beta_ttb and beta_wadd) and mixing weight (p_ttb) that balances the two strategies consistently across experiments with different numbers of features.
Rationale: Keep the prescribed TTB and WADD mixture family, but normalize the WADD scores so their scale is comparable to TTB. Specifically, divide the WADD scores (v_a and v_b) by the sum of the log-odds weights (np.sum(w)) before applying beta_wadd. This will bound the WADD scores between 0 and 1, matching the 0-1 scale of the TTB scores. This minor adjustment should allow the model to balance the two strategies more consistently across experiments with varying numbers of cues, improving the fits on Experiments 2 and 3.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1628 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1794 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate theory was rejected by the accept gate, meaning the previous advice to normalize the WADD scores by the sum of weights degraded the model's overall fit. By bounding the WADD scores between 0 and 1, the evidence differences between options were likely squashed too much, making the WADD predictions too noisy (closer to 0.5). This explains why the simulated metrics for Experiments 3, 4, and 5 dropped further below the observed values compared to Iteration 1. The model still under-predicts compensatory (WADD) choices, but normalization was not the right fix.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The previous attempt to normalize WADD scores was rejected by the gate, as it squashed the evidence differences and made WADD predictions too noisy. We should abandon the normalization and return to the unnormalized log-odds WADD sums. Instead of changing the evidence scale, we should give the optimizer more room to scale the temperatures. Widen the upper bounds of `beta_ttb` and `beta_wadd` significantly (e.g., from 10.0 to 50.0 or 100.0). This will allow the model to achieve sharper, more deterministic probabilities for both strategies when necessary, compensating for the unnormalized scale differences naturally through the separate beta parameters without destroying the relative distance between options."
