# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Strategy Mixture Theory: People do not rely exclusively on a single decision strategy. Instead, individuals or trials draw from a repertoire of strategies, specifically a mixture of a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory heuristic (Tallying). The probability of using TTB versus Tallying is governed by a mixture parameter, allowing the model to capture intermediate choice proportions on conflict trials where the two strategies make opposite predictions. Tallying treats all cues equally, ensuring it provides a genuine compensatory contrast to TTB.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the compensatory component of the mixture was changed from Weighted Additive (WADD) with log-odds weights to Tallying (equal weights). Log-odds weights for highly valid cues caused WADD to mimic the non-compensatory behavior of TTB, failing to capture the compensatory choices observed in Experiment 2. By using Tallying, the compensatory strategy genuinely conflicts with TTB on relevant trials, allowing the mixture parameter `p_ttb` to properly interpolate between heuristic and compensatory behavior and better match the aggregate empirical rates.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.01, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `p_ttb`: `[0.0, 1.0]`

```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People make decisions by computing a subjective value for each option through a Weighted Additive (WADD) process. They take a weighted sum of the features for each option, where the weight of each feature is the log-odds of its provided cue validity. This transformation appropriately scales probabilities into additive evidence. The probability of choosing an option is then determined by a softmax over the options' subjective values, combined with a lapse rate for random errors. This compensatory mechanism allows multiple lower-validity cues to jointly outweigh a single high-validity cue, naturally predicting the graded, intermediate behavior observed on conflict trials compared to non-compensatory heuristics like Take The Best or Tallying.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the raw cue validities (which are probabilities) are transformed into log-odds to correctly represent additive evidence in the WADD model. Additionally, the range of the beta parameter is shifted to lower values ([0.01, 5.0]) to soften the softmax output, preventing the overly extreme predictions seen previously and better matching the ~0.5 choice proportions observed empirically on conflict trials.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.01, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Transform validities to log-odds to represent additive evidence
    # Clip to avoid division by zero or log(0)
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 1e-5, 1.0 - 1e-5)
    w = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    
    # Compute weighted additive values for both options
    v_a = np.sum(a * w)
    v_b = np.sum(b * w)
    scores = np.array([v_a, v_b])

## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Strategy Mixture of TTB and WADD: Decision-makers draw from a repertoire of strategies, specifically mixing a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a fully compensatory one (Weighted Additive). By probabilistically blending TTB (which selects the option with the highest valid cue) and WADD (which computes subjective value via log-odds weighted sums of all cues), the model naturally predicts the intermediate choice proportions observed on conflict trials where the two strategies make opposite predictions.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's most recent feedback, the previous attempt to normalize WADD scores degraded the model's fit by squashing evidence differences and making WADD predictions too noisy. Instead of modifying the evidence scale, we revert to the unnormalized log-odds WADD sums from the running-best candidate and simply widen the upper bounds of `beta_ttb` and `beta_wadd` from 10.0 to 100.0. This gives the optimizer the freedom to scale the unnormalized WADD evidence and TTB evidence appropriately, allowing the model to achieve sharper, more deterministic probabilities for both strategies when necessary.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta_ttb`: `[0.01, 100.0]`
  - `beta_wadd`: `[0.01, 100.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `p_ttb`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
