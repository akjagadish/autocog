# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.98, 0.95, 0.55, 0.53, 0.51]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design provides a strict qualitative dissociation between the Rank-Weighted Additive Model and the Strategy Mixture (TTB + WADD) theory. We use a 5-feature design with two extremely high validities (0.98, 0.95) and three very low validities (0.55, 0.53, 0.51). Because WADD relies on log-odds transformations, the log-odds of the top two cues (~3.89 and ~2.94) overwhelmingly dominate the bottom three cues (~0.20, ~0.12, ~0.04). In our critical trials, Option A possesses the highest-validity cue(s) while Option B possesses a greater number of low-validity cues. Consequently, both TTB (which only looks at the top discriminating cue) and WADD (which sums the massive log-odds) will strictly and strongly prefer Option A. Thus, any mixture of TTB and WADD must predict a strong preference for Option A. However, the Rank-Weighted Additive Model completely ignores the magnitude of the log-odds gap, assigning weights based solely on ordinal rank (e.g., 1, 1/2^k, 1/3^k, etc.). For low-to-moderate values of the decay parameter 'k', the sum of the ranks for Option B's multiple cues will exceed the rank weight of Option A's top cue(s), allowing the Rank-Weighted model to predict a preference for Option B. This constitutes a definitive ordinal violation that the Mixture model cannot accommodate under any parameterization.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Rank-Weighted Additive Model: Decision-makers assign subjective weights to cues based on their ordinal rank of validity rather than transforming raw validities via log-odds. The weight of each cue decays as an inverse power function of its rank (e.g., 1 / rank^k). This compensatory approach preserves monotonicity and naturally dampens the extreme predictions of pure log-odds WADD, successfully explaining intermediate choice proportions and avoiding the ordinal violations typical of non-compensatory heuristics like Take The Best.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 3.0]
- decay_rate: [0.0, 2.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.3]

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Strategy Mixture of TTB and WADD: Decision-makers draw from a repertoire of strategies, specifically mixing a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a fully compensatory one (Weighted Additive). By probabilistically blending TTB (which selects the option with the highest valid cue) and WADD (which computes subjective value via log-odds weighted sums of all cues), the model naturally predicts the intermediate choice proportions observed on conflict trials where the two strategies make opposite predictions.

**Parameters:**
- beta_ttb: [0.01, 100.0]
- beta_wadd: [0.01, 100.0]

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- metric: Python source defining def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this metric; used when interpreting results.


## Response

```json
{
  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    # Identify target trials where Option A has exactly 1 positive rating (Trials 2 and 3)\n    is_target = data['option_a_ratings'].apply(lambda x: sum(x) == 1)\n    if not is_target.any():\n        return 0.0\n    # Return the proportion of times Option B was chosen in these trials\n    return float(data.loc[is_target, 'response'].mean())",
  "rationale": "In Trials 2 and 3, Option A possesses only a single cue (either the 1st or 2nd most valid), while Option B possesses multiple lower-validity cues. Both TTB and WADD overwhelmingly prefer Option A in these trials due to the massive gap in validities and log-odds. Consequently, the Strategy Mixture model must predict a near-zero probability of choosing Option B. However, the Rank-Weighted Additive Model uses ordinal ranks, allowing the sum of Option B's multiple lower-ranked cues to exceed Option A's single high-ranked cue for moderate decay rates. Thus, the proportion of 'Option B' choices on these specific trials will be significantly higher under the Rank-Weighted model compared to the Mixture model."
