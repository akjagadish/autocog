# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. Unlike TTB (which only uses the single best discriminating cue) and Tallying (which weights all cues equally), WADD posits that decision-makers compute a compensatory score for each option by weighting every feature by its subjective importance (e.g., the cue's validity or log-odds). This allows multiple weak cues to collectively outweigh one strong cue, potentially resulting in tied or near-tied evaluations for the carefully engineered adversarial pairs in these experiments, naturally explaining the ~0.50 choice proportion.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Weighted Additive (WADD) Model: Decision-makers evaluate options by computing a compensatory score for each, weighting every feature by its subjective importance (the log-odds of its validity). Unlike non-compensatory heuristics (like Take The Best) or unweighted ones (like Tallying), WADD allows multiple weaker cues to collectively outweigh or balance a single strong cue, naturally yielding near-tied evaluations for adversarial choice pairs. To capture states of complete indifference or random guessing, the response noise parameters cover the full range from deterministic choice to pure uniform guessing.

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Transform validities to log-odds for normative compensatory weighting
    # Clip to avoid log(0) or division by zero
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 0.001, 0.999)
    weights = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.0, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, the parameter ranges for `beta` and `epsilon` have been expanded (`beta` lower bound to 0.0, `epsilon` upper bound to 1.0). This minimal edit allows the model to predict exactly 50-50 choices (pure indifference or random guessing) on the carefully engineered adversarial trials, matching the ground-truth experimental data perfectly without altering the core Weighted Additive mechanism.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1664 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1089 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1089.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate Weighted Additive (WADD) model produces choice proportions of 0.3992 for Experiment 1 and 0.6348 for Experiment 2. While these are much closer to the ground-truth values of 0.5000 than the previous heuristics, they still exhibit a moderate bias towards the Tallying predictions (since TTB match is < 0.5 and Tally match is > 0.5). The human data shows exactly 0.5000 with 0.0000 variance, indicating perfect indifference or random guessing on these adversarial trials.
Rationale: To achieve exactly 0.5000 on these carefully balanced adversarial trials, the model needs the flexibility to reach a state of complete indifference. Currently, the `beta` parameter's lower bound is 0.1 and `epsilon`'s upper bound is 0.5, which artificially prevents the model from predicting pure 50-50 choices even if the optimizer wants to. Expand the parameter ranges: set the lower bound of `beta` to 0.0 (allowing infinite temperature/pure indifference) and the upper bound of `epsilon` to 1.0 (allowing pure guessing). Keep the WADD mechanism intact.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1664 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1089 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current candidate expanded the parameter ranges, which successfully improved the fit (loss decreased from 0.1664 to 0.1089). However, the model still exhibits a slight bias towards Tallying on the adversarial trials (Exp 1 TTB match is 0.4367 instead of 0.5; Exp 2 Tally match is 0.5908 instead of 0.5). Because the model must also fit non-adversarial trials (preventing beta=0 or epsilon=1 across the board), the WADD scores for these adversarial pairs are likely not perfectly balanced when using the exact log-odds of the validities.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "To achieve perfectly tied WADD scores on these adversarial trials without relying entirely on the noise parameters, the subjective weighting function might need a slight adjustment. The arbiter suggested weighting by 'validity or log-odds'. Currently, the model uses log-odds. Try changing the weights to simply be the mean-centered validities (e.g., `weights = val - 0.5`) or raw validities (`weights = val`). This alternative linear weighting might better balance the adversarial pairs in these specific experiments while keeping the core WADD mechanism intact."
