# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Extreme Spatial Bias / Key Perseveration: Subjects completely disengage from the multi-attribute decision task and instead adopt a deterministic response strategy. They choose the exact same option (either always Option A or always Option B) on every single trial, completely ignoring the stimuli and feature validities. The preference for Option A versus Option B is fixed per subject, creating a population split between 'Always-A' and 'Always-B' responders. At the individual level, the choice policy is entirely deterministic and repetitive.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, this model instantiates the 'Extreme Spatial Bias / Key Perseveration' theory. A pure random guessing model (pi_4) fails to capture the variance structure of the data, particularly in Experiment 6 where it yields a squared deviation of ~0.0 instead of 0.25. By assuming subjects are individually deterministic but perfectly split at the population level (50% Always-A, 50% Always-B), we perfectly recover the 0.5 accuracy metrics (since the experimental designs are balanced, always picking one option yields exactly 50% agreement with any balanced strategy like TTB or Tallying), the 0.0 differences in conditional probabilities, and the exact 0.25 squared deviation in Experiment 6 (since P(A) is 1.0 or 0.0 for each subject, yielding (1-0.5)^2 = 0.25 or (0-0.5)^2 = 0.25).

**Parameters:**
  - `preferred_option`: `{0, 1}`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    # The subject adopts a deterministic response strategy, always choosing the same option.
    pref = int(parameters["preferred_option"])
    if pref == 0:
        return np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    else:
        return np.array([0.0, 1.0])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Decision-makers use a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy, integrating all available features weighted by their validities, but they are subject to significant spatial/positional biases (e.g., a baseline preference for Option A over Option B) and high levels of task disengagement (lapse rate). In environments where subjects ignore features, the positional bias and lapse rate dominate the choice, leading to choices that appear completely orthogonal to standard heuristic predictions like TTB or Tallying (yielding exact 0.5 consistency).

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory implements a Weighted Additive (WADD) model that includes a strong spatial/positional bias ('bias_A') and a baseline lapse rate ('epsilon'). The experimental results show exactly 0.5 consistency with both TTB (Experiment 1) and Tallying (Experiment 2) with zero variance. This suggests subjects are either guessing randomly or exhibiting a strict side bias (clicking through), making their choices completely independent of the feature values. The inclusion of a wide-ranging side bias and lapse rate allows the model to capture this feature-ignoring behavior perfectly.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `bias_A`: `[-20.0, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Weighted Additive (WADD) scores
    score_a = np.sum(val * a)
    score_b = np.sum(val * b)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    bias_a = float(parameters["bias_A"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Incorporate spatial/positional bias for Option A
    logits = np.array([beta * score_a + bias_a, beta * score_b])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    logits = logits - np.max(logits)
    p_core = np.exp(logits) / np.sum(np.exp(logits))
    
    # Apply lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** First-Trial Inertia / Rational Disengagement: Subjects do not possess an innate spatial bias prior to the experiment. Instead, they actively evaluate the very first trial using a simple heuristic (like Tallying or Take-The-Best) to make an initial choice. However, due to the lack of trial-by-trial feedback and the repetitive nature of the multi-attribute stimuli, they rationally disengage after this first trial to minimize cognitive effort. For all subsequent trials, they exhibit 'first-trial inertia' by simply repeating their initial motor action. This produces 100% perseveration at the individual level, but grounds the origin of the bias in an initial stimulus-driven evaluation rather than an arbitrary trait.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's recommendation, this theory replaces the a priori spatial bias assumption of Theory 1 with a 'First-Trial Inertia' mechanism. Subjects evaluate the first trial using a simple heuristic (parameterized as either Tallying or Take-The-Best) to make a reasoned initial choice. Because the task provides no feedback and features are complex, they subsequently disengage and repeat this initial choice for the rest of the block. Since trial order is randomized, the first trial varies across subjects, leading to a natural ~50/50 split in the population between 'Always-A' and 'Always-B' responders. This maintains the perfect 100% perseveration fit observed in the metrics while providing a more plausible, stimulus-grounded mechanistic origin.

**Parameters:**
  - `heuristic_type`: `{0, 1}`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

        if heuristic_type == 0:
            # Tallying (equal weights)
            score_a = np.sum(a)
            score_b = np.sum(b)
