# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Take The Best (Gigerenzer & Goldstein 1996).
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current
    # trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B. Cue cascade: features are consulted in order
    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )
    # Descending validity; argsort is stable so validity ties break
    # toward the earlier feature index.
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break

    if winner is None:
        # No discriminating cue — pure guess.
        return np.ones(2) / 2.0

    scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. For the
    # binary TTB score this collapses to sigmoid(beta) for the winner,
    # giving a direct mapping from beta onto the paper's flip-noise
    # levels (beta=0 ↔ 50/50; beta ≫ 1 ↔ deterministic).
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Decision-makers use a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy, integrating all available features weighted by their validities, but they are subject to significant spatial/positional biases (e.g., a baseline preference for Option A over Option B) and high levels of task disengagement (lapse rate). In environments where subjects ignore features, the positional bias and lapse rate dominate the choice, leading to choices that appear completely orthogonal to standard heuristic predictions like TTB or Tallying (yielding exact 0.5 consistency).

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory implements a Weighted Additive (WADD) model that includes a strong spatial/positional bias ('bias_A') and a baseline lapse rate ('epsilon'). The experimental results show exactly 0.5 consistency with both TTB (Experiment 1) and Tallying (Experiment 2) with zero variance. This suggests subjects are either guessing randomly or exhibiting a strict side bias (clicking through), making their choices completely independent of the feature values. The inclusion of a wide-ranging side bias and lapse rate allows the model to capture this feature-ignoring behavior perfectly.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `bias_A`: `[-20.0, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Weighted Additive (WADD) scores
    score_a = np.sum(val * a)
    score_b = np.sum(val * b)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    bias_a = float(parameters["bias_A"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Incorporate spatial/positional bias for Option A
    logits = np.array([beta * score_a + bias_a, beta * score_b])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    logits = logits - np.max(logits)
    p_core = np.exp(logits) / np.sum(np.exp(logits))
    
    # Apply lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Subjects exhibit complete disengagement from the multi-attribute decision task. Rather than evaluating the options based on their features and the validities of those features, subjects ignore all stimulus information and simply guess at random on every trial, choosing Option A or Option B with equal probability.

**Rationale:** The arbiter feedback highlights that the observed experimental data perfectly aligns with random guessing across all experiments. The metrics for TTB agreement, Tallying agreement, and WADD/TTB divergence all center exactly on 0.5, while the difference in choice probabilities between symmetrical trials in Experiment 4 is exactly 0.0. This indicates that subjects are not using any systematic feature-based decision strategy, but are instead completely disengaged and flipping a coin for each choice. This Random Guessing model implements this by always returning a uniform probability distribution over the options, which perfectly matches the observed data without requiring any free parameters.

**Parameters:**
  (none)

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    # The model completely ignores the state and history, 
    # reflecting total task disengagement.
    return np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```
