# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Strong Position Bias / Constant Choice: Due to the lack of trial-by-trial feedback and low engagement, subjects adopt a degenerate strategy of always choosing the same option (e.g., always Option A or always Option B) regardless of the cues. This leads to choice probabilities of 1.0 or 0.0 for a given subject across all trials, perfectly explaining the near-zero within-subject variance across trial types and the extreme choice probabilities observed.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    # The subject has a strict preference for either Option A (0) or Option B (1)
    pref = int(parameters["preferred_option"])
    
    if pref == 0:
        return np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    else:
        return np.array([0.0, 1.0])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Mixture of Constant Choice and Take-The-Best: Subjects primarily exhibit a degenerate strategy of relying on a fixed position preference (always choosing Option A or always Option B) due to low engagement or lack of trial-by-trial feedback. However, on a small fraction of trials, they lapse into using a single-cue heuristic (Take-The-Best), where they compare the options on the most valid cue. This mixture maintains the near-zero variance in choice proportions across most experiments while capturing the slight preference for TTB over Tallying in disagreement trials.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

    p_const = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if pref == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    
    # Take-The-Best (TTB) prediction
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    ttb_pred = -1

    elif ttb_pred == 1:
        p_ttb = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        p_ttb = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_const + epsilon * p_ttb

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To dissociate the pure Strong Position Bias theory from the Mixture of Constant Choice and Take-The-Best (TTB) theory, we systematically vary the option favored by TTB. The pure Position Bias theory predicts that choice probabilities will be strictly 1.0 or 0.0 for a given option across all trials, completely invariant to the stimulus. The Mixture theory, however, predicts a small but systematic deviation (epsilon) toward the TTB prediction. By including trials where TTB strongly favors Option A, trials where TTB strongly favors Option B, and trials where TTB predicts a tie (identical features), we can detect whether the choice probability fluctuates in alignment with the TTB winner.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes the within-subject difference in the probability of choosing Option B between trials where Take-The-Best (TTB) favors Option B and trials where TTB favors Option A. Under the pure Strong Position Bias theory, this difference will be exactly zero for all subjects, as they completely ignore the stimuli. Under the Mixture theory, subjects will exhibit a slight shift in choice probability aligned with the TTB prediction, resulting in a strictly positive difference (equal to epsilon) on average.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_6)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To robustly dissociate the Mixture of Constant Choice and Take-The-Best (TTB) theory from the pure Strong Position Bias theory, this design introduces trials where TTB strictly opposes feature-summing strategies (Tallying/WADD), alongside trials where TTB predicts a tie (identical options). The pure Position Bias model predicts rigidly constant choices (100% A or 100% B) across all trials, completely ignoring the stimulus. In contrast, the Mixture theory predicts that choice probabilities will systematically deviate from the preferred option in the exact direction of the TTB prediction. By heavily pitting TTB against Tallying, we ensure that any deviations from pure constant choice are specifically driven by single-cue TTB lapses rather than general evidence-summing lapses.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
To discriminate between the Mixture of Constant Choice + Take-The-Best (TTB) and the pure Strong Position Bias theory, this metric specifically isolates trials where a subject deviates from their modal (preferred) choice. Under Strong Position Bias, subjects never deviate from their preferred option, so this metric will be exactly 0.0 with zero variance. Under the Mixture theory, subjects occasionally lapse from their preferred option, and these deviations are systematically driven by the TTB heuristic. The metric counts the proportion of trials where a deviation from the subject's mode perfectly aligns with the TTB prediction, yielding a strictly positive value exclusively for the Mixture theory.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all 10 experiments, the observed data overwhelmingly supports the Strong Position Bias / Constant Choice theory (THEORY 1). Metrics that measure within-subject variance or deviation from a constant choice perfectly yield 0.0000 on the real data (e.g., Experiments 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10). This completely invalidates the Mixture theory (THEORY 2), which predicts small but systematic deviations driven by the Take-The-Best heuristic and non-zero within-subject variance. The only experiment where the observed metric deviated from 0.5 for THEORY 1 was Experiment 4 (observed 0.4400, predicted 0.5333). This deviation in Experiment 4 can be explained by a simple population-level bias towards Option B, rather than a mixture of heuristics.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Biased Constant Choice' theory. Like Theory 1, it should posit that subjects completely ignore the stimuli and choose a single option (A or B) constantly across all trials, resulting in zero within-subject variance. However, unlike Theory 1 which assumes a symmetric 50/50 split in the population's preferred option, this new theory should allow for a population-level bias (e.g., a higher probability of preferring Option B over Option A). This will preserve the perfect 0.0000 predictions for within-subject variance and deviation metrics, while better capturing the slight shift away from 0.5 in unbalanced designs like Experiment 4."
