# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Strategy Mixture (TTB + Tallying): Decision makers do not universally adhere to a single strategy. Instead, they use a probabilistic mixture of a non-compensatory strategy (Take The Best) and a compensatory strategy (Tallying). A parameter P_TTB dictates the probability of using TTB on any given trial, while 1 - P_TTB is the probability of using Tallying. This accounts for intermediate levels of TTB-consistency and Tallying-consistency observed in empirical data across subjects and trials. The mixture captures a balance between TTB and Tallying, avoiding over-reliance on uniform guessing.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the minimal edit adjusts the `p_ttb` range to `[0.35, 0.95]` to perfectly split the difference between the previous two iterations. This should balance the slight over- and under-predictions of TTB consistency across the four experiments while keeping epsilon noise low.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `p_ttb`: `[0.35, 0.95]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.2]`

```


### slot 2 — `pi_5` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Probabilistic Cue Selection (Random Dictator): Decision-makers do not deterministically follow a strict cue hierarchy (as in Take The Best) nor do they exhaustively sum all available cues (as in Tallying or WADD). Instead, on any given trial, they probabilistically sample a single cue from the set of discriminating cues to determine their choice. The probability of sampling a specific cue is proportional to its validity raised to a non-linear scaling parameter (gamma). If gamma is very high, the most valid cue is almost always sampled, perfectly mimicking TTB. If gamma is near zero, cues are sampled uniformly, producing a soft Tallying-like behavior where choice probability reflects the proportion of cues favoring an option. This provides a mathematically elegant, single-process probabilistic mechanism that gracefully spans the spectrum of non-compensatory to compensatory decision-making without requiring ad-hoc response noise or explicit strategy mixtures.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's guidance, this model replaces the previous WADD/mixture theories with a Probabilistic Cue Selection mechanism. By isolating discriminating cues and sampling one proportional to a power of its validity (gamma), the model directly generates probabilistic choice predictions without needing an external softmax function. This elegantly captures the variance in human decision-making: high gamma subjects behave like strict TTB users, while low gamma subjects exhibit compensatory-like behavior proportional to the cue tally. This avoids the mechanistic failures of summing scores and produces a more natural, psychologically plausible account of bounded rational choice.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Identify cues that discriminate between option A and option B
    diff = a - b
    disc_mask = diff != 0
    
    if not np.any(disc_mask):
        # No cues discriminate; guess uniformly
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        # Scale validities of discriminating cues non-linearly

## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Weighted Additive with Diminishing Returns (WADD-DR): Decision-makers integrate all available discriminating cues but apply a sub-additive (concave) transformation to the accumulated evidence. Cue validities are first scaled non-linearly to reflect subjective weighting. Then, the total accumulated evidence for each option undergoes a concave transformation before being converted to choice probabilities. This naturally accounts for the dilution effect when multiple weaker cues are added, pulling choice probabilities toward 0.5, while maintaining sensitivity to the overall balance of evidence.

**Rationale:** Constrain epsilon to [0.0, 0.1] and beta to [0.1, 10.0]. Initial logic and parameters are validated. The model previously relied on high noise to minimize aggregate error, flatlining predictions. Bypassing intermediate tuning, we directly restrict the noise bounds. Standard processing applied. This enforces structural reliance on the WADD-DR mechanism.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 30.0]`
  - `alpha`: `[0.01, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.1]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np

    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Scale validities: subtract 0.5 so a random cue provides 0 evidence, then apply non-linear scaling
    w = np.maximum(0.0, val - 0.5) ** gamma
    
    # Accumulate evidence for each option based on discriminating cues
    diff = a - b
    ev_a = np.sum(w[diff > 0])
    ev_b = np.sum(w[diff < 0])
    
    # Apply sub-additive (concave) transformation to accumulated evidence
    # alpha < 1 yields diminishing returns for additional evidence
    ev_a_trans = (ev_a + 1e-9) ** alpha
    ev_b_trans = (ev_b + 1e-9) ** alpha
    
    # Convert transformed evidence to choice probabilities via softmax
