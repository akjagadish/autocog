# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_4" and "pi_3") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_4
Strategy Mixture (TTB + Tallying): Decision makers do not universally adhere to a single strategy. Instead, they use a probabilistic mixture of a non-compensatory strategy (Take The Best) and a compensatory strategy (Tallying). A parameter P_TTB dictates the probability of using TTB on any given trial, while 1 - P_TTB is the probability of using Tallying. This accounts for intermediate levels of TTB-consistency and Tallying-consistency observed in empirical data across subjects and trials. The mixture captures a balance between TTB and Tallying, avoiding over-reliance on uniform guessing.

## THEORY 2 — pi_3
Weighted Additive (WADD) theory with Non-Linear Cue Scaling posits that decision makers compute a total score for each option by summing the validities of the features it possesses, but they may non-linearly amplify or dampen the differences between cue validities. By exponentiating cue validities with a free parameter, the model can naturally interpolate between Tallying (where all cues are weighted equally) and Take The Best (where the highest-validity cue dominates).

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_4)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Strategy Mixture (TTB + Tallying) model from the WADD model with Non-Linear Cue Scaling, this design exploits the 'invariance' of the Mixture model to lower-validity cue permutations. In the Strategy Mixture model, as long as the TTB prediction (based on the highest discriminating cue) and the Tallying prediction (the simple count of winning cues) remain constant, the predicted choice probabilities are identical. By creating a sequence of trials (e.g., Trials 1-3) where Option A always wins the highest validity cue and Option B always wins 3 out of the 5 cues, the Strategy Mixture model predicts the exact same choice probabilities across these trials. However, the WADD model integrates the actual validities of the specific lower-tier cues. By shifting which specific lower-validity cues Option A vs. B wins across these trials, WADD predicts systematically shifting choice probabilities. We repeat this logic for trials where the first cue is tied, forcing TTB to rely on the second cue, again holding the Tallying ratio constant while altering the WADD score margins.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Under the Strategy Mixture model, the choice probability for Option A is identical across Trials 1 and 3, because Option A consistently wins the highest validity cue (TTB prediction) and Option B consistently wins 3 out of 5 cues (Tallying prediction). The same invariance holds for Trials 4 and 5. Therefore, the difference in P(A) between these paired trials should be near zero. In contrast, the WADD model integrates the varying validities of the specific lower-tier cues. In Trial 1, Option A's WADD score margin is less negative than in Trial 3, and similarly for Trial 5 vs Trial 4, leading to a systematically positive sum of differences in P(A).

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=7):** [0.96, 0.94, 0.92, 0.9, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**

  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design achieves a strict, parameter-free qualitative dissociation between the Strategy Mixture (TTB + Tallying) model and the WADD model with Non-Linear Cue Scaling. By carefully setting the validities and cue distributions, we create 'Adversarial' trials (e.g., Trial 1) where Option A possesses the single highest-validity cue (winning TTB) AND a larger total number of cues (winning Tallying). Because both sub-strategies of the Mixture model prefer Option A, the Mixture model is mathematically forced to predict a preference for A. However, Option B possesses a concentrated coalition of slightly lower but still highly valid cues. Across the entire allowed parameter space for WADD (gamma in [1.0, 20.0]), the exponentiated sum of Option B's coalition strictly outweighs Option A's single best cue plus its low-validity 'garbage' cues. Thus, WADD deterministically predicts a preference for Option B, while the Strategy Mixture deterministically predicts a preference for Option A. We include inverted versions and crossover trials to fully map the parameter space and rule out alternative heuristics.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Previous metrics failed because they incorrectly grouped trials that did not actually form equivalence classes under the Strategy Mixture model (e.g., Trial 3 is a tie under Tallying, while Trial 1 is a win for Option A, meaning Mixture does NOT predict identical probabilities for them). By restricting the analysis to the TRUE equivalence classes (Trial 1 vs Trial 7, and Trial 2 vs Trial 8), the Strategy Mixture model strictly predicts an expected difference of exactly zero. We then use a split-half cross-product to compute an unbiased estimator of the squared probability difference. This completely eliminates binomial noise bias, resulting in a tight distribution around 0 for the Strategy Mixture model, while WADD yields a robustly positive score due to its sensitivity to specific lower-tier cue validities.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Theory 1 (Strategy Mixture) performs remarkably well across almost all experiments. It correctly predicts the near-zero difference in Experiment 2 and closely matches the empirical observations in Experiments 3 and 5. Theory 2 (WADD with Non-Linear Cue Scaling) fails drastically on Experiments 2 and 5, predicting extreme values that strongly contradict the empirical data. Because Theory 1 is so dominant and Theory 2's core assumption of exponentiated compensatory summation leads to deterministic failures in adversarial designs, Theory 2 should be replaced entirely to provide a stronger competitor.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Probabilistic Cue Selection' (or Random Dictator) theory. Instead of assuming a strict cue order (as in pure TTB) or summing all cues (as in WADD or Tallying), this theory posits that decision-makers probabilistically sample a single cue on each trial. The probability of sampling a particular cue is proportional to its validity (or a non-linear transformation of its validity). If the sampled cue discriminates between the options, it determines the choice; if it ties, the decision-maker either samples another cue or guesses. This provides a natural, single-process probabilistic mechanism that can mimic both TTB-like and Tallying-like behavior without explicitly mixing two distinct strategies, offering a mathematically elegant alternative to Theory 1."
