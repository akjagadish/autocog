# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_14`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_13`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_14`).

Propose a 'Sequential Cue Evaluation with Probabilistic Stopping' theory. Subjects evaluate cues in descending order of validity. Upon finding a discriminating cue, they have a probability 'p_stop' (which may depend on the cue's validity) of terminating the search and choosing the favored option. If they do not stop, they continue accumulating evidence from subsequent cues. This naturally blends TTB-like behavior (frequent early stopping) with Tallying/WADD-like behavior (continued integration), explaining the partial variance in Exp 1 and the attenuated differences in Exp 2 without the rigid extremes of the current theories.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

**Description**
Conflict-Driven Strategy Selection: Decision-makers adaptively select their decision strategy based on the dissimilarity of the options' total cue counts. When options are highly dissimilar in the number of positive cues (indicating high conflict or complexity), individuals abandon compensatory processing and fall back entirely on a simple non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best). Conversely, when the total cue counts are similar, individuals attempt to integrate all available information using a compensatory strategy (Tallying). This is modeled as a probabilistic mixture of TTB and Tallying, where the probability of using TTB scales directly with the absolute difference in total cue counts.

### `pi_12` (overall score: 0.412)

**Description**
Context-Dependent Strategy Selection with Reverse TTB (Bottom-Up Heuristic): Decision-makers adapt their decision strategy based on the overall equality of evidence. When the total number of positive cues is unequal, they rely on a mixture of Tallying and standard Take-The-Best (evaluating from most to least valid). However, when options present a tied sum of positive cues, it triggers a 'Bottom-Up' or 'Reverse TTB' heuristic. In this mode, subjects evaluate cues starting from the least valid to the most valid, resolving the tie by favoring the option that possesses discriminating lower-validity cues. This naturally explains the paradoxical avoidance of the highest-validity cue in tied-sum scenarios, as the highest-validity cue is evaluated last and is thus overridden by differences in the lower-validity cues.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.385)

**Description**
Recency-Biased Evidence Accumulation: Decision-makers process cue arrays sequentially (e.g., from left to right) and exhibit a recency or primacy effect, largely overriding instructed objective validities. The subjective weight of a cue grows or shrinks exponentially with its position in the sequence. By framing this exponential growth/decay factor on a log scale, the population symmetrically exhibits both strong primacy and extreme recency, allowing the model to capture diverse behavioral patterns across different experimental contexts.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.4276 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4276 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Sequential Cue Evaluation with Probabilistic Stopping: Decision-makers evaluate cues sequentially in descending order of validity. Upon finding a discriminating cue, they stop with a certain probability and choose based on accumulated evidence. If they continue, they integrate further cues, naturally blending non-compensatory (TTB) and compensatory (Tallying/WADD) behaviors.

- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- kappa: [0.0, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's feedback, we introduce the Sequential Cue Evaluation with Probabilistic Stopping model. Instead of positing rigid strategy selection (e.g., entirely TTB or entirely Tallying), subjects evaluate cues sequentially in descending order of validity. When encountering a discriminating cue, they stop with probability `p_stop` and make a decision based on the accumulated evidence up to that point. If they do not stop, they continue to integrate evidence from subsequent cues. The evidence itself is weighted by the cue's validity raised to a parameter `kappa`, allowing the accumulation process to range from simple Tallying (`kappa=0`) to weighted additive processing (WADD, `kappa>0`). By marginalizing over all possible stopping points, we compute the exact expected choice probabilities. This formulation elegantly unifies TTB (high `p_stop`), Tallying (low `p_stop`, `kappa=0`), and WADD (low `p_stop`, `kappa>0`) within a single generative mechanism, capturing the nuanced partial variance across experiments.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory implements the arbiter's prescribed Sequential Cue Evaluation with Probabilistic Stopping mechanism and successfully achieves a new best aggregate loss (ACCEPTED). It captures the partial variance well in Experiments 1-5. However, it severely mispredicts several experiments where it overestimates TTB-like behavior (e.g., Exp 13, 14, 17, where predictions are ~0.8 vs observed ~0.2-0.3) and misses the direction in Exp 11 and 12. Currently, the probability of stopping `p_stop` is a constant across all cues. As a result, the model stops too frequently on later, lower-validity cues, artificially inflating non-compensatory choices when early cues are tied.
Rationale: While the candidate was accepted and is a great step forward, it still misses several experiments by overestimating early-stopping behavior. To fix this within the prescribed mechanism family, follow the arbiter's hint: make the stopping probability depend on the cue's validity. Replace the constant `p_stop` with a function of validity, such as `p_s = p_stop_base * (val[j] ** gamma)` (where `gamma` is a new parameter, e.g., in [0.0, 5.0]), or simply `p_s = p_stop * val[j]`. This will allow the model to stop frequently for highly valid cues but continue integrating for lower-validity cues, which should resolve the overestimation in Experiments 13, 14, and 17, and better capture the directional shifts in Experiments 11 and 12.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4276 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

Instead of a constant stopping probability `p_stop`, the probability of stopping `p_s` now depends on the cue's validity via `p_stop_base * (val[j] ** gamma)`. This allows the model to stop frequently for highly valid cues (mimicking TTB behavior) but continue integrating evidence when encountering lower-validity cues (mimicking Tallying/WADD behavior). This targeted change is expected to resolve the overestimation of early-stopping behavior in experiments with tied early cues and correctly capture the directional shifts in the corresponding experimental metrics."
