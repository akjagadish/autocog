# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_17" and "pi_15") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_17" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_15" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_17
Lateral Inhibition Evidence Accumulator (Extreme Dilution): Subjects evaluate options by comparing their feature vectors holistically, where the evidence provided by each cue is dynamically suppressed by other active cues via divisive normalization (lateral inhibition). Supporting secondary cues dilute the perceived value of the primary cue (self-inhibition), while conflicting cues from the alternative option also suppress evidence. This non-linear squashing before integration naturally produces strong non-monotonic and 'perverse' effects, where having too many secondary cues can paradoxically weaken an option's overall appeal compared to an option with a single strong primary cue.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_17)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.65, 0.6, 0.55, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the Lateral Inhibition Evidence Accumulator (Advocated) from the Probabilistic Strategy Mixture (Competing) by exploiting the Advocated model's 'perverse' self-dilution effect and the Competing model's structural invariance to symmetric evidence addition. In the Competing model, choice probability is a mixture of TTB (based on the highest validity cue) and Tallying (based on the absolute difference in cue counts). If we hold Option B constant and add lower-validity cues to Option A, the Competing model predicts that Option A's choice probability must strictly increase (or asymptote) because the Tallying advantage grows while the TTB winner remains A. However, the Advocated model features divisive normalization: adding secondary cues to Option A dilutes the perceived value of its primary cue. If this self-inhibition is strong enough, adding supporting cues to A can paradoxically *decrease* its overall choice probability. Furthermore, by symmetrically adding cues to both A and B, the Competing model predicts perfectly constant choice probabilities (since the TTB winner and Tally difference are unchanged), whereas the Advocated model predicts a systematic shift toward 0.5 due to mutual dilution and conflict suppression.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes the change in the probability of choosing Option B when secondary cues are added to the options. Under the Competing theory (Probabilistic Strategy Mixture), adding supporting cues to Option A increases its Tallying value, making Option A more likely to be chosen (and Option B less likely), resulting in a negative difference. Under the Advocated theory (Lateral Inhibition), adding secondary cues to Option A causes divisive normalization, diluting the impact of its primary, highest-validity cue. This 'perverse' self-dilution effect can paradoxically decrease the probability of choosing Option A, making Option B more likely, resulting in a positive difference. Combining the differences across Trial 1 -> 3 and Trial 4 -> 7 amplifies the contrast while smoothing single-trial variance.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_15)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the Probabilistic Strategy Mixture (Advocated) from the Lateral Inhibition Evidence Accumulator (Competing) by exploiting the Advocated model's structural invariance to symmetric evidence addition. In the Advocated model, choice probability is a mixture of TTB (based on the single highest-validity discriminating cue) and Tallying (based on the absolute difference in total winning cues). By systematically adding pairs of lower-validity cues to both options across trials, we hold both the TTB winner and the tally difference strictly constant. The Advocated model is mathematically forced to predict identical choice probabilities across these trial blocks. In stark contrast, the Competing model features divisive normalization (lateral inhibition). Adding secondary cues to an option dilutes the perceived value of its primary cue (self-inhibition) and suppresses the alternative option (conflict suppression). Consequently, the Competing model predicts systematic shifts in choice probability as more cues are added, breaking the invariance.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the difference in the probability of choosing the option with the highest validity cue (Cue 0) between trials where both options have 1 cue versus trials where both options have 3 cues. Under the Advocated theory (Probabilistic Strategy Mixture), adding symmetric secondary cues to both options changes neither the Take-The-Best winner nor the Tallying difference, so the choice probability should be perfectly invariant (metric ≈ 0). Under the Competing theory (Lateral Inhibition), adding secondary cues suppresses the perceived value of the primary cue via divisive normalization, causing the probability of choosing Cue 0 to drop significantly in the 3-cue trials (metric > 0).

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Experiment 1 strongly supports the 'perverse' dilution effect predicted by THEORY 1 (pi_17), where adding supporting but weaker cues to an option paradoxically decreases its choice probability. THEORY 2 (pi_15) fails catastrophically here, predicting the exact opposite. However, in Experiment 2, symmetric addition of cues leads to invariant choice probabilities, which THEORY 2 perfectly captures due to its reliance on strict cue-wise differences (Tallying/TTB), whereas THEORY 1 predicts a shift due to its global divisive normalization. Across the broader experimental set (e.g., Exps 13, 14, 31, 32), THEORY 2 frequently predicts the wrong direction of the effect, while THEORY 1 captures the direction but often misses the exact magnitude or structural invariances. A new theory is needed that can reconcile the strong dilution/averaging effects seen when asymmetric cues are added (Exp 1) with the invariance observed when symmetric cues are added (Exp 2).",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Feature-Averaging with Cue-wise Cancellation' theory. This theory should posit that subjects first cancel out shared or symmetric features between the options (explaining the invariance in Exp 2). After cancellation, the remaining unique features for each option are integrated not by summation, but by averaging their validities (or a similar capacity-limited normalization over *unique* features). This explains Exp 1: adding unique, lower-validity cues to Option A pulls down its average evidence, causing the perverse effect. By applying normalization only to the non-overlapping features, the model can simultaneously capture symmetric invariance and asymmetric dilution."
