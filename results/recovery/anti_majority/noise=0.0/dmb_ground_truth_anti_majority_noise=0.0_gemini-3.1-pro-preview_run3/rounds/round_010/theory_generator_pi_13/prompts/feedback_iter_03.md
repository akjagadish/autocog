# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_8`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_12`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_12`).

Propose a 'Weighted Additive with Non-linear Validity Scaling' (WADD-NL) theory. Instead of categorical strategy switching (e.g., TTB vs Tallying vs Reverse TTB), decision-makers integrate all available cues but weight them non-linearly based on their stated validities. For instance, the subjective weight of a cue could be an exponential or power function of its validity, allowing the model to naturally transition between TTB-like behavior (when the non-linearity is high, heavily favoring the best cue) and Tallying-like behavior (when the non-linearity is low), without hard thresholds or tied-sum triggers. This continuous integration approach will likely provide more robust and gradated choice probabilities across all experimental designs.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Weighted Additive with Softmax Validity Scaling (WADD-SOFTMAX): Decision-makers integrate all available cues but weight them exponentially based on their stated validities, with the weights normalized via a softmax function to sum to 1. A single parameter, gamma, controls the weighting distribution: positive values approximate Take-The-Best by heavily favoring the most valid cues, zero yields Tallying by weighting all cues equally, and negative values approximate Reverse TTB by favoring less valid cues. The softmax normalization provides a perfectly stable scale for the accumulated evidence, ensuring robust choice probability mappings across all experimental contexts.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Apply softmax weighting scheme to capture TTB, Tallying, and Reverse TTB
    # Normalizing weights to sum to 1 ensures a stable scale for accumulated evidence
    z_w = gamma * val
    e_w = np.exp(z_w - np.max(z_w))
    w = e_w / np.sum(e_w)
    
    # Accumulate evidence based on discriminating cues
    diff = a - b
    ev_a = np.sum(w[diff > 0])
    ev_b = np.sum(w[diff < 0])
    
    # Convert to choice probabilities via softmax
    scores = np.array([ev_a, ev_b])
    z = beta * scores
    e = np.exp(z - np.max(z))
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- gamma: [-20.0, 20.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, we implement a softmax normalization over the exponentially scaled validities. This bounds the weights so they sum to 1, providing a perfectly stable scale for the accumulated evidence regardless of the value of gamma (which can still be positive, zero, or negative to capture TTB, Tallying, and Reverse TTB). Because the maximum evidence difference is now bounded by 1.0, we expand the upper bound of the beta parameter to 50.0 to allow the model to make deterministic choices when necessary.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.5013 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.4408 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.5058 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4807 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.4408.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The WADD-NL candidate was accepted and establishes a solid baseline, but it struggles significantly on experiments designed to detect Reverse TTB-like behavior or negative weighting of high-validity cues (e.g., Exp 13, 14, 18, 19, where observed values are well below 0.5, but the candidate predicts > 0.8). The current power-function parameterization with `gamma >= 0` only allows interpolation between Tallying (gamma=0) and TTB (gamma>0). It cannot capture the empirical tendency of some subjects to down-weight or anti-weight the highest validity cues in tied-sum scenarios.
Rationale: To maintain the WADD-NL family while capturing the full empirical spectrum (TTB, Tallying, and Reverse TTB-like behaviors), revise the cue weighting function. Instead of a power function on shifted validities, use an exponential weighting scheme: `w = np.exp(gamma * val)`. Expand the range of `gamma` to allow negative values (e.g., `[-10.0, 10.0]`). When `gamma > 0`, the model will approximate TTB; when `gamma == 0`, it approximates Tallying; and critically, when `gamma < 0`, it will upweight lower-validity cues, naturally capturing the Reverse TTB-like patterns seen in Exps 13, 14, 18, and 19 without leaving the continuous-integration WADD family.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5013 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.4408 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The introduction of the exponential weighting scheme (WADD-EXP) successfully improved the aggregate loss by allowing the model to capture Reverse TTB-like patterns (e.g., Exps 13, 14, 18, 19) through negative gamma values. However, the model still exhibits significant deviations on several key experiments, notably Exps 1, 4, 8, and 9. The current formulation `w = np.exp(gamma * val)` means that because validities are bounded between 0.5 and 1.0, even non-predictive cues (val=0.5) are scaled dramatically when gamma is large. This lacks a principled baseline and likely contributes to the misfit and high variance in certain tasks.
Rationale: To improve the WADD-EXP model while staying strictly within the prescribed family, center the validities at chance level before applying the exponential scaling: use `w = np.exp(gamma * (val - 0.5))`. This ensures that a completely non-predictive cue (validity 0.5) always receives a baseline weight of 1 (since exp(0)=1), while predictive cues scale exponentially up or down relative to chance depending on gamma. Additionally, narrow the range of `gamma` to `[-10.0, 10.0]` to prevent the model from collapsing into overly extreme weight distributions, which should stabilize fits on Exps 8 and 9.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.4408 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.5058 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate (iter 3) was rejected by the accept gate, meaning the aggregate loss worsened compared to the iter 2 base. The attempt to center validities at 0.5 and remove max-normalization likely caused the absolute scale of the accumulated evidence to vary wildly depending on the value of gamma. Because the scores were no longer bounded, the beta parameter (temperature) could not stably map evidence differences to choice probabilities across the diverse experimental designs, leading to poor fits on experiments like 1, 4, 8, 9, and 15.
Rationale: Since the unnormalized centered exponential was rejected, we should return to the iter 2 base but implement a more robust normalization scheme. Specifically, apply a softmax function over the scaled validities: `w = np.exp(gamma * val) / np.sum(np.exp(gamma * val))`. This elegantly bounds the weights so they always sum to 1, providing a perfectly stable scale for the accumulated scores regardless of whether gamma is large, zero, or negative. Positive gamma will smoothly approach TTB, gamma=0 yields pure Tallying, and negative gamma captures Reverse TTB. Because the maximum possible score difference is now bounded by 1.0, you should expand the upper bound of the `beta` parameter (e.g., `[0.1, 50.0]`) so the model can still make deterministic predictions when needed.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.5058 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.4807 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current candidate (iter 4) was rejected by the accept gate, meaning the aggregate loss worsened compared to the iter 2 base. The attempt to use a softmax normalization over the cue weights squashed the evidence differences into a simplex, which likely distorted the relative distances between cues when gamma is moderate. This caused further degradation on experiments that rely on delicate evidence accumulation (Exps 1, 4, 9, 15), where the model's predictions drifted further away from human data compared to iter 2.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since the softmax weight normalization was rejected, we should return to the iter 2 base but implement a simpler, non-sum-constrained max-normalization to prevent overflow while preserving the raw relative distances of the exponential function. Specifically, compute the unnormalized log-weights `z = gamma * val`, and then simply anchor the maximum weight to 1.0 using `w = np.exp(z - np.max(z))`. Do NOT divide by the sum. This ensures the most favored cue (whether highest validity if gamma > 0, or lowest if gamma < 0) always has a weight of exactly 1.0, while the others decay exponentially. Keep the beta parameter's upper bound around 20.0 to allow for smooth probabilistic mapping without the evidence scale being artificially constrained by a sum-to-1 requirement."
