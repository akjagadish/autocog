# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_8" and "pi_12") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_8" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_12" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_8
Conflict-Driven Strategy Selection: Decision-makers adaptively select their decision strategy based on the dissimilarity of the options' total cue counts. When options are highly dissimilar in the number of positive cues (indicating high conflict or complexity), individuals abandon compensatory processing and fall back entirely on a simple non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best). Conversely, when the total cue counts are similar, individuals attempt to integrate all available information using a compensatory strategy (Tallying). This is modeled as a probabilistic mixture of TTB and Tallying, where the probability of using TTB scales directly with the absolute difference in total cue counts.

## THEORY 2 — pi_12
Context-Dependent Strategy Selection with Reverse TTB (Bottom-Up Heuristic): Decision-makers adapt their decision strategy based on the overall equality of evidence. When the total number of positive cues is unequal, they rely on a mixture of Tallying and standard Take-The-Best (evaluating from most to least valid). However, when options present a tied sum of positive cues, it triggers a 'Bottom-Up' or 'Reverse TTB' heuristic. In this mode, subjects evaluate cues starting from the least valid to the most valid, resolving the tie by favoring the option that possesses discriminating lower-validity cues. This naturally explains the paradoxical avoidance of the highest-validity cue in tied-sum scenarios, as the highest-validity cue is evaluated last and is thus overridden by differences in the lower-validity cues.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_8)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design provides a strict qualitative dissociation between the Conflict-Driven Strategy Selection (Advocated) model and the Context-Dependent Strategy Selection with Reverse TTB (Competing) model. The Advocated model relies on 'diff_cues' (absolute difference in total positive cues) to arbitrate between Take The Best (TTB) and Tallying. Critically, when diff_cues == 0, the Advocated model relies 100% on Tallying. Because the features are binary, any trial where sum(a) == sum(b) mathematically guarantees a tied Tallying score, forcing the Advocated model to predict exactly 50/50 regardless of the cues' validities. In contrast, the Competing model explicitly detects tied sums and boosts a 'Bottom-Up' (Reverse TTB) strategy, which evaluates cues from lowest to highest validity. For zero-conflict trials where Option A wins on the lowest-validity cue and Option B wins on the highest-validity cue, the Competing model will predict a preference for Option A, while the Advocated model is locked at 0.5. We also include high-conflict trials to map out the differential weighting of Standard TTB between the two models.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
On trials where the total number of positive cues is equal between Option A and Option B, the Advocated model (Conflict-Driven Strategy Selection) relies entirely on Tallying, which by definition results in a tie and forces a 50/50 random guess. The Competing model (Context-Dependent Strategy Selection) detects the tie and boosts a 'Bottom-Up' (Reverse TTB) strategy. In the specific experimental design provided, the tied trials (Trials 1 and 2) are structured such that Option A always possesses the lowest-validity cue. Therefore, the Competing model predicts a systematic preference for Option A on these trials, while the Advocated model predicts exactly 0.5. Measuring the proportion of Option A choices on tied-sum trials will cleanly discriminate the two models.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_12)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design provides a strict qualitative dissociation between the Context-Dependent Strategy Selection with Reverse TTB (Advocated) model and the Conflict-Driven Strategy Selection (Competing) model. The Competing model relies on 'diff_cues' (absolute difference in total positive cues) to arbitrate between Take The Best (TTB) and Tallying. Critically, when diff_cues == 0, the Competing model relies 100% on Tallying. Because the features are binary, any trial where sum(a) == sum(b) mathematically guarantees a tied Tallying score, forcing the Competing model to predict exactly 50/50 regardless of the cues' validities. In contrast, the Advocated model explicitly detects tied sums and boosts a 'Bottom-Up' (Reverse TTB) strategy, which evaluates cues from lowest to highest validity. For zero-conflict trials where Option A wins on the lowest-validity cue and Option B wins on the highest-validity cue, the Advocated model will predict a preference for Option A, while the Competing model is locked at 0.5. We also include high-conflict trials to map out the differential weighting of Standard TTB between the two models.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In trials where the sum of positive cues is equal between Option A and Option B, the Competing theory detects zero conflict (diff_cues = 0) and relies 100% on Tallying. Since the features are binary, equal sums mathematically guarantee a tied Tallying score, forcing the Competing theory to predict exactly a 50% chance of choosing Option A. Conversely, the Advocated theory detects the tied sums and boosts the 'Bottom-Up' (Reverse TTB) strategy. In the specifically designed tied-sum trials (Trials 1 and 2), the Bottom-Up strategy strictly favors Option A. Therefore, the proportion of times subjects choose Option A in tied-sum trials will be around 0.5 for the Competing theory, but significantly higher than 0.5 for the Advocated theory.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the experiments, both theories show significant gaps in explaining the observed data. In Experiment 1 and 2, THEORY 1 (Conflict-Driven) predicts exactly 0.50 due to its reliance on Tallying for tied sums, which is slightly closer to the observed values (0.405 and 0.568) than THEORY 2 (Reverse TTB), which drastically overshoots (0.80 and 0.82). However, in Experiments 16 and 21, THEORY 2 is much closer to the observed metrics. Furthermore, both models completely fail to capture the strong negative effects observed in Experiments 13 and 14, and underestimate the metrics in Experiments 10 and 11. The arbitrary categorical switching between TTB and Tallying, or the introduction of a 'Reverse TTB' heuristic, seems to create brittle predictions that fail to generalize across the continuous variation in cue validities and combinations.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Weighted Additive with Non-linear Validity Scaling' (WADD-NL) theory. Instead of categorical strategy switching (e.g., TTB vs Tallying vs Reverse TTB), decision-makers integrate all available cues but weight them non-linearly based on their stated validities. For instance, the subjective weight of a cue could be an exponential or power function of its validity, allowing the model to naturally transition between TTB-like behavior (when the non-linearity is high, heavily favoring the best cue) and Tallying-like behavior (when the non-linearity is low), without hard thresholds or tied-sum triggers. This continuous integration approach will likely provide more robust and gradated choice probabilities across all experimental designs."
