# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_19" and "pi_20") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_19" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_20" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_19
Decision-makers evaluate options based on the relative average validity of their active cues, rather than the simple sum. A base prior is included to prevent zero-division and establish a baseline expectation. This average-based integration naturally predicts the 'less-is-more' effect, as adding weak cues dilutes the overall average evidence of an option, while shared cues have a context-dependent impact by simultaneously altering the numerator and denominator.

## THEORY 2 — pi_20
Reference-Dependent Quality Inference: Decision-makers maintain a default reference point (aspiration level) for evaluating product cues. Cues with validities above this reference point are perceived as strengths and add to the option's overall value, while cues below the reference point are perceived as defects and subtract from it. An option with zero features remains at the neutral baseline. This naturally explains why an option with zero features can be strictly preferred over an option with multiple weak cues, as the latter accumulates negative value. A loss aversion mechanism further allows negative signals to be weighted more heavily than positive ones.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_19)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the 'Evidence Averaging Heuristic Theory' (Advocated) from the 'Reference-Dependent Quality Inference' (Competing) by exploiting their diametrically opposed treatments of multiple strong cues. The Competing theory evaluates cues additively relative to a reference point; if a cue is above the reference point, it is a strength and strictly adds to the option's value. The Advocated theory averages the active cues with a base prior. Trial 2 establishes whether the second-best cue (0.85) is perceived as a strength (better than zero features). If it is, the Competing theory mathematically guarantees that an option with the top two cues (Trial 1, Option B) will strictly dominate an option with only the top cue (Trial 1, Option A) because the second cue adds positive value. In contrast, the Advocated theory averages the cues: the average of 0.95 and 0.85 is lower than 0.95 alone. Thus, the Advocated theory can paradoxically predict that adding a strong, highly valid cue to an even stronger cue reduces the option's choice probability (a 'less-is-more' effect for strong cues), a reversal that the Competing theory cannot produce.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times subjects choose Option A (the single best cue) over Option B (the top two cues) in Trial 1. The Advocated theory (Evidence Averaging) predicts a high rate of choosing A due to the less-is-more effect (averaging dilutes the strong first cue). The Competing theory predicts subjects will overwhelmingly choose B because the second cue adds positive value. Thus, the choice probability of A on Trial 1 strongly discriminates the two theories.

def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:

    t1_data = data[t1_mask]
    if len(t1_data) == 0:
        return 0.0
    # The Advocated theory predicts a 'less-is-more' effect where A is chosen over B
    # because the average validity of A's single cue is higher than the average of B's two cues.
    # The Competing theory predicts B is chosen over A because the second cue strictly adds value.
    return float((t1_data['response'] == 0).mean())

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_20)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the 'Reference-Dependent Quality Inference' theory (Advocated) from the 'Evidence Averaging Heuristic Theory' (Competing) by exploiting their diametrically opposed treatments of shared cues. Under the Advocated theory, cues are evaluated independently against a reference point and then summed. Because the softmax choice rule depends solely on the difference in total scores between the two options, adding a shared feature to both options perfectly cancels out, leaving the predicted choice probabilities mathematically identical regardless of the shared cue's validity. In contrast, the Competing theory averages the evidence. Adding a shared cue increases the cue count denominator for both options, which strictly dilutes the absolute difference between their averages. Thus, the Competing theory predicts that adding shared cues will systematically compress the difference between the options and drive choice probabilities toward 50% (a regression to chance), whereas the Advocated theory mathematically guarantees strict invariance across these trials.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The Advocated theory (Reference-Dependent Quality Inference) evaluates cues independently and computes the difference in total scores. Adding shared features perfectly cancels out, meaning the probability of choosing B should be mathematically identical in Trial 1 and Trial 3. Any difference is purely due to binomial sampling noise. In contrast, the Competing theory (Evidence Averaging) predicts that adding shared features increases the denominator for both options, diluting the difference in their average validities and driving the choice probability closer to 50%. Thus, the absolute difference in choice probabilities between Trial 1 and Trial 3 will be significantly larger under the Competing theory.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the experimental suite, Theory 1 (Evidence Averaging, pi_19) is overwhelmingly superior at predicting choice behavior, particularly the robust 'less-is-more' effects observed when adding weaker cues to strong ones (Experiment 1) or preferring zero features over multiple weak features (Experiment 37). However, Theory 1 fails to capture the exact invariance observed in Experiment 2, where adding shared features to both options leaves choice probabilities completely unchanged. Theory 1 predicts a regression to 50% because shared features inflate the denominator. Theory 2 (Reference-Dependent Quality Inference, pi_20) perfectly captures this invariance because it evaluates cues additively (where shared features mathematically cancel out), but it fails to capture the less-is-more effect for strong cues and generally underperforms across the broader suite of experiments. We need a theory that reconciles the less-is-more effect with the exact cancellation of shared features.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Shared-Feature Cancellation and Evidence Averaging' theory. Decision-makers first simplify the choice by identifying and canceling out any features that are shared (active) in both options. After this cancellation step, they evaluate each option by averaging the validities of its remaining unique active cues (incorporating a base prior to prevent zero-division). This hybrid approach will perfectly preserve the less-is-more effect for unique features (capturing Exp 1, 15, 22, 37) while guaranteeing mathematical invariance when shared features are added, perfectly capturing the null effect in Exp 2."
