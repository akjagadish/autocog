# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_8`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_11`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_11`).

Propose a 'Threshold-Gated Dilution' or 'Attention-Weighted Averaging' theory. The core idea should be that dilution is not a global, uniform penalty applied to all cues. Instead, weak cues might only be integrated (and thus cause a denominator penalty) if they cross a certain threshold of attention or if enough of them accumulate to force a shift from a non-compensatory (TTB) evaluation to a compensatory, averaging one. If only one or two weak cues are present, they are ignored (acting like TTB, explaining Exps 1, 16, 17). But if a coalition of weak cues is present, they trigger a weighted average calculation, bringing down the option's overall subjective value (explaining Exps 2, 11, 15).

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.553)

**Description**
Dual-Process Strategy Selection Theory: Decision-makers probabilistically select between a non-compensatory heuristic (Take-The-Best) and a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive, WADD) on a trial-by-trial basis. The probability of employing the non-compensatory heuristic is a logistic function of the absolute validity of the highest-ranking discriminating cue. When the top discriminating cue is highly valid, subjects are highly likely to rely solely on it (TTB). However, when the top discriminating cue is weak, confidence in the heuristic drops, and subjects fall back to integrating all available information (WADD).

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.485)

**Description**
Evidence Dilution and Non-linear Weighting Theory (Validity-based Dilution with Amplified Penalty): Decision-makers evaluate options by integrating the validities of present features. However, instead of purely adding evidence, they partially average it. The presence of many low-validity features can paradoxically dilute the overall subjective value of an option (Evidence Dilution). This dilution is proportional to the sum of the validities of the present cues, and subjects apply a non-linear scaling to feature validities, amplifying the impact of the most valid cues. A potentially strong dilution penalty allows for severe subjective devaluation of options burdened with numerous weak features.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.475)

**Description**
Strategy Mixture Theory: Decision-makers do not uniformly rely on a single decision strategy. Instead, they exhibit variability in strategy selection, probabilistically mixing between a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive, WADD). The mixture parameter 'alpha' dictates the probability of using TTB on any given trial, while '1 - alpha' is the probability of using WADD. This allows the model to capture intermediate choice proportions that neither pure strategy can explain on its own, with a bias toward the empirically dominant non-compensatory strategy.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.2520 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2520 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Threshold-Gated Dilution Theory: Decision-makers integrate cues differently depending on the number of active cues. When an option has only a few active cues (below a threshold), they are integrated additively (acting like a non-compensatory strategy if weights are steep). However, when a coalition of many cues is present, it triggers a shift to an averaging process, where the total evidence is diluted by the number of active cues. This explains why adding many weak cues to an option can paradoxically reduce its subjective value.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    lambda_val = float(parameters["lambda_val"])
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    tau = int(parameters["tau"])
    
    w = val ** lambda_val
    
    n_a = np.sum(a)
    n_b = np.sum(b)
    
    if n_a <= tau:
        v_a = np.sum(w * a)
    else:
        v_a = np.sum(w * a) / (n_a ** gamma)
        
    if n_b <= tau:
        v_b = np.sum(w * b)
    else:
        v_b = np.sum(w * b) / (n_b ** gamma)
        
    scores = np.array([v_a, v_b])
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- lambda_val: [1.0, 20.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- tau: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory implements a Threshold-Gated Dilution mechanism. Instead of applying a global dilution penalty to all options, the penalty is gated by a threshold parameter ('tau'). If an option has only a few active cues (e.g., 1 or 2), the decision-maker merely sums their non-linearly scaled validities, mimicking a Take-The-Best heuristic without dilution. But if an option is supported by a coalition of many cues, the evaluation shifts to a compensatory, averaging mode, dividing the accumulated evidence by the number of active cues raised to a power ('gamma'). This captures the empirical finding that options with numerous weak cues are heavily penalized (explaining the dramatic effects in Experiments 9, 13, and 20), while isolated weak cues are ignored.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Threshold-Gated Dilution theory successfully improves on the base by capturing the non-compensatory behavior in some experiments while penalizing large coalitions of weak cues in others (e.g., Exp 20). However, the hard threshold logic (`n <= tau`) creates severe discontinuities that lead to major mispredictions in Exps 9, 13, 14, 15, and 19. For instance, in Exp 9, the observed metric is -0.7263, but the candidate predicts 0.0074. In Exps 14, 15, and 19, the observed values are close to 0, but the candidate predicts massive shifts (-0.2867, 0.3975, -0.3617) because adding a cue suddenly triggers the dilution penalty for the entire sum, abruptly tanking the option's value.
Rationale: While the threshold-gated dilution family is correct and yielded an accepted candidate, the strict binary threshold creates value cliffs. Refine the mechanism within this family to be smoother. Instead of a hard split where `v = sum` vs `v = sum / (n**gamma)`, consider a continuous dilution factor or applying the dilution penalty only to the cues beyond the threshold (e.g., dividing by `max(1, n - tau)**gamma` or similar smooth transition). Also, ensure `tau` can take continuous values or use a softer gating function (like a sigmoid based on `n`) to blend the additive and averaging regimes, preventing the abrupt preference reversals seen in Exps 14, 15, and 19.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2520 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
