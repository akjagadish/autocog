# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_3") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Sequential Evidence Accumulation Theory: Decision-makers sample cues sequentially in order of their validity, accumulating evidence for each option. The accumulation process stops as soon as the absolute difference in evidence between the two options reaches a subject-specific threshold. A low threshold mimics non-compensatory heuristics like Take-The-Best by stopping at the first discriminating cue, while a high threshold mimics compensatory strategies like Weighted Additive (WADD) by integrating all available cues. This natural stopping rule generates variable choice probabilities across different conflict geometries, naturally capturing moderate variance across stimuli without requiring non-linear scaling of validities.

## THEORY 2 — pi_3
People make decisions by integrating all available information rather than stopping at the first discriminating cue or simply counting features. According to the Weighted Additive (WADD) theory, decision-makers evaluate each option by computing a sum of its features, weighted by the subjective validity of each feature. However, people may non-linearly amplify the importance of highly valid cues. To capture this, validities are exponentiated by a scaling parameter and then normalized, allowing the model to smoothly interpolate between highly compensatory (Tallying-like) and non-compensatory (TTB-like) decision strategies without shrinking the overall scale of the evidence. Choice probabilities are generated via a softmax function over the weighted sums, with an independent lapse rate for random guessing.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates Sequential Evidence Accumulation (SEA) from the Weighted Additive (WADD) theory by exploiting their fundamentally different mechanisms for scaling evidence. WADD scales validities via exponentiation (gamma), which relies on the ratio between validities. Because the ratio between adjacent validities increases as validities get smaller (e.g., 0.75/0.65 > 0.85/0.75), WADD naturally becomes *more* non-compensatory (TTB-like) at lower levels of the cue hierarchy. In contrast, SEA uses an absolute difference threshold (theta) on unscaled validities. Because the absolute values of the validities decrease down the hierarchy, SEA naturally becomes *less* non-compensatory at lower levels, as single cues are no longer large enough to cross the fixed threshold. By pitting a single discriminating cue against the remaining lower cues at different levels of the hierarchy (e.g., Cue 2 vs Cues 3-5, and Cue 3 vs Cues 4-5), SEA predicts non-compensatory choices at the top of the hierarchy and compensatory choices at the bottom. WADD predicts the exact opposite pattern, making them highly distinguishable.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Measures the difference in the non-compensatory choice rate between the top of the cue hierarchy (Trial 1) and the bottom of the hierarchy (Trial 4). SEA predicts a higher non-compensatory choice rate in Trial 1 than Trial 4 because the absolute difference in evidence easily crosses the threshold at the top but not at the bottom. WADD predicts the opposite pattern, as the ratio of adjacent validities increases down the hierarchy, making it more non-compensatory at the bottom.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.85, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65, 0.6]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates Sequential Evidence Accumulation (SEA) from the Weighted Additive (WADD) theory by exploiting the bounded nature of SEA's stopping threshold (theta max = 1.25). In Trials 1 and 2, one option is favored by the top two most valid cues, while the other is favored by the remaining four. Because SEA accumulates evidence sequentially, the first two cues generate a running difference (0.85 + 0.80 = 1.65) that strictly exceeds the maximum possible threshold. Consequently, SEA is forced to stop and choose the option with the top two cues across 100% of valid parameter combinations, completely ignoring the remaining four cues. In contrast, WADD integrates all available information. Because the linear sum of the bottom four cues (2.70) is vastly greater than the top two (1.65), WADD strongly favors the option with the bottom four cues when its non-linear scaling parameter (gamma) is low, and smoothly shifts to favoring the top two cues as gamma increases. Trials 3 and 4 serve as controls where the running difference fluctuates, allowing SEA to also predict a shift in choices across its parameter range.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the difference in preference for the option favored by the most valid cue between Trials 1/2 and Trials 3/4. In Trials 1/2, the top two cues favor the same option, generating a cumulative evidence difference of 1.65. Because SEA's maximum threshold is 1.25, it is strictly forced to stop by the second cue and strongly favor this option across all parameter values. In Trials 3/4, the second cue favors the opposing option, causing the running difference to plummet to 0.05. For subjects with a threshold > 0.85 (approx. 32% of the range), SEA will continue sampling until the final cue, ultimately favoring the opposing option. This creates a large positive difference in choice probabilities between the two trial types for SEA. In contrast, WADD integrates all cues simultaneously. The linear sum of validities in Trials 1/2 vs 3/4 is almost identical (a negligible difference of 0.05 out of ~4.35), so WADD predicts roughly equal choice probabilities across both trial types, yielding a difference near zero.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the experiments, THEORY 2 (pi_3, WADD with non-linear scaling) generally outperforms THEORY 1 (pi_5, Sequential Evidence Accumulation). In Experiment 2, pi_3 correctly predicts the near-zero difference (0.0346 vs observed 0.0475), whereas pi_5 erroneously predicts a large positive difference. However, both theories struggle with Experiment 1, where the observed data shows a massive 0.6875 difference in non-compensatory choice rates between the top and bottom of the cue hierarchy. pi_3 correctly predicts a positive difference but underestimates its magnitude, while pi_5 incorrectly predicts a negative difference. The observed data suggests a strategy shift: people are highly non-compensatory when the most valid cues are involved, but switch to compensatory integration when relying on less valid cues. A rigid sequential accumulator fails to capture this, and a single non-linear WADD model struggles to produce the extreme shift observed in Experiment 1 without disrupting its fit on other experiments.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a Dual-Process / Strategy Selection theory. Instead of a single mechanism (like sequential accumulation or WADD), decision-makers probabilistically select between a fast, non-compensatory heuristic (Take-The-Best) and a compensatory strategy (WADD or Tallying). The probability of employing the non-compensatory heuristic is a function of the absolute validity or salience of the highest-ranking discriminating cue. When the top cue is highly valid (top of the hierarchy), subjects overwhelmingly use TTB; when the top discriminating cue is weak (bottom of the hierarchy), they fall back to compensatory integration. This dual-process approach can naturally explain the extreme difference in Experiment 1 while maintaining the balanced compensatory behavior seen in Experiment 2 and others."
