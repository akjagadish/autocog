# generation_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Replace Strategy Mixture Theory with a Sequential Evidence Accumulation theory. In this theory, decision-makers sample cues sequentially (perhaps ordered by validity or randomly) and accumulate evidence for each option until a threshold is reached. If the threshold is reached early, it mimics Take-The-Best; if evidence accumulates slowly due to conflicting cues, it mimics WADD or Tallying. This natural stopping rule generates variable choice probabilities across different conflict geometries without requiring non-linear scaling of validities, naturally capturing the moderate variance seen in Exp 1 and the muted differences seen in Exp 2.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.600)

**Description**
Strategy Mixture Theory: Decision-makers do not uniformly rely on a single decision strategy. Instead, they exhibit variability in strategy selection, probabilistically mixing between a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive, WADD). The mixture parameter 'alpha' dictates the probability of using TTB on any given trial, while '1 - alpha' is the probability of using WADD. This allows the model to capture intermediate choice proportions that neither pure strategy can explain on its own, with a bias toward the empirically dominant non-compensatory strategy.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.546)

**Description**
People make decisions by integrating all available information rather than stopping at the first discriminating cue or simply counting features. According to the Weighted Additive (WADD) theory, decision-makers evaluate each option by computing a sum of its features, weighted by the subjective validity of each feature. However, people may non-linearly amplify the importance of highly valid cues. To capture this, validities are exponentiated by a scaling parameter and then normalized, allowing the model to smoothly interpolate between highly compensatory (Tallying-like) and non-compensatory (TTB-like) decision strategies without shrinking the overall scale of the evidence. Choice probabilities are generated via a softmax function over the weighted sums, with an independent lapse rate for random guessing.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.499)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.5399 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2051 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.3005 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.2610 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.2051 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Sequential Evidence Accumulation Theory: Decision-makers sample cues sequentially in order of their validity, accumulating evidence for each option. The accumulation process stops as soon as the absolute difference in evidence between the two options reaches a subject-specific threshold. A low threshold mimics non-compensatory heuristics like Take-The-Best by stopping at the first discriminating cue, while a high threshold mimics compensatory strategies like Weighted Additive (WADD) by integrating all available cues. This natural stopping rule generates variable choice probabilities across different conflict geometries, naturally capturing moderate variance across stimuli without requiring non-linear scaling of validities.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    theta = float(parameters["theta"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Sort cues by validity descending
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
    
    score_a = 0.0
    score_b = 0.0
    
    for j in cue_order:
        score_a += val[j] * a[j]
        score_b += val[j] * b[j]
        
        diff = abs(score_a - score_b)
        # Stop if threshold is reached AND there is a strict difference (to avoid stopping on ties if theta is 0)
        if diff >= theta and diff > 1e-9:
            break
            
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- theta: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the critic's feedback, the parameter range for the evidence accumulation threshold `theta` is tightened from [0.0, 3.0] to [0.0, 1.0]. This ensures the model halts cue evaluation earlier on average, better matching the strong non-compensatory (Take-The-Best) behavior seen in human data for Experiments 1 and 2. Additionally, the `epsilon` range is reduced to [0.0, 0.2] to prevent excessive random noise from washing out the strategic predictions. The core Sequential Evidence Accumulation mechanism remains exactly as before.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model implements the prescribed Sequential Evidence Accumulation theory but fails to capture the empirical choice patterns. In Experiment 1, the observed TTB match is 0.758, whereas the candidate predicts 0.378. In Experiment 2, the observed Tally preference is 0.250 (indicating a strong preference for the TTB option), but the candidate predicts 0.691 (indicating it integrates too much and chooses the Tally/WADD option). This suggests the evidence accumulation threshold `theta` is too high on average, causing the model to integrate all cues (acting like WADD/Tally) rather than stopping early (acting like TTB).
Rationale: The current parameter range for `theta` [0.0, 3.0] is too broad and heavily biases the model toward full integration (compensatory behavior), missing the strong non-compensatory (early stopping) behavior seen in human data. Regenerate the model keeping the Sequential Evidence Accumulation mechanism exactly as is, but tighten the `theta` range to something lower (e.g., [0.0, 1.5] or [0.0, 1.0]) to encourage more frequent early stopping. Additionally, reduce the `epsilon` range to [0.0, 0.2] to prevent excessive random noise from washing out the strategic predictions.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5399 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2051 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model implements Sequential Evidence Accumulation with a tightened threshold parameter, which successfully corrected the over-integration seen in iteration 1. As a result, the model now accurately captures the strong non-compensatory (Take-The-Best) tendencies in Exps 1, 2, and 3, and perfectly matches the small variance metrics in Exps 5 and 6. However, in Experiment 4, the candidate predicts a choice rate for option B of ~9%, whereas the human data shows ~40%. This indicates that by restricting theta to [0.0, 1.0], the model stops *too* early on average, becoming slightly too deterministic in its TTB-like choices and missing the subset of subjects who integrate more cues in this specific conflict geometry.
Rationale: The previous suggestion to lower theta was highly successful (improving aggregate loss from 0.53 to 0.20), but [0.0, 1.0] overcorrected slightly, leading to overly extreme TTB behavior in Experiment 4. Keep the exact same Sequential Evidence Accumulation mechanism, but slightly widen the upper bound of the `theta` range to [0.0, 1.25] or [0.0, 1.5]. This will allow a slightly higher proportion of simulated subjects to integrate multiple cues, softening the extreme choice probabilities in Exp 4 while preserving the excellent fits on the other experiments.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2051 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.3005 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model widened the threshold parameter `theta` to [0.0, 1.5] based on previous advice. While this successfully pulled the Experiment 4 prediction closer to the observed 0.39, it drastically degraded the fits for Experiments 1, 2, and 3, causing the aggregate loss to increase (0.3005) and the candidate to be REJECTED. The running best (Iter 2) had `theta` at [0.0, 1.0] and produced predictions that were highly accurate in direction but systematically too extreme (e.g., predicting 0.82 vs observed 0.75 for Exp 1; 0.16 vs 0.25 for Exp 2; 0.09 vs 0.39 for Exp 4). This suggests the core mechanism and threshold range of Iter 2 were correct, but the choice rule was too deterministic.
Rationale: The previous suggestion to widen `theta` was REJECTED because it shifted the strategy distribution too far toward compensatory integration, breaking the good fits on Exps 1-3. Instead of changing the stopping threshold, we should make the softmax choice rule less deterministic. Revert the `theta` range to [0.0, 1.0] (the successful Iter 2 range), but reduce the upper bound of the inverse temperature `beta` from 20.0 to something much lower, such as [0.1, 5.0] or [0.1, 3.0]. Lowering `beta` will soften the choice probabilities, naturally pulling the overly extreme predictions of the accepted base model towards the more moderate observed human choice rates across all experiments.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.3005 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.2610 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model (Iter 4) attempted to soften the extreme predictions of the Iter 2 base by lowering the softmax inverse temperature `beta`. While this successfully pulled the predictions for Exps 1, 2, 3, and 4 closer to the human data, it drastically inflated the difference metric in Exp 6 (0.1338 vs observed 0.0175). When choices are highly deterministic (high beta), both trial types in Exp 6 are chosen near 100% or 0%, yielding a small difference. Lowering beta pushed these probabilities away from the boundaries at different rates, artificially inflating the difference. Consequently, the candidate was REJECTED by the gate.
Rationale: Lowering `beta` to soften choices was REJECTED because it inadvertently inflated the Exp 6 difference metric. To soften the extreme choice probabilities (e.g., pulling Exp 4 from 0.09 up to 0.39, and Exp 1 from 0.82 down to 0.75) without inflating differences between similar trial types, we should use the lapse rate (`epsilon`) instead of the softmax temperature. Revert `beta` to its original wide range [0.1, 20.0] so that the core evidence accumulation remains sharp, keep `theta` at the successful [0.0, 1.0] range, and increase the upper bound of `epsilon` to [0.0, 0.5]. This will uniformly compress all choice probabilities towards 0.5, naturally correcting the extreme deterministic predictions of the Iter 2 base while keeping the Exp 6 difference small.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.2610 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
