# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Propose a fundamentally new theory based on Sequential Evidence Accumulation with Attention Shifts (e.g., a variant of Decision Field Theory or Leaky Competing Accumulator). In this theory, decision-makers sample features sequentially over time. The probability of attending to a feature is proportional to its validity, but the evidence accumulation process includes a stopping rule or lateral inhibition. This allows the model to act like TTB when a highly valid cue quickly drives the accumulator to a threshold, but act like WADD or Tallying when early cues provide conflicting evidence, extending the decision time and allowing lower-validity cues to influence the choice. This dynamic approach naturally explains both the compensatory and non-compensatory patterns observed across the experiments.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Sequential Evidence Accumulation with Lateral Inhibition and Leak (LCA): Decision-makers sequentially sample features over time. The probability of attending to a feature is proportional to a power of its validity. As evidence accumulates, the options laterally inhibit each other, and accumulated evidence decays over time (leak). To capture massive non-linear thresholding behaviors (like single-cue dominance vs. coalitions), the lateral inhibition can be very strong and the decision threshold can be very low, allowing highly valid early cues to immediately trigger a decision. A small amount of noise in accumulation prevents stalling when evidence is tied.

- leak: [0.0, 1.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- sigma: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, we significantly widen the parameter range for `inhibition` (up to 5.0) to allow for much stronger lateral suppression between options, and lower the lower bound of the decision threshold `theta` down to 0.1. This permits highly valid early cues to immediately trigger a decision (winner-take-all) before leak and inhibition drag out the process, which is necessary to capture the massive effect sizes observed in Experiments 7 and 9. Additionally, we introduce a small Gaussian noise term (`sigma`) to the evidence accumulation step to prevent complete stalling when evidence is tied.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2997 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2989 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3326 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.2989.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model successfully implements the arbiter's prescribed Sequential Evidence Accumulation with lateral inhibition (LCA variant) and achieved a new running-best loss, successfully passing the accept gate. It elegantly unifies compensatory and non-compensatory dynamics through a single mechanism. However, the model still struggles significantly with Experiments 7 and 9. In Experiment 7, it fails to capture the large difference between trials with opposing coalitions versus trials with tied early cues. In Experiment 9, it completely misses the directional shift in preference.
Rationale: The candidate is on the right track and was accepted by the gate, but fit quality can be further improved within the prescribed mechanism family. To better capture the nuances in Experiments 7 and 9, upgrade the model to a true Leaky Competing Accumulator by introducing a 'leak' (decay) parameter to the accumulators. This will allow older accumulated evidence to decay over time, which dynamically alters the balance between early conflicting cues and later sampled cues. Additionally, expand the `gamma` parameter range down to 0.1 (i.e., [0.1, 20.0]) to allow the model to explore more uniform feature sampling distributions, which may be necessary to fit the compensatory behavior in the dataset.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2997 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2989 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model successfully implemented the Leaky Competing Accumulator (LCA) with leak and was ACCEPTED by the gate, achieving a new running-best loss. The leak parameter clearly helped marginally improve the overall fit. However, the model still catastrophically misses the massive effect sizes in Experiments 7 and 9. In Experiment 7, the empirical difference is +0.6875, while the model produces +0.0587. In Experiment 9, the empirical difference is -0.7263, while the model produces +0.2200. The model is currently unable to generate the strong non-linear thresholding behavior required to capture these coalition vs. single-cue dynamics.
Rationale: The current LCA structure is on the right track and was accepted, so we must retain it. To address the massive gaps in Experiments 7 and 9, the accumulator dynamics need to allow for much stronger winner-take-all behavior and faster early decisions. I recommend widening the parameter range for `inhibition` significantly (e.g., [0.0, 5.0]) to allow for much stronger lateral suppression between options. Additionally, lower the lower bound of the decision threshold `theta` to 0.1 (i.e., [0.1, 10.0]) so that highly valid early cues can immediately trigger a decision before leak and inhibition drag out the process. Finally, ensure that the sampling probabilities can become extremely peaked by keeping the gamma upper bound high, and consider adding a small constant noise term to the evidence accumulation to prevent complete stalling when evidence is tied.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2989 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3326 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current candidate was REJECTED by the gate, as the aggregate loss increased to 0.3326. The previous advice to drastically widen lateral inhibition, lower the threshold bound to 0.1, and add Gaussian noise disrupted the model's core performance, severely degrading fits on Experiments 1, 3, and 10 without solving the massive gaps in Experiments 7 and 9. The noise and extreme inhibition likely caused the accumulators to become too chaotic, losing the stable compensatory vs. non-compensatory balance achieved in Iteration 2.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since the candidate was rejected, the loop will automatically revert to the Iteration 2 base. To improve upon that base without introducing the instability of Iteration 3, we should avoid adding noise and instead implement a 'collapsing decision threshold' (or urgency signal). Introduce a new parameter `collapse_rate` (e.g., range [0.0, 0.1]) such that the threshold at each step is `max(0.01, theta - step * collapse_rate)`. This is a well-established mechanism in Sequential Evidence Accumulation that forces a decision when evidence is mixed or tied (acting like Tallying/WADD for longer deliberations) while still allowing highly valid early cues to immediately cross the initial high threshold (acting like TTB). Retain the leak and standard LCA mechanisms from Iteration 2, but remove the `sigma` noise term."
