# feedback_iter_04

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_8`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_9`).

Propose a new theory that replaces the rigid attention gate of pi_9. Instead of an absolute threshold that completely zeroes out weak cues, consider a 'Relative Contrast Integration' or 'Competitive Weighting' theory. In this theory, the weight of a cue depends on its relative validity compared to the *competing* cue on the same dimension, rather than a global attention gate based on the maximum cue within the same option. Alternatively, propose a model where dilution only occurs for conflicting cues (cues that point in opposite directions) rather than all present cues, allowing options to accumulate evidence without being artificially penalized by their own weak supporting features.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Relative Contrast Integration with Own-Cue Dilution: Decision-makers evaluate options by comparing only the features where the options differ (relative evidence). The relative evidence of an option is non-linearly weighted, but critically, it is diluted by its own count of unique/discriminating cues. This ensures that when an option attempts to win using a sheer quantity of weak, opposing cues, its integrated value is heavily penalized, capturing the 'less is more' effect.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    lambda_val = float(parameters["lambda_val"])
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    w = val ** lambda_val
    
    # Focus only on discriminating features
    a_only = a * (1 - b)
    b_only = b * (1 - a)
    
    # Compute relative evidence
    ev_a = np.sum(w * a_only)
    ev_b = np.sum(w * b_only)
    
    # Dilute relative evidence by an option's OWN count of unique cues
    v_a = ev_a / ((1.0 + np.sum(a_only)) ** gamma)
    v_b = ev_b / ((1.0 + np.sum(b_only)) ** gamma)
    
    scores = np.array([v_a, v_b])
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- lambda_val: [0.1, 10.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Follows the critic's advice to build on the accepted Iteration 2 base by introducing Relative Contrast Integration. We compute evidence based only on discriminating cues (`a_only` and `b_only`). Crucially, to fix the backward dilution bug from the rejected Iteration 4, we dilute each option's relative evidence by its OWN count of unique cues (`np.sum(a_only)` and `np.sum(b_only)`). This ensures that an option burdened by many weak, opposing features penalizes itself, properly capturing the deep negative shifts in Experiments 9 and 13.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3397 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2968 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.3053 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.3423 -> REJECTED
- iter 5 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3092 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.2968.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model was ACCEPTED and improves the overall aggregate loss, but it completely reverses the direction of the effect in Experiments 7, 9, and 13. For instance, in Experiment 9, the real data shows a strong negative value (-0.7263), indicating that an option with many weak cues (Option B in Trial 4) is heavily penalized (the 'dilution effect'), making Option A much more preferred. The candidate yields a positive value (0.2284). By restricting dilution ONLY to conflicting opponent cues, the model lost the ability to penalize an option for its own weak cues.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED, but the specific choice to only dilute based on the opponent's cues destroys the model's ability to capture the dilution effect (Experiments 7, 9, 13). To fix this while staying within the prescribed 'Competitive Weighting / Contrast Integration' family, you must reintroduce a dilution penalty for an option's OWN cues. Adjust the denominator so that an option's accumulated evidence is diluted by its own feature count or sum of own cue weights (e.g., dividing by `(1.0 + np.sum(a))**gamma`), possibly in addition to the opponent's conflicting cues. This will restore the 'less is more' penalty for options burdened by many weak supporting features.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3397 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2968 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was ACCEPTED and improved the aggregate loss (from 0.3397 to 0.2968). Reintroducing own-cue dilution helped, but the model still fails to capture the deep negative values in Experiments 9 (-0.7263) and 13 (-0.6683). In Experiment 9, Option B has many weak cues in Trial 4, which should make Option A much more preferred than in Trial 1 (yielding a negative difference). However, the candidate yields a near-zero positive value (0.0253). This happens because the denominator for Option A includes `conflict_against_a` (the opponent's cues). When Option B has many weak cues, they not only penalize Option B (via `own_cues_b`) but also penalize Option A (via `conflict_against_a`). As a result, both options' values are dragged down, neutralizing the intended 'less is more' advantage for Option A.
Rationale: To properly capture the dilution effect in Experiments 9 and 13, an option's weak cues must penalize itself much more than they penalize the opponent. Currently, `v_a` is divided by `(1.0 + conflict_against_a + own_cues_a)**gamma`. Because `conflict_against_a` contains the opponent's cues, Option B's numerous weak cues are artificially dragging down Option A's value. Remove `conflict_against_a` (and `conflict_against_b`) from the denominator entirely. The denominator for an option should depend primarily on its OWN cue count or own cue sum (e.g., `v_a = ev_a / ((1.0 + own_cues_a) ** gamma)`). This ensures that an option burdened by many weak features penalizes itself without dragging down a focused, high-validity opponent.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2968 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.3053 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the aggregate loss worsened compared to Iteration 2. While removing the opponent's cues from the dilution denominator (relying solely on 'own cues') moved Experiments 9 and 13 slightly in the right direction, it failed to produce the massive negative shift required, and the overall fit degraded. We need to abandon the purely 'own-cue dilution' approach and return to the arbiter's primary recommendation: Relative Contrast Integration.
Rationale: Since the previous advice to use only 'own cues' for dilution was REJECTED, build on the accepted Iteration 2 base by shifting to the arbiter's 'Relative Contrast Integration' approach. Instead of calculating absolute evidence for A and B independently, compute RELATIVE evidence. Specifically, only integrate cues where the options differ. Evidence for A should be the sum of `val**lambda_val` for dimensions where A=1 and B=0. Evidence for B is the sum for dimensions where B=1 and A=0. Then, dilute A's relative evidence by the number of conflicting cues (i.e., the count of dimensions where B=1 and A=0), and vice versa for B. This directly implements the arbiter's suggestion to focus on competing/conflicting cues and should create a much sharper contrast in trials where one option is burdened by many weak, opposing features.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.3053 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.3423 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate (Iteration 4) was REJECTED by the gate because it severely worsened the aggregate loss and failed to capture the dilution effects in Experiments 9 and 13. The structural issue lies in a logical inversion in the dilution mechanism: the candidate dilutes Option A's evidence by the count of Option B's unique cues (`conflicting_cues_against_a = np.sum(b_only)`). Consequently, in Experiment 9, Trial 4, when Option B has a coalition of 4 weak opposing cues, Option A's evidence is heavily penalized (divided by 5^gamma), while Option B is barely penalized (divided by 2^gamma). This backwards penalty completely destroys the 'less is more' effect, causing the model to strongly prefer Option B instead of Option A.
Rationale: The candidate was REJECTED due to a backwards dilution mechanism. To stay within the arbiter's prescribed 'Relative Contrast Integration' family while fixing this bug, build on the accepted Iteration 2 base but retain the relative evidence computation (`a_only` and `b_only`) from Iteration 4. However, you must fix the denominator: an option's relative evidence should be diluted by its OWN count of unique/discriminating cues, not the opponent's. Set `v_a = ev_a / ((1.0 + np.sum(a_only)) ** gamma)` and `v_b = ev_b / ((1.0 + np.sum(b_only)) ** gamma)`. This ensures that when an option attempts to win using a sheer quantity of weak cues, its integrated value is heavily penalized by its own cue count, properly capturing the deep negative shifts in Experiments 9 and 13.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.3423 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3092 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the aggregate loss worsened. The attempt to compute evidence and dilution using ONLY discriminating cues (`a_only` and `b_only`) failed to improve the fit and still did not capture the massive negative shift in Experiment 9 (-0.7263). In Experiment 9 Trial 4, Option B has a coalition of 4 weak cues, which should make it much worse than Trial 1 where it has 1 cue. If we only use discriminating cues, we lose the baseline context of the options' overall quality. The recent iterations have shown that restricting the computation to relative/discriminating cues before applying dilution distorts the choice probabilities.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since the attempts to use relative/discriminating cues (`a_only`) for evidence and dilution have been repeatedly REJECTED, build on the accepted Iteration 2 base but simplify the 'own-cue dilution' mechanism. Return to computing ABSOLUTE evidence using ALL present cues (i.e., `ev_a = np.sum(w * a)`). Then, dilute each option's evidence by its OWN total count of present cues (e.g., `v_a = ev_a / (np.maximum(1.0, np.sum(a))) ** gamma`). By applying the dilution parameter `gamma` to the total absolute cue count rather than just conflicting or discriminating cues, the model naturally computes a weighted average of an option's features. This will heavily penalize Option B in Experiment 9 when it adds many weak cues (lowering its average validity), properly capturing the 'less is more' effect without the edge-case distortions introduced by filtering out shared cues."
