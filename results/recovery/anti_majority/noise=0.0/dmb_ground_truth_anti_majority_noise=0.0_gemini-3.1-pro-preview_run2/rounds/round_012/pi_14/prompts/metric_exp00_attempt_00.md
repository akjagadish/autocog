# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.8, 0.75, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates 'Rank-Weighted Capacity-Bounded Integration' (Advocated) from 'Evidence Dilution and Non-linear Weighting Theory' (Competing) by exploiting how each theory calculates its penalty for having multiple features. The Advocated theory penalizes options based solely on the raw COUNT of excess active cues beyond its capacity bound (K). The Competing theory dilutes options based on the SUM of the validities of all active cues. By pairing options that share the identical top cue and the identical total number of active cues, but differ in the validities of their remaining 'weak' cues, we perfectly isolate this difference. Under the Advocated theory, because the cue counts are identical, the excess penalty is identical; meanwhile, Option A's higher-validity weak cues give it a higher or equal base value, leading to a strict prediction that Option A is preferred or tied. Under the Competing theory, Option A's higher-validity weak cues significantly inflate its dilution denominator (sum of validities) while adding little to its non-linearly scaled numerator, leading to a strong prediction that Option B is preferred. This produces diametrically opposed predictions.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Rank-Weighted Capacity-Bounded Integration with Bounded Non-linear Penalty: Decision-makers integrate cues based on their validity, but cognitive capacity limits the number of features that can be positively evaluated. The top K valid active features for an option are summed to form its base value. Any additional active features beyond this capacity limit act as a cognitive complexity penalty. This penalty scales non-linearly with the number of excess features and subtracts from the base value, but the overall subjective value is bounded at zero to prevent extreme negative evaluations. This explains why adding many weak features penalizes an option heavily without causing unrealistic certainty in choice probabilities.

**Parameters:**
- lambda_val: [0.1, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- penalty: [0.0, 5.0]
- K: {1, 2, 3}

- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Evidence Dilution and Non-linear Weighting Theory (Validity-based Dilution with Amplified Penalty): Decision-makers evaluate options by integrating the validities of present features. However, instead of purely adding evidence, they partially average it. The presence of many low-validity features can paradoxically dilute the overall subjective value of an option (Evidence Dilution). This dilution is proportional to the sum of the validities of the present cues, and subjects apply a non-linear scaling to feature validities, amplifying the impact of the most valid cues. A potentially strong dilution penalty allows for severe subjective devaluation of options burdened with numerous weak features.

**Parameters:**
- lambda_val: [1.0, 20.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**

def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]

    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Non-linear weighting to capture TTB-like reliance on top cues
    w = val ** lambda_val
    
    # Dilute by the sum of validities of the present cues
    sum_val_a = np.sum(val * a)
    sum_val_b = np.sum(val * b)
    
    # Calculate subjective values with a dilution factor (gamma)
    v_a = np.sum(w * a) / (sum_val_a ** gamma) if sum_val_a > 0 else 0.0
    v_b = np.sum(w * b) / (sum_val_b ** gamma) if sum_val_b > 0 else 0.0
    
    scores = np.array([v_a, v_b])

    p = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- metric: Python source defining def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this metric; used when interpreting results.


## Response

```json
{
  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    return float(data['response'].mean())",
  "rationale": "In all trials of the design, Option A and Option B have the exact same number of active features, but Option A's features have strictly higher validities. Under the Advocated theory (Capacity-Bounded Integration), the penalty depends only on the raw count of excess features, which is identical for both options. Since Option A has higher-validity features, its base value is higher, strongly predicting a preference for Option A (response = 0). Conversely, under the Competing theory (Evidence Dilution), the penalty is proportional to the sum of the validities of active features. Because Option A's features are more valid, it suffers a significantly larger dilution penalty, which can invert the preference and lead to choosing Option B (response = 1). Therefore, the overall proportion of choosing Option B (mean of 'response') will be distinctly lower under the Advocated theory than under the Competing theory."
