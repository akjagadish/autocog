# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_8" and "pi_14") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_8" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_14" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_8
Evidence Dilution and Non-linear Weighting Theory (Validity-based Dilution with Amplified Penalty): Decision-makers evaluate options by integrating the validities of present features. However, instead of purely adding evidence, they partially average it. The presence of many low-validity features can paradoxically dilute the overall subjective value of an option (Evidence Dilution). This dilution is proportional to the sum of the validities of the present cues, and subjects apply a non-linear scaling to feature validities, amplifying the impact of the most valid cues. A potentially strong dilution penalty allows for severe subjective devaluation of options burdened with numerous weak features.

## THEORY 2 — pi_14
Rank-Weighted Capacity-Bounded Integration with Bounded Non-linear Penalty: Decision-makers integrate cues based on their validity, but cognitive capacity limits the number of features that can be positively evaluated. The top K valid active features for an option are summed to form its base value. Any additional active features beyond this capacity limit act as a cognitive complexity penalty. This penalty scales non-linearly with the number of excess features and subtracts from the base value, but the overall subjective value is bounded at zero to prevent extreme negative evaluations. This explains why adding many weak features penalizes an option heavily without causing unrealistic certainty in choice probabilities.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_8)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates the 'Evidence Dilution and Non-linear Weighting' theory (Advocated) from the 'Rank-Weighted Capacity-Bounded Integration' theory (Competing) by exploiting the zero-bound in the Competing theory's penalty function. Under the Competing theory, the subjective value of an option is strictly bounded at zero. When multiple weak features are added to both options, the penalty for excess features can abruptly drive the subjective values of BOTH options to exactly zero, resulting in a sudden and complete collapse of choice probability to exactly 50% (chance). In contrast, the Advocated theory dilutes evidence by dividing by the sum of validities. This smoothly reduces the absolute difference between the options' values, predicting a graded, asymptotic regression toward 50% but never a complete collapse to chance, because the ratio of their non-linearly weighted numerators is preserved. By progressively adding shared weak features across trials, we test whether preference degrades smoothly (Advocated) or hits a hard floor at chance (Competing).

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In previous tests, the simple difference between Trial 4 and Trial 1 (r4 - r1) showed a strong mean gap between the theories (Advocated shifting less towards chance than Competing, which frequently hits a hard zero-bound). However, it narrowly failed significance due to binomial noise on individual trial types. This metric improves upon that insight by computing a stabilized 'Difference in Differences' using all available data: it compares the average choice rate of the 'heavy' trials (T3 and T4) against the 'light' trials (T1 and T2). By pooling two trial types for each anchor, we effectively halve the binomial variance per subject while preserving the core theoretical contrast: the Competing theory's abrupt collapse to chance vs. the Advocated theory's smooth, partial dilution.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_14)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=10):** [0.95, 0.95, 0.95, 0.9, 0.5, 0.8, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** This design quantitatively dissociates 'Rank-Weighted Capacity-Bounded Integration' (Advocated) from 'Evidence Dilution and Non-linear Weighting' (Competing) by exploiting the variance of excess cue validities while holding their sum and count constant. Under the Advocated theory, options sharing the exact same top K cues (for K in {1, 2, 3}) have identical base values. Furthermore, because its penalty depends solely on the raw count of excess features, two options with the same number of excess features will incur the exact same penalty, leading to a strict prediction of 50% choice probability (complete indifference). In contrast, the Competing theory calculates evidence using a convex non-linear weighting function (lambda >= 1) and dilutes by the sum of validities. By pairing options that have identical validity sums but different validity variances (e.g., {0.90, 0.50} vs {0.70, 0.70}), the Competing theory's convex numerator strictly prefers the option with higher variance, predicting a strong preference where the Advocated theory predicts a perfect tie.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Under the Advocated theory, options in all trials have identical top K validities and identical counts of excess features, resulting in a strict prediction of 50% choice probability for every trial. Therefore, the expected difference in any weighted feature sum between the chosen and unchosen option is exactly 0, subject only to tight binomial noise. In contrast, the Competing theory evaluates options using a convex non-linear weighting function (lambda >= 1), meaning it systematically prefers the option with more extreme validities (higher variance) when the sum of validities is matched. By raising the validities to the 6th power, we create a 'weight' that perfectly tracks the Competing theory's non-linear numerator. The metric computes the difference in this weighted sum between the chosen and unchosen option. The Advocated theory will yield a tight distribution around 0, while the Competing theory will yield a robust, systematically positive value, powerfully discriminating the two theories.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the 26 experiments, both theories demonstrate significant shortcomings, though pi_8 tends to fit slightly better on some older experiments. In Experiment 1, both theories predicted a positive difference in differences, but the observed value was around zero. In Experiment 2, pi_8 predicted a positive value (indicating preference for higher variance in cue validities) and pi_14 predicted zero, but the observed data showed a strong negative value (-0.1523), meaning subjects systematically preferred the option with more moderate/balanced validities when the sum was matched. This directly contradicts pi_8's convex weighting and pi_14's capacity-bounded indifference. Other experiments (e.g., 17, 21, 24) show both theories drastically missing the observed metrics. The failure of both theories to capture the preference for balanced validities and the true nature of the dilution effect suggests that a fundamentally new mechanism is needed.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Diminishing Returns and Cue Count Dilution' theory. Instead of a convex weighting function (lambda > 1) or a strict top-K capacity bound, this theory should posit that the subjective weight of a cue's validity undergoes a concave transformation (lambda < 1), reflecting diminishing marginal returns for extremely high-validity cues. This directly explains the negative observed metric in Experiment 2, as a sum of moderate concavely-transformed validities will exceed a sum of extreme ones. Furthermore, instead of penalizing excess features or diluting by the sum of validities, the total integrated evidence should be diluted simply by the raw count of active features (or total features presented), capturing the heuristic that 'more arguments' might reduce the perceived strength of the best arguments without a hard zero-bound."
