# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_20`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_14`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_20`).

Propose a new theory based on 'Rank-Weighted Diminishing Returns'. Instead of contiguity or spread penalties, decision-makers might evaluate options by rank-ordering their unique features and applying a steep diminishing marginal utility to additional features. The highest-validity unique feature carries dominant weight, but subsequent features contribute logarithmically or fractionally. This naturally favors options with a single very strong feature over options with multiple moderate features without needing an explicit 'spread' or 'conflict' penalty, while also avoiding the unsupported spatial contiguity assumptions of Theory 1.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Rank-Weighted Diminishing Returns (Hyperbolic Decay): Decision-makers simplify choices by cancelling out shared features, then evaluating the remaining unique features by rank-ordering them according to their validity. A hyperbolic diminishing marginal utility is applied to lower-ranked features. This naturally favors options with a single, highly valid feature, but allows a cluster of secondary features to overcome the anchor if the decay is soft enough, effectively balancing spread and anchor strength without needing an explicit conflict penalty.

- delta: [0.0, 5.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, we reverted to evaluating strictly unique features (cancelling out shared ones) because evaluating full profiles destroyed the model's discriminability on shared-feature trials. To address the inflexibility in Experiments 14 and 16, we changed the rank-weighting decay from an aggressive exponential function to a softer hyperbolic decay (`1.0 / (1.0 + delta * ranks)`), and widened `delta` to `[0.0, 5.0]`. We also simplified the base weight transformation to `w = val ** gamma` (removing `rho`) to prevent unintended inversions from negative weights.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4337 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.5469 -> REJECTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.5695 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4337.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate implements the Rank-Weighted Diminishing Returns theory and was accepted by the gate (loss=0.4337), establishing a new running best. However, it completely misses the empirical direction in several key experiments, notably Experiments 14, 16, 21, 31, and 34. For instance, in Experiment 14, the model strongly predicts Option A (which has the highest-validity anchor feature), but human subjects predominantly choose Option B (which has slightly lower max validity but more clustered/less spread features). Because the strict cancellation of shared features leaves A with a higher-validity unique feature than B, the model is structurally forced to pick A. Similar rigidities occur in other experiments where the strict cancellation and rank-decay rules oversimplify the options.
Rationale: While staying strictly within the prescribed Rank-Weighted Diminishing Returns family, we need to add flexibility to how features are aggregated. First, remove the strict cancellation of shared features—evaluating the full profile of each option allows the rank-based decay to interact with the total number of features. Second, simplify the subjective weight transformation (e.g., remove the `rho` shift or constrain the validities more naturally) to prevent negative weights from causing unintended inversions. Third, widen the range of `delta` (e.g., [0.0, 2.0]) to allow the model to empirically discover whether returns are diminishing (<1) or increasing (>1) across ranks, which might help capture the preference for dense feature clusters without needing an explicit spread penalty.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4337 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.5469 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was REJECTED by the gate (loss increased from 0.4337 to 0.5469). By removing the strict cancellation of shared features and evaluating the full profile, the model lost its ability to properly weigh discriminative features. For example, in Experiment 7 (subset dominance), the model's accuracy collapsed from 0.7078 to 0.2528. In Experiment 24, performance dropped from 0.6726 to 0.2963. When shared features are included, the highest-validity feature often belongs to both options, assigning the largest rank-weight to a non-discriminative cue and swamping the actual differences between the options.
Rationale: The previous advice to evaluate full profiles instead of unique features was rejected by the gate because it destroys the model's discriminative power on shared-feature trials. The proposer must revert to evaluating ONLY unique features (strict cancellation of shared features). To address the failures in Experiments 14 and 16 (where multiple weaker unique features should outweigh a single stronger unique feature), change the rank-weighting decay function. Instead of the aggressive exponential decay `delta ** ranks`, use a softer hyperbolic decay such as `weight = 1.0 / (1.0 + delta * rank)`. This ensures the highest-validity unique feature still gets the maximum weight of 1.0, but allows the sum of several secondary unique features to overcome it if `delta` is small enough. Keep `delta` in `[0.0, 5.0]` and retain the simplified `w = val ** gamma` formulation.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.5469 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.5695 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current candidate was REJECTED by the gate (loss increased to 0.5695). The attempt to use a hyperbolic decay function for rank-weighted diminishing returns was too rigid. In experiments like 14, human subjects strongly prefer Option B (multiple moderate features) over Option A (a single very strong feature). By forcing the weights to strictly decay (diminishing returns), the model is structurally locked into preferring Option A, missing the empirical preference for feature clusters. We need to allow the rank-weighting mechanism to flexibly discover either diminishing OR increasing (synergistic) returns for additional features.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The previous attempt at hyperbolic decay was rejected by the gate. To capture the preference for multiple moderate features (Exp 14) while staying strictly within the prescribed Rank-Weighted family, we must give the model the mathematical flexibility to learn *increasing* marginal utility for additional unique features. Revert to the exponential rank-weighting `weights = delta ** ranks`, but expand the parameter range of `delta` to `[0.0, 3.0]`. If the optimization finds `delta > 1.0`, additional unique features will be weighted more heavily, allowing a cluster of secondary features to overcome a single strong anchor. Continue to evaluate strictly unique features (cancelling shared ones) to preserve performance on subset dominance trials (Exp 7), and keep the base validity transformation simple (`w = val ** gamma`)."
