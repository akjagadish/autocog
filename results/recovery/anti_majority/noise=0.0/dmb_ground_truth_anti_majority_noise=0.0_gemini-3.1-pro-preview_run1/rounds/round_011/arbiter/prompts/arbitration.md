# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_11" and "pi_13") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_11" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_13" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_11
Unique Features Weakest-Link: Decision-makers simplify choices by first cancelling out features shared by both options. They then evaluate each option based solely on its unique features, computing the average subjective validity of these features but applying a disproportionate penalty based on the option's 'weakest link' (the gap between its best and worst unique features).

## THEORY 2 — pi_13
Unique Features Diminishing Utility with Reference Point: Decision-makers simplify choices by cancelling out shared features, then evaluate options based solely on their unique features. Features are evaluated relative to a subjective reference point (rho), where validities below this point carry negative utility. The total additive utility of these unique features is then subjected to an exponent-based scaling (alpha), which naturally provides diminishing returns for both positive and negative accumulations of features. This captures the 'less is more' effect without mathematically dampening the penalty for negative sums.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_11)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Unique Features Weakest-Link) from the Competing Theory (Unique Features Diminishing Utility with Reference Point), we exploit two fundamental differences in how they evaluate unique features after cancellation. First, the Competing Theory integrates features additively, meaning a coalition of moderately high-validity features can overcome a single higher-validity feature; the Advocated Theory averages unique features and applies a weakest-link penalty, strictly preferring the single higher-validity feature. Second, the Competing Theory evaluates features relative to a reference point (rho), where low-validity features carry negative utility, whereas the Advocated Theory assigns positive value to any feature regardless of validity. By contrasting trials where one option accumulates multiple good features against an option with one superior feature, and trials where one option possesses a unique low-validity feature while the other has no unique features, we generate sharp, bidirectional preference reversals between the two models.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times Option B is chosen in trials where Option B is exactly identical to Option A but with one additional low-validity feature (feature 5, validity 0.55). The Advocated Theory (Unique Features Weakest-Link) evaluates this unique feature positively (as all features have positive subjective validity), thus predicting a strong preference for Option B. Conversely, the Competing Theory evaluates unique features relative to a reference point (rho, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0). Since 0.55 is typically below this reference point, the additional feature carries negative utility, leading the Competing Theory to predict a preference for Option A (the 'less is more' effect). This creates a stark, bidirectional dissociation in the predicted choice probabilities.

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Unique Features Diminishing Utility with Reference Point) from the Competing Theory (Unique Features Weakest-Link), we exploit their fundamentally different evaluations of unique features after cancellation. First, the Advocated Theory evaluates validities relative to a reference point (rho), meaning low-validity features can carry negative utility. Thus, an option with a single low-validity unique feature can be evaluated as worse than an option with no unique features at all. The Competing Theory, however, always assigns positive value to any feature, strictly preferring an option with a low-validity feature over one with none. Second, the Advocated Theory integrates unique features additively (subject to diminishing returns), allowing a coalition of lower-validity features to overcome a single higher-validity feature. The Competing Theory averages unique features and applies a weakest-link penalty based on their range, strongly penalizing coalitions and typically favoring the single higher-validity feature. By contrasting pairs where one option has only a single low-validity feature against an empty option, and pairs pitting a single high-validity feature against a coalition of multiple lower-validity features, we can cleanly separate the reference-point and additive mechanisms of the Advocated Theory from the averaging and range-penalty mechanisms of the Competing Theory.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of times subjects choose an empty option (B) over an option with only low-validity features (A). The Advocated Theory evaluates validities relative to a reference point, meaning low-validity features often yield negative utility, thus making the empty option more attractive. The Competing Theory, however, assigns positive utility to any feature, so it will almost always prefer the option with features over the empty option. Therefore, the Advocated Theory predicts a significantly higher rate of choosing B in these specific trials compared to the Competing Theory.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the experiments, we see a striking 'less is more' effect where subjects actively prefer empty options or options with fewer features over options that have additional low-validity features (e.g., Exp 1 and Exp 2). Theory 1 (pi_11) completely fails to capture this because it assigns positive value to all features, predicting that any unique feature is better than none. Theory 2 (pi_13) attempts to capture this using a reference point where low validities yield negative utility, but its mathematical implementation (diminishing returns on the sum) dilutes the effect and causes it to fail poorly on many other experiments (e.g., Exp 3, 7, 18, 23) where Theory 1's weakest-link or averaging mechanics perform very well. Neither theory adequately balances the sharp negative utility of low-validity features with the robust decision patterns seen in the broader dataset.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a new theory that combines the cancellation of shared features with a strict, threshold-based evaluation of unique features. Specifically, features above a subjective validity threshold contribute positive evidence, while features below the threshold act as negative evidence (penalties). Instead of pi_13's diminishing returns exponent, integrate these thresholded values using a simple additive or tallying mechanism, potentially incorporating a penalty for feature conflict (similar to pi_11's weakest-link but applied to the thresholded evidence). This will capture the strong preference for empty options over low-validity options while maintaining the predictive power seen in pi_11 for standard multi-feature comparisons."
