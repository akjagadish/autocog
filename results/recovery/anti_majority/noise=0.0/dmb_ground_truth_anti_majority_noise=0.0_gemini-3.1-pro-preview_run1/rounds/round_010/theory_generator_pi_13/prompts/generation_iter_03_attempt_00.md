# generation_iter_03_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_11`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_12`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_12`).

Propose a brand-new theory that retains the core, empirically supported mechanism of 'Shared Feature Cancellation' from Theory 1, but replaces the 'weakest-link' penalty with a different evaluation of the unique features. For example, a 'Unique Features Additive Utility' theory, where decision-makers cancel shared features and then sum the subjective values (potentially with diminishing returns or a compensatory tallying mechanism) of the remaining unique features. This would avoid the catastrophic failures of strict averaging while offering a stronger, more robust alternative to the weakest-link penalty for evaluating unique feature sets.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.548)

**Description**
Variance Aversion (Configural Weighting): Decision-makers evaluate options by averaging the subjective validities of their present features, but they apply a configural penalty proportional to the variance of those validities. This mechanism reflects a preference for 'holistic consistency'—options with tightly clustered, moderately high features are preferred over options with a mix of very high and very low features, as the latter are penalized for their inconsistency.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.539)

**Description**
Anchor and Adjust: Decision-makers evaluate options by first identifying the highest-validity positive feature, which serves as an anchor. Subsequent positive features adjust this anchored evaluation downwards if their validities are lower than the anchor. This explains the 'less is more' dilution effect, as adding low-validity features drags the overall evaluation down, while naturally predicting that an option with only high-validity features will be preferred over one that adds additional low-validity features (strict subset preference).

### `pi_11` (overall score: 0.511)

**Description**
Unique Features Weakest-Link: Decision-makers simplify choices by first cancelling out features shared by both options. They then evaluate each option based solely on its unique features, computing the average subjective validity of these features but applying a disproportionate penalty based on the option's 'weakest link' (the gap between its best and worst unique features).

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.5408 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3412 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.3412 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3412 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Unique Features Fractional Utility with Reference Point: Decision-makers simplify choices by cancelling out shared features, then evaluate options based solely on their unique features. Crucially, features are evaluated relative to a subjective reference point (rho); features with validity below this point carry negative utility. The total utility of unique features is then scaled by the number of unique features raised to a parameter tau, representing a fractional or generalized-average utility. This explains 'less is more' effects (strict subset preference) because adding low-validity unique features can result in negative utility, making an option with zero unique features (a strict subset) preferable.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Model expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    tau = float(parameters["tau"])
    rho = float(parameters["rho"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Cancel out shared features
    shared = (a > 0) & (b > 0)
    unique_a = a.copy()
    unique_a[shared] = 0
    unique_b = b.copy()
    unique_b[shared] = 0
    
    # Transform validities into subjective weights relative to a reference point
    # This allows low-validity features to contribute negative utility
    w = np.sign(val - rho) * (np.abs(val - rho) ** gamma)
    
    count_a = np.sum(unique_a > 0)
    count_b = np.sum(unique_b > 0)
    
    # Fractional utility of unique features
    score_a = np.sum(w[unique_a > 0]) / (count_a ** tau) if count_a > 0 else 0.0
    score_b = np.sum(w[unique_b > 0]) / (count_b ** tau) if count_b > 0 else 0.0
    
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- tau: [0.0, 2.0]
- rho: [0.5, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the critic's advice, the unique feature evaluation is modified to a fractional utility `sum(w_unique) / (count_unique ** tau)`. However, to mathematically capture the 'less is more' subset preference in Experiment 7, it is impossible for Option A (0 unique features, score 0) to beat Option B (>0 unique features) if all feature weights are strictly positive. Therefore, I also introduced a reference point parameter `rho`. Features with validities below `rho` carry negative subjective utility. When Option B has additional low-validity features, its unique feature score becomes negative, allowing the strict subset Option A (score 0) to be preferred. This fulfills the arbiter's and critic's intent for a robust alternative to the weakest-link penalty while remaining faithful to the empirical subset preference.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the arbiter's prescribed 'Shared Feature Cancellation' and 'Unique Features Additive Utility'. However, the pure additive formulation leads to catastrophic failure on several experiments, most notably Experiment 7. In Exp 7, Option A is a strict subset of Option B (meaning B has all of A's features plus additional ones). The empirical data shows subjects choose Option A 86.78% of the time, exhibiting a strong 'less is more' effect where additional low-validity features penalize the option. A strictly additive utility model guarantees B will always be chosen over A because B has a positive sum of unique features while A has zero, resulting in a simulated choice rate of only 22.39% for A. Similar failures occur in Experiments 9, 14, 21, and 22.
Rationale: To fix the failure on Exp 7 (where adding features hurts an option) while staying strictly within the arbiter's prescribed 'Unique Features' family, the evaluation of unique features must be able to penalize the addition of low-validity features. Modify the additive utility to a fractional or generalized-average utility: for example, compute `score = sum(w_unique) / (count_unique ** tau)`, where `tau` is a new free parameter (e.g., [0.0, 2.0]). When tau > 0, the model can capture the penalty of having too many weak unique features, thus explaining why a strict subset (Option A) is preferred. This provides the robust alternative to the weakest-link penalty that the arbiter requested, while gracefully handling the 'less is more' empirical pattern.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5408 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3412 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate improved the loss significantly (from 0.5408 to 0.3412) by introducing a reference point `rho` that allows low-validity features to carry negative subjective utility. This was a clever way to capture the 'less is more' effect in Experiment 7 (subset preference) within an additive framework. However, the model still underfits Experiment 7 (predicting 0.56 vs real 0.86) and several others. The issue stems from a mathematical artifact in how `rho` interacts with the fractional scaling `count_unique ** tau`. When the sum of unique feature utilities is negative, dividing it by `count_unique ** tau` (where count > 1) makes the score *less negative* (closer to 0). This creates a perverse incentive where adding more low-validity features actually reduces the penalty, dampening the very 'less is more' effect the model is trying to capture.
Rationale: To fix the mathematical artifact while staying within the prescribed mechanism family, remove the fractional scaling (`/ count_unique ** tau`) entirely. Since the reference point `rho` natively penalizes low-validity features by assigning them negative utility, a simple additive sum of these reference-shifted utilities is sufficient to capture subset aversion (Exp 7) and related phenomena. Update the score calculation to simply be the sum of the transformed weights for unique features: `score = np.sum(w[unique > 0])`. Keep the `rho` and `gamma` parameters, and ensure `rho` can span the full range of possible validities (e.g., [0.5, 1.0]). This pure reference-point additive utility will strictly penalize the accumulation of weak unique features.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3412 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.3412 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate removed the fractional scaling parameter `tau` completely, relying on a pure additive sum of reference-shifted utilities. While this eliminated the mathematical artifact of dividing a negative sum by a feature count, it failed to strictly improve the aggregate loss (rejected by the accept gate). This suggests that some form of scaling or diminishing returns on the accumulation of unique features is empirically necessary to fit the data, as the pure additive model over-penalizes or over-rewards options with many unique features.
Rationale: Since removing the scaling entirely was rejected by the gate, the proposer will automatically build on the previous accepted base (Iteration 2). To fix the perverse artifact of dividing negative sums by `count_unique ** tau` while STILL providing the necessary scaling, replace the fractional division with an exponent-based diminishing returns applied directly to the total sum. Specifically, compute the total additive utility of unique features `total_sum = sum(w_unique)`, and then apply `score = np.sign(total_sum) * (np.abs(total_sum) ** alpha)`, introducing `alpha` in [0.1, 1.0]. This naturally provides diminishing returns for both positive and negative accumulations of unique features, capturing the 'less is more' effect without mathematically dampening the penalty for negative sums.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.3412 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
