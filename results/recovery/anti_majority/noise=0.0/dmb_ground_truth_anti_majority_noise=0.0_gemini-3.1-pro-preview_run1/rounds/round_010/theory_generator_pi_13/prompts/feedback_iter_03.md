# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_11`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_12`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_12`).

Propose a brand-new theory that retains the core, empirically supported mechanism of 'Shared Feature Cancellation' from Theory 1, but replaces the 'weakest-link' penalty with a different evaluation of the unique features. For example, a 'Unique Features Additive Utility' theory, where decision-makers cancel shared features and then sum the subjective values (potentially with diminishing returns or a compensatory tallying mechanism) of the remaining unique features. This would avoid the catastrophic failures of strict averaging while offering a stronger, more robust alternative to the weakest-link penalty for evaluating unique feature sets.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Unique Features Diminishing Utility with Reference Point: Decision-makers simplify choices by cancelling out shared features, then evaluate options based solely on their unique features. Features are evaluated relative to a subjective reference point (rho), where validities below this point carry negative utility. The total additive utility of these unique features is then subjected to an exponent-based scaling (alpha), which naturally provides diminishing returns for both positive and negative accumulations of features. This captures the 'less is more' effect without mathematically dampening the penalty for negative sums.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Model expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    alpha = float(parameters["alpha"])
    rho = float(parameters["rho"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Cancel out shared features
    shared = (a > 0) & (b > 0)
    unique_a = a.copy()
    unique_a[shared] = 0
    unique_b = b.copy()
    unique_b[shared] = 0
    
    # Transform validities into subjective weights relative to a reference point
    # This allows low-validity features to contribute negative utility
    w = np.sign(val - rho) * (np.abs(val - rho) ** gamma)
    
    sum_a = np.sum(w[unique_a > 0]) if np.any(unique_a > 0) else 0.0
    sum_b = np.sum(w[unique_b > 0]) if np.any(unique_b > 0) else 0.0
    
    # Diminishing returns on the total sum of unique features
    score_a = np.sign(sum_a) * (np.abs(sum_a) ** alpha)
    score_b = np.sign(sum_b) * (np.abs(sum_b) ** alpha)
    
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- alpha: [0.1, 2.0]
- rho: [0.5, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice on Iteration 3, the fractional scaling (dividing by count ** tau) is replaced by an exponent-based diminishing returns applied directly to the total sum of unique feature utilities (np.sign(sum) * np.abs(sum) ** alpha). This prevents the mathematical artifact where adding negative utility features could paradoxically increase the score by increasing the denominator, while preserving the empirically necessary scaling and diminishing returns for accumulating multiple unique features.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.5408 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3412 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.3412 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3376 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.3376.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the arbiter's prescribed 'Shared Feature Cancellation' and 'Unique Features Additive Utility'. However, the pure additive formulation leads to catastrophic failure on several experiments, most notably Experiment 7. In Exp 7, Option A is a strict subset of Option B (meaning B has all of A's features plus additional ones). The empirical data shows subjects choose Option A 86.78% of the time, exhibiting a strong 'less is more' effect where additional low-validity features penalize the option. A strictly additive utility model guarantees B will always be chosen over A because B has a positive sum of unique features while A has zero, resulting in a simulated choice rate of only 22.39% for A. Similar failures occur in Experiments 9, 14, 21, and 22.
Rationale: To fix the failure on Exp 7 (where adding features hurts an option) while staying strictly within the arbiter's prescribed 'Unique Features' family, the evaluation of unique features must be able to penalize the addition of low-validity features. Modify the additive utility to a fractional or generalized-average utility: for example, compute `score = sum(w_unique) / (count_unique ** tau)`, where `tau` is a new free parameter (e.g., [0.0, 2.0]). When tau > 0, the model can capture the penalty of having too many weak unique features, thus explaining why a strict subset (Option A) is preferred. This provides the robust alternative to the weakest-link penalty that the arbiter requested, while gracefully handling the 'less is more' empirical pattern.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5408 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3412 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate improved the loss significantly (from 0.5408 to 0.3412) by introducing a reference point `rho` that allows low-validity features to carry negative subjective utility. This was a clever way to capture the 'less is more' effect in Experiment 7 (subset preference) within an additive framework. However, the model still underfits Experiment 7 (predicting 0.56 vs real 0.86) and several others. The issue stems from a mathematical artifact in how `rho` interacts with the fractional scaling `count_unique ** tau`. When the sum of unique feature utilities is negative, dividing it by `count_unique ** tau` (where count > 1) makes the score *less negative* (closer to 0). This creates a perverse incentive where adding more low-validity features actually reduces the penalty, dampening the very 'less is more' effect the model is trying to capture.
Rationale: To fix the mathematical artifact while staying within the prescribed mechanism family, remove the fractional scaling (`/ count_unique ** tau`) entirely. Since the reference point `rho` natively penalizes low-validity features by assigning them negative utility, a simple additive sum of these reference-shifted utilities is sufficient to capture subset aversion (Exp 7) and related phenomena. Update the score calculation to simply be the sum of the transformed weights for unique features: `score = np.sum(w[unique > 0])`. Keep the `rho` and `gamma` parameters, and ensure `rho` can span the full range of possible validities (e.g., [0.5, 1.0]). This pure reference-point additive utility will strictly penalize the accumulation of weak unique features.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3412 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.3412 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate removed the fractional scaling parameter `tau` completely, relying on a pure additive sum of reference-shifted utilities. While this eliminated the mathematical artifact of dividing a negative sum by a feature count, it failed to strictly improve the aggregate loss (rejected by the accept gate). This suggests that some form of scaling or diminishing returns on the accumulation of unique features is empirically necessary to fit the data, as the pure additive model over-penalizes or over-rewards options with many unique features.
Rationale: Since removing the scaling entirely was rejected by the gate, the proposer will automatically build on the previous accepted base (Iteration 2). To fix the perverse artifact of dividing negative sums by `count_unique ** tau` while STILL providing the necessary scaling, replace the fractional division with an exponent-based diminishing returns applied directly to the total sum. Specifically, compute the total additive utility of unique features `total_sum = sum(w_unique)`, and then apply `score = np.sign(total_sum) * (np.abs(total_sum) ** alpha)`, introducing `alpha` in [0.1, 1.0]. This naturally provides diminishing returns for both positive and negative accumulations of unique features, capturing the 'less is more' effect without mathematically dampening the penalty for negative sums.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.3412 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3376 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate was ACCEPTED by the gate, as the exponent-based diminishing returns successfully resolved the mathematical artifact of the fractional scaling, improving the aggregate loss to 0.3376. The model successfully captures the qualitative direction of the 'less is more' effect (e.g., Experiment 7, where it predicts subset preference). However, the model systematically under-predicts the magnitude of strong empirical preferences. For instance, in Experiment 7, the real preference for Option A is 86.78%, but the model only predicts 58.33%. Similarly, in Experiment 21, the real preference is 81.75% while the model predicts 54.06%. This flattening of choice probabilities towards 0.5 across multiple experiments suggests that the model's noise parameter (epsilon) is absorbing too much variance, preventing the deterministic part of the softmax from expressing strong preferences.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "To fix the under-prediction of extreme choice probabilities (Experiments 7, 11, 16, 21) while strictly maintaining the current 'Shared Feature Cancellation' and 'Unique Features Diminishing Utility' mechanism, tighten the range of the lapse rate `epsilon`. Currently, `epsilon` can range up to 0.5, which artificially caps the maximum choice probability and flattens the model's predictions. Restrict the `epsilon` bounds to [0.0, 0.1] or [0.0, 0.2]. This minor adjustment will force the optimizer to rely on the core utility differences (via `beta`, `gamma`, and `rho`) to fit the variance, allowing the model to reach the ~80-85% choice probabilities observed in the empirical data."
