# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Averaging Model from the Anchor and Adjust Model, we exploit their different weighting of features. While both models predict a 'dilution effect' (where adding lower-validity features reduces an option's overall value), they differ fundamentally in how they integrate multiple features. The Anchor and Adjust model places disproportionate weight on the single highest-validity positive feature (the anchor), with all other features merely adjusting this anchor. The Averaging model weighs all positive features equally when computing the mean. We design trials where Option A has a very high-validity anchor but is dragged down by multiple low-validity features, while Option B lacks the top anchor but consists of tightly clustered, moderately high-validity features. The Anchor and Adjust model will often prefer Option A due to the strong anchor dominating the evaluation, whereas the Averaging model will consistently prefer Option B due to its higher overall mean validity.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Averaging Model: Decision-makers evaluate options not by summing the evidence (additive) or relying on a single best cue (lexicographic), but by averaging the subjective validities of all positive features present in an option. This mechanism naturally accounts for the 'dilution effect', where adding a positive but low-validity feature to an option can actually decrease its overall subjective value and choice probability.

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [1.0, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 15.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Model expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Transform validities to subjective weights
    w = val ** gamma
    
    # Count positive features
    k_a = np.sum(a)
    k_b = np.sum(b)
    
    # Calculate average validity of positive features (0 if no positive features)
    score_a = np.sum(w * a) / k_a if k_a > 0 else 0.0
    score_b = np.sum(w * b) / k_b if k_b > 0 else 0.0
    
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Softmax choice rule
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)

    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Anchor and Adjust: Decision-makers evaluate options by first identifying the highest-validity positive feature, which serves as an anchor. Subsequent positive features adjust this anchored evaluation downwards if their validities are lower than the anchor. This explains the 'less is more' dilution effect, as adding low-validity features drags the overall evaluation down, while naturally predicting that an option with only high-validity features will be preferred over one that adds additional low-validity features (strict subset preference).

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- alpha: [0.0, 50.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

## Response

```json
{
  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    # Identify trials where Option A has the highest-validity feature (index 0) and Option B does not.\n    a_has_best = data['option_a_ratings'].apply(lambda x: x[0] == 1)\n    b_has_best = data['option_b_ratings'].apply(lambda x: x[0] == 1)\n    mask = a_has_best & ~b_has_best\n    \n    if mask.sum() == 0:\n        return 0.0\n        \n    # Return the proportion of times the subject chose Option B (response == 1)\n    # despite Option A having the best possible feature.\n    return float(data.loc[mask, 'response'].mean())",
  "rationale": "The Anchor and Adjust model postulates that decision-makers anchor heavily on the single highest-validity positive feature. In trials where Option A possesses this top feature (feature 0) and Option B does not, the Anchor and Adjust model will strongly bias towards Option A. The Averaging model, on the other hand, evaluates the mean validity of all positive features, making it much more willing to choose Option B if its features are consistently moderately high while Option A's are diluted by low-validity features. This metric computes the rate of choosing Option B in such trials, expecting a higher value for the Averaging model."
