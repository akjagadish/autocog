# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_3") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_3
Decision-makers integrate all available features to evaluate options, weighting each feature according to its subjective importance. This Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy computes a compensatory score for each option by summing the feature values multiplied by their normalized subjective weights. The subjective weights are modeled as the provided feature validities raised to a power 'gamma', which allows the model to smoothly interpolate between Tallying (gamma = 0, equal weights) and Take The Best (large gamma, where the highest validity cue dominates). Choice probabilities are then generated via a softmax function over the options' scores, subject to random lapses.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from Weighted Additive (WADD) models, we use a 5-feature design with a linear spread of validities. The trials are constructed to pit the single highest-validity discriminating cue against a coalition of multiple lower-validity cues. TTB, being a non-compensatory 'one-reason' heuristic, will consistently choose the option favored by the single highest-validity discriminating cue, ignoring all others. WADD, being compensatory, integrates all cues and (unless the exponent gamma is extremely high) will often favor the option supported by the combination of multiple lower-validity cues. By varying the position of the discriminating cue and the number of opposing cues, we can map out the precise compensatory threshold and robustly distinguish TTB's lexicographic choice pattern from WADD's integration.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic. The experimental trials are specifically designed such that the single highest-validity discriminating cue points in the opposite direction of the sum of the remaining lower-validity cues. Consequently, the TTB theory predicts a high match rate (close to 1, subject to noise), while the Weighted Additive (WADD) theory, which integrates all cues, will typically predict the opposite choice (yielding a low match rate, unless its exponent parameter is extremely high). This creates a stark and highly reliable contrast between the two models.

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Weighted Additive (WADD) model from Take The Best (TTB), this design uses 5 features with linearly decreasing validities. The trials are constructed to systematically pit the single highest-validity discriminating cue against a coalition of multiple lower-validity cues. TTB, being non-compensatory, will consistently choose the option favored by the single highest-validity discriminating cue, ignoring the rest. WADD, being compensatory, integrates all cues and will often favor the option supported by the combination of multiple lower-validity cues (depending on the value of gamma). By varying the position of the discriminating cue (e.g., cue 1 vs. cues 2-5, or cue 2 vs. cues 3-5) and the number of opposing cues, we can robustly distinguish TTB's lexicographic choice pattern from WADD's integration.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The experimental design pits a single high-validity cue against a coalition of multiple lower-validity cues in trials 1-8. In all of these diagnostic trials, the option favored by the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic is strictly the one with FEWER total positive features. TTB will therefore consistently avoid the option with more positive features. In contrast, the Weighted Additive (WADD) model integrates all cues; for low-to-moderate values of gamma, the coalition of lower-validity cues overpowers the single high-validity cue, leading WADD to choose the option with MORE total positive features. By measuring the proportion of trials where subjects choose the option with the greater sum of features (on trials where the sums differ), we cleanly separate the non-compensatory, lexicographic choices of TTB (score near 0) from the compensatory, integrative choices of WADD (score significantly higher).

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all four experiments, Theory 2 (Weighted Additive, pi_3) consistently outperforms Theory 1 (Take The Best, pi_1). The observed data shows a blend of non-compensatory (lexicographic) and compensatory (integrative) choices. TTB strictly predicts lexicographic choices, resulting in overestimating TTB match rates (Exp 1 and 3) and underestimating compensatory choices (Exp 2 and 4). WADD, through its 'gamma' parameter, can smoothly interpolate between equal weighting and lexicographic weighting, thereby capturing the aggregate choice probabilities much more accurately. Because TTB is too rigid as a universal model for this domain, it should be replaced with a theory that can account for the heterogeneity in decision strategies.",

  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Strategy Repertoire' or 'Mixture' theory. Instead of assuming all subjects use a single deterministic heuristic (like pure TTB), this theory should posit that individuals draw from a toolbox of heuristics (e.g., Take The Best and Tallying). On any given trial (or for any given subject), the decision maker applies TTB with probability P_TTB, and a compensatory heuristic like Tallying or WADD with probability 1 - P_TTB. This mixture approach will naturally capture the intermediate aggregate statistics observed across the experiments, providing a stronger competitor to the WADD model by explicitly modeling strategy heterogeneity."
