## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_11` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Unique Features Weakest-Link: Decision-makers simplify choices by first cancelling out features shared by both options. They then evaluate each option based solely on its unique features, computing the average subjective validity of these features but applying a disproportionate penalty based on the option's 'weakest link' (the gap between its best and worst unique features).

**Rationale:** The theory posits that decision-makers first simplify choices by cancelling out any features shared by both options, a process known as cue-cancellation. After stripping away these commonalities, they evaluate the remaining unique features of each option. This evaluation is based on the average subjective validity of the unique features, but is heavily penalized by the 'weakest link' (the lowest validity unique feature) relative to the best unique feature. This theory elegantly explains why adding shared features has no effect on choice probabilities (solving Experiment 17, where the prior Weakest Link model failed catastrophically) while naturally capturing the variance-aversion and dilution effects observed in other experiments through the weakest-link penalty applied to unique features.

### slot 2 — `pi_14` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Thresholded Unique Features with Spread Penalty: Decision-makers simplify choices by cancelling out shared features, then evaluate the unique features relative to a subjective validity threshold. Features above the threshold provide positive evidence, while those below act as penalties. These values are integrated additively, but options with multiple unique features suffer a conflict penalty proportional to the spread (max - min) of their thresholded validities. This penalizes options with a wide variance in their unique features while strictly preserving shared-feature cancellation.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice on the iter 1 base, we redefine the 'conflict' penalty. Instead of using the raw minimum of the thresholded weights (which could be positive and thus act as a boost), we define conflict as the spread (max - min) of the thresholded evidence among the unique active features. We subtract this spread penalty from the base additive score only when there are multiple unique features. This strictly penalizes options with a wide variance in their unique features, ensuring it always acts as a penalty, while perfectly preserving the shared-feature cancellation required to fit Experiments 17, 19, and 20.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `rho`: `[0.0, 1.0]`

## Replacement

### `pi_15` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Strict Diminishing Returns on Absolute Subjective Utility: Decision-makers evaluate options by first cancelling out shared features. They then assess the unique features relative to a subjective validity threshold, where features below the threshold act as negative evidence (penalties). To reflect limited attention capacity, these features are ranked by their absolute utility (magnitude of impact, whether positive or negative), and their contribution is heavily discounted by a strict diminishing returns multiplier based on their rank.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's diagnosis, we enforce strict diminishing returns by restricting `delta` to `[0.0, 1.0]`, completely removing the unintended synergy loophole. To implement the attention capacity mechanism faithfully, unique features are now ranked by their absolute thresholded utility (`np.abs(active_w)`) descending, ensuring the most impactful features (whether strong evidence or strong penalties) are processed first and suffer the least discounting. To compensate for the loss of synergy and provide enough flexibility to fit the data, we widen the threshold `rho` to `[0.0, 2.0]` and `gamma` to `[0.1, 20.0]`.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `rho`: `[0.0, 2.0]`
  - `delta`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
