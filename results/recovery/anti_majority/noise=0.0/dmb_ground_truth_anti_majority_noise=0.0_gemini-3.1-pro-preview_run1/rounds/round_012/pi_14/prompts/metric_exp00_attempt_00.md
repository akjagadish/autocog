# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate the Advocated Theory (Thresholded Unique Features with Spread Penalty) from the Competing Theory (Unique Features Weakest-Link), we exploit their fundamentally different treatments of unique features after cancellation. The Advocated Theory integrates features additively but subjects them to a validity threshold (rho), meaning low-validity features can act as penalties (negative utility). In contrast, the Competing Theory evaluates options by the average validity of their unique features and always treats any feature as positive evidence. We construct trials that contrast an option with no unique features against an option with a single low-validity unique feature; the Advocated Theory will often prefer the empty option (due to the low-validity feature acting as a penalty), whereas the Competing Theory will strictly prefer the option with the single feature. Furthermore, we pit a single high-validity feature against a coalition of multiple moderately high-validity features. The additive nature of the Advocated Theory allows the coalition to overcome the single best feature, while the averaging nature and weakest-link penalty of the Competing Theory will strongly favor the single high-validity feature.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Thresholded Unique Features with Spread Penalty: Decision-makers simplify choices by cancelling out shared features, then evaluate the unique features relative to a subjective validity threshold. Features above the threshold provide positive evidence, while those below act as penalties. These values are integrated additively, but options with multiple unique features suffer a conflict penalty proportional to the spread (max - min) of their thresholded validities. This penalizes options with a wide variance in their unique features while strictly preserving shared-feature cancellation.

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- rho: [0.0, 1.0]
- lambda_penalty: [0.0, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Unique Features Weakest-Link: Decision-makers simplify choices by first cancelling out features shared by both options. They then evaluate each option based solely on its unique features, computing the average subjective validity of these features but applying a disproportionate penalty based on the option's 'weakest link' (the gap between its best and worst unique features).

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- lambda_weak: [0.0, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "In Trials 1 and 2, after cancelling shared features, Option A has no unique features while Option B has exactly one low-validity unique feature (the 5th feature). The Advocated Theory subtracts a subjective threshold (rho) from each feature's validity, meaning a low-validity feature can act as a penalty (negative evidence). Consequently, the Advocated Theory will frequently prefer Option A (score 0) over Option B (negative score). In contrast, the Competing Theory evaluates options by the average validity of their unique features; since Option B's single unique feature has a positive validity (and suffers no spread penalty), the Competing Theory will strictly prefer Option B over Option A, choosing Option A only due to noise. This metric calculates the proportion of times Option A is chosen in these two trials, which should be substantially higher under the Advocated Theory."
