# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_11`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_14`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_11`).

Propose a new theory that retains the core insight of a subjective feature-validity threshold (where low-validity features act as negative evidence/penalties, explaining the strong preference for empty options in Exps 2 and 26). However, instead of Theory 2's 'spread penalty', introduce a 'diminishing returns' or 'attention capacity' mechanism for additive integration. For example, decision-makers might rank the unique features by their absolute thresholded utility and heavily discount the contribution of lower-ranked features. This would explain why coalitions of moderate features sometimes fail to overcome a single strong feature, providing a stronger and more cognitively plausible competitor to Theory 2.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Rank-Dependent Subjective Utility with Synergy: Decision-makers evaluate options by first cancelling out shared features. They then evaluate the unique features relative to a subjective validity threshold, where features below the threshold act as negative evidence (penalties). Features are ranked by their raw subjective utility (highest validity first), and their impact is scaled by a rank-dependent multiplier. This multiplier can reflect diminishing returns (attention decay) or increasing returns (synergy), allowing the model to flexibly capture both Take-The-Best-like behavior and strong preferences for coalitions of moderate features.

`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- rho: [0.0, 1.0]
- delta: [0.0, 5.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, we widen the range of `delta` to `[0.0, 5.0]` to allow for 'increasing returns' (synergy) when processing multiple features. This allows the model to capture the empirical preference for feature coalitions (Exps 11, 14, 16) rather than being mathematically forced to prefer a single strong feature. We also changed the ranking scheme to sort by raw subjective utility descending (highest validity first) instead of absolute magnitude. This ensures positive evidence is evaluated first, while negative evidence (low validity features) accumulates at higher ranks, leading to synergistic penalties if `delta > 1.0`, nicely preserving the strong aversion to non-diagnostic features seen in Exps 2 and 26.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3233 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2649 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.2649.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the arbiter's requested 'attention capacity' / diminishing returns mechanism, applying it to thresholded unique features. This yields a good fit for experiments like 1, 2, and 26, effectively capturing the penalty for low-validity features. However, the model struggles severely with experiments where subjects actually prefer coalitions of moderate features over a single strong feature (e.g., Exp 11, Exp 14). In Exp 14, real subjects strongly prefer the clustered/coalition option (B), but the model's heavy discounting of lower-ranked features forces it to prefer the option with the single highest validity (A), resulting in a reversed prediction (real=0.84, sim=0.17).
Rationale: The candidate strictly follows the prescribed mechanism family but the strict diminishing returns (delta <= 1.0) mathematically forces the model to prefer single strong features over coalitions, contradicting the empirical data in Exps 11, 14, and 16. To fix this within the same family, widen the range of the `delta` parameter to [0.0, 3.0] or [0.1, 5.0] so the model can learn 'increasing returns' (synergy) for lower-ranked active features if the data demands it. Additionally, consider whether ranking by absolute subjective utility is too disruptive when positive and negative utilities are mixed; it may be more stable to rank by raw validity or to separate the attention pools for positive and negative evidence.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3233 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2649 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate successfully widened the `delta` parameter and changed the ranking to raw subjective utility, which improved aggregate loss significantly (0.3233 -> 0.2649). This allowed the model to capture the synergy of feature coalitions better, as seen in the massive improvement on Exp 16 (from 0.40 to 0.73). However, the model still heavily misses Exp 14 (real=0.84, sim=0.18) and underpredicts Exp 11 (real=0.74, sim=0.50). The core issue is the 'cancellation of shared features' step. In Exp 14, options A and B share most of their features, but B's are more clustered. By cancelling shared features, the model reduces the comparison to just the unshared features (where A has a single higher-validity feature than B), guaranteeing that A wins regardless of the synergy parameter `delta`. Synergy is a property of the *entire* coalition of features an option possesses, and cancelling shared features artificially breaks these coalitions apart before synergy can be computed.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate is strictly within the prescribed family and the previous parameter expansion worked well. To fix the remaining failures in coalition-preference experiments (Exps 11, 14), remove the 'cancellation of shared features' step. The rank-dependent multiplier (synergy/decay) should be applied to the full set of an option's active features so that the gestalt of the coalition is preserved. Keep the rest of the mechanism (thresholding, ranking by raw subjective utility, and the widened delta range) intact."
