# Round 6 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_8` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Variance Aversion (Configural Weighting): Decision-makers evaluate options by averaging the subjective validities of their present features, but they apply a configural penalty proportional to the variance of those validities. This mechanism reflects a preference for 'holistic consistency'—options with tightly clustered, moderately high features are preferred over options with a mix of very high and very low features, as the latter are penalized for their inconsistency.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory implements a Variance Aversion model. It evaluates options by taking the average subjective validity of their present features and subtracting a penalty proportional to the variance of those validities. This effectively captures subjects' preference for options with consistently moderate-to-high features over those with an extreme mix of high and low validities, explaining the strong deviations from Take-The-Best in Experiments 11 and 12, while also naturally predicting the dilution effect and strict subset preferences seen in Experiment 7.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `lambda_var`: `[0.0, 20.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`

### slot 2 — `pi_7` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Anchor and Adjust: Decision-makers evaluate options by first identifying the highest-validity positive feature, which serves as an anchor. Subsequent positive features adjust this anchored evaluation downwards if their validities are lower than the anchor. This explains the 'less is more' dilution effect, as adding low-validity features drags the overall evaluation down, while naturally predicting that an option with only high-validity features will be preferred over one that adds additional low-validity features (strict subset preference).

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the Anchor and Adjust model successfully captures the subset preferences (Experiment 7) but under-predicts the strength of the dilution effect in Experiments 9 and 10. To allow the model to more strongly weight the adjusting (lower validity) features and achieve heavier dilution, I have expanded the upper bound of the `alpha` parameter from 5.0 to 50.0. I also expanded the `beta` range to 50.0 to allow for sharper choices when scores are heavily diluted.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `alpha`: `[0.0, 50.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

### `pi_9` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Weakest Link (Worst-Case Focus): Decision-makers evaluate an option primarily by averaging the subjective validities of its present features, but they apply a disproportionate penalty based on the option's 'weakest link' (the lowest validity active feature). Specifically, the penalty is proportional to the gap between the option's best feature and its weakest feature. This cognitive mechanism reflects a worst-case focus where attention is drawn to the most inferior attribute, naturally predicting both the dilution effect (adding weak features reduces the mean and increases the weakest-link penalty) and variance aversion (options with tighter feature clusters have smaller weakest-link penalties).

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's recommendation, this theory implements a 'Weakest Link' mechanism. Instead of computing a global mathematical variance across all active features (which may be cognitively implausible), decision-makers anchor on the average quality of the option but are heavily influenced by the worst-case feature (the lowest validity active feature). The penalty is formalized as the gap between the maximum and minimum active validities. This naturally captures the dilution effect (adding a low-validity feature drastically pulls down the minimum and the mean) and variance aversion (options with high variance have a larger gap between their best and weakest links, leading to a larger penalty), providing a strong mechanistic competitor to holistic variance computation.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `lambda_weak`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
