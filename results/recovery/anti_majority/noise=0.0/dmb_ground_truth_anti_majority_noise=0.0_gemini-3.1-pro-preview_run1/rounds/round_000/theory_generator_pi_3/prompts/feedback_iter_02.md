# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace Tallying with a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. Unlike TTB (which strictly strictly stops at the first discriminating cue) and Tallying (which counts all cues equally regardless of validity), WADD assumes decision-makers integrate all available features but weight them according to their validities (or derived subjective weights). This compensatory model can capture behavior that is primarily driven by high-validity cues (mimicking TTB) but occasionally swayed by a large coalition of lower-validity cues, potentially explaining the slight gap between pure TTB predictions and observed data.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Decision-makers integrate all available features to evaluate options, weighting each feature according to its subjective importance. This Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy computes a compensatory score for each option by summing the feature values multiplied by their normalized subjective weights. The subjective weights are modeled as the provided feature validities raised to a power 'gamma', which allows the model to smoothly interpolate between Tallying (gamma = 0, equal weights) and Take The Best (large gamma, where the highest validity cue dominates). Choice probabilities are then generated via a softmax function over the options' scores, subject to random lapses.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Compute subjective weights by raising validities to the power of gamma
    w = val ** gamma
    # Normalize weights to decouple gamma (cue dominance) from beta (choice determinism)
    if np.sum(w) > 0:
        w = w / np.sum(w)
    
    # Calculate Weighted Additive (WADD) scores for both options
    score_a = np.sum(w * a)
    score_b = np.sum(w * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.0, 50.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Implemented the critic's suggestion to increase the upper bounds of `gamma` and `beta` from 20.0 to 50.0. Because the subjective weights are normalized to sum to 1, the maximum possible difference between WADD scores is bounded by 1.0, and in practice is often much smaller. Expanding the parameter bounds allows the optimizer to find sharper step-functions for cue dominance (via higher gamma) and steeper softmax curves (via higher beta), providing the headroom needed to perfectly match the high levels of TTB conformity and low levels of Tallying conformity observed in the experimental data.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1737 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1699 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0542 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0542.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate WADD model successfully bridges the gap between TTB and Tallying, achieving a much better aggregate loss (0.1737) and being accepted by the gate. However, it still under-predicts TTB conformity in Experiment 1 (0.67 vs 0.76) and over-predicts Tallying conformity in Experiment 2 (0.40 vs 0.25). This suggests the model needs to be able to act slightly more deterministically or with a stronger skew towards the best cues (higher effective gamma and beta).
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED, meaning WADD is the right family. To improve the fit further, normalize the subjective weights before computing the scores: `w = w / np.sum(w)`. Currently, because validities are fractions < 1, raising them to a large `gamma` makes the weights (and thus the scores) vanishingly small. This forces `beta` to be excessively large just to maintain the same level of determinism, entangling the two parameters. Normalizing the weights will decouple `gamma` (which controls cue dominance) from `beta` (which controls choice determinism) and allow the optimizer to find the exact blend needed to match the observed 0.76 / 0.25 conformity rates.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1737 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1699 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate WADD model with normalized weights was ACCEPTED, improving the aggregate loss to 0.1699. This confirms that decoupling the cue dominance (gamma) from choice determinism (beta) was the right structural move. However, looking at the experiment-level metrics, the model still under-predicts TTB conformity in Experiment 1 (0.66 vs 0.76) and over-predicts Tallying conformity in Experiment 2 (0.38 vs 0.25). Because the weights are now strictly normalized to sum to 1, the difference between scores is bounded and often quite small. The current parameter upper bounds (gamma=20, beta=20) may be artificially restricting the model from achieving the sharp determinism needed to match the human data.
Rationale: The weight normalization successfully improved the aggregate loss, but the model still needs to act more deterministically and with stronger cue dominance to match the 0.76 / 0.25 conformity rates. Because the weights are now normalized to sum to 1, the maximum possible difference in scores between options is 1.0, and in practice it is often much smaller. To allow the model to reach the required level of determinism, increase the upper bounds of both `gamma` and `beta` to 50.0. This minor adjustment will give the optimizer the headroom it needs to find the sharper step-function for cue dominance and the steeper softmax curve required to fit the empirical data perfectly.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1699 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0542 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate WADD model, with the expanded parameter bounds for `gamma` and `beta`, has achieved an excellent fit to the empirical data. The aggregate loss dropped dramatically from 0.1699 to 0.0542. In Experiment 1, the model predicts a TTB conformity rate of 0.7467, which is extremely close to the observed 0.7675. In Experiment 2, it predicts a Tallying conformity rate of 0.3121, closely approximating the observed 0.2552. The structural adjustment to normalize subjective weights combined with the expanded parameter ranges successfully allowed the model to find the correct balance between cue dominance and choice determinism.",
