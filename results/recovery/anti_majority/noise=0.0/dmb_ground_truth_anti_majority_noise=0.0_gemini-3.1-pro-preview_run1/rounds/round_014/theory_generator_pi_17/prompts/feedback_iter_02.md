# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_16`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_14`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_16`).

Theory 1 is degenerate because its core mechanism (penalizing standard deviation of feature validities) was falsified by its own proposed experiment, with subjects instead behaving in accordance with Theory 2's spread (max-min) penalty. Propose a brand-new theory to replace Theory 1. Instead of tweaking variance penalties, the new theory should explore a fundamentally different cognitive mechanism. For example, consider a Sequential Sampling or Lexicographic Semi-Order model where decision-makers compare features one by one in order of validity, but only stop if the difference in validities exceeds a subjective threshold (otherwise they tally the remaining features). Alternatively, explore a theory based on Diminishing Marginal Utility for additional features, where the first unique feature provides full evidence but subsequent unique features are heavily discounted, explaining why options with many weak features lose to options with one strong feature without requiring a 'conflict' penalty.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Diminishing Marginal Utility with Baseline Cost and Independent Discounting: Decision-makers evaluate all features of an option. Each feature's validity is transformed and reduced by a baseline cost 'C'. Features above 'C' provide positive utility, while those below act as negative utility (penalties). To reflect limited attention, positive and negative features are sorted independently by their magnitude (strongest positive first, strongest negative first) and discounted exponentially based on their rank. This ensures that prominent negative features strongly penalize an option, allowing options with many weak features to consistently lose to strict subsets of strong features.

- c: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, we modified the sorting and discounting mechanism to apply independently to positive and negative features. Instead of sorting all features by absolute magnitude (which pushes weak negative features to the bottom where they are heavily discounted), we separate features into positive (v_trans > 0) and negative (v_trans < 0). We sort the positive features descending and the negative features ascending (most negative first), and apply the delta^rank discount to each set separately before summing. This ensures that weak features properly and consistently penalize an option, improving the model's predictions on experiments where multiple weak features hurt an option's overall appeal.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.5406 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3379 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3259 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.3259.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The proposed Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU) model captures some baseline effects but completely fails on experiments where options with fewer features outcompete options with more features (e.g., Experiment 7, 9, 10, 11). In Experiment 7, Option A is a strict subset of Option B (e.g., A has one strong feature, B has the same strong feature plus several weak features), yet humans overwhelmingly prefer A. Because the current DMU model strictly adds positive value for every feature, it always assigns a higher score to the option with more features, predicting B > A. To explain why adding weak features hurts an option's appeal without abandoning the DMU framework, the model needs a mechanism where weak features provide negative marginal utility.
Rationale: Keep the DMU mechanism but make two minor adjustments to fix the subset/weak-feature penalty failures. First, DO NOT cancel shared features; evaluate the full feature set of each option so the rank-ordering is preserved globally. Second, introduce a cognitive cost or baseline parameter `C` (range [0.0, 1.0]) subtracted from the transformed validities BEFORE discounting. The value of a feature becomes `(v_trans - C)`. Sort these values in descending order of absolute magnitude or just standard descending order, and apply the `delta^rank` discount. This allows weak features (where v_trans < C) to contribute negatively to the total score, perfectly explaining why adding weak features to a strong option reduces its overall value and causes it to lose to a strict subset.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5406 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3379 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The introduction of a cognitive cost 'C' and negative utility successfully improved the model's performance on subset experiments (like Experiment 7), where options with fewer features outcompete those with more, and reduced overestimation in Experiments 9 and 10. However, the model still significantly underestimates human performance in Experiments 11, 14, 16, 21, and 30. A key issue lies in how the features are ranked and discounted. Currently, features are sorted by their absolute magnitude `|v_trans - c|`. A weak feature that falls just below 'c' will have a very small absolute magnitude, placing it at the bottom of the rank order. As a result, it gets heavily discounted by `delta^rank` and barely penalizes the option. To properly capture the penalty of multiple weak features (as seen in Exp 14 and 16), the discounting should be applied to positive and negative features independently.
Rationale: Keep the Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU) and baseline cost 'C' framework, but fix the sorting and discounting mechanism. Instead of sorting all features by absolute magnitude together, separate the features into positive evidence (`v_trans - c > 0`) and negative evidence (`v_trans - c < 0`). Sort the positive features descending by value and apply the `delta^rank` discount. Sort the negative features ascending (most negative first, i.e., by absolute magnitude) and apply the `delta^rank` discount to them separately. Then sum both discounted components. This ensures that the most prominent negative features (the ones that fall furthest below C) are not washed out by being placed at the bottom of a global absolute-magnitude list, allowing weak features to properly and consistently penalize an option.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3379 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3259 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The independent discounting of positive and negative features improved the aggregate loss and helped the model capture some subset and penalty effects. However, the model still severely underpredicts the magnitude of human behavior in experiments where weak features are highly detrimental (e.g., Experiments 11, 14, 16, 21, 28, and 30). In these experiments, human choice proportions are often >0.80, whereas the model predicts values near 0.45. This indicates that while the negative features are now being correctly isolated and discounted, their overall impact on the final score is too weak to drive decisive softmax probabilities.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the current Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU) framework with independent sorting and discounting for positive and negative features. To fix the underestimation of penalties from weak features, introduce a 'loss aversion' or penalty-weight multiplier (e.g., `weight_neg` in [0.1, 10.0]). Multiply the sum of the discounted negative features by this `weight_neg` parameter before combining it with the positive score. This minor adjustment allows the model to asymmetrically amplify the negative utility of features that fall below the baseline cost 'C', capturing the strong human aversion to options with multiple weak features and pushing the choice probabilities closer to the extreme values seen in the empirical data."
