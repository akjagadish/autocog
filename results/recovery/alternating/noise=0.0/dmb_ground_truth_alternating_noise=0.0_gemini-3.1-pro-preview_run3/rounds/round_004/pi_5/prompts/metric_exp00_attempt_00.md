# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** Both the Spatial Bias (advocated) and Strict Alternation (competing) theories assume that subjects completely ignore the stimulus features and rely entirely on response heuristics. The key difference is that Strict Alternation predicts a deterministic, rigid alternation sequence with exactly zero overall spatial bias (50% A, 50% B), whereas the Spatial Bias model accommodates a probabilistic combination of spatial preference (e.g., favoring Option A) and sequential dependence (either repeating or alternating). To ensure that any observed spatial bias or repetition tendency is purely response-driven and not an artifact of the stimuli, we use a perfectly symmetric and counterbalanced set of trial pairs. Every feature configuration presented for Option A is also presented identically for Option B across the experiment. This guarantees that any feature-based strategy would result in a 50/50 overall choice rate and zero sequential dependence, allowing us to unambiguously dissociate the probabilistic spatial and repetition biases of the advocated theory from the rigid deterministic alternation of the competing theory.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Response Heuristic / Spatial Bias: Subjects in these paradigms often ignore feature information entirely and instead rely on presentation-based response heuristics. Decision-making is driven by a persistent spatial bias (e.g., a preference for Option A over Option B) combined with a sequential dependence, such as a tendency to repeat the previous choice or alternate between options. This produces behavior that appears random with respect to cue validities but contains structured autocorrelation and spatial preference.

**Parameters:**
- beta_bias: [-3.0, 3.0]
- beta_repeat: [-3.0, 3.0]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    beta_bias = float(parameters["beta_bias"])
    beta_repeat = float(parameters["beta_repeat"])
    
    # Determine the indicator for the previous choice
    # 1.0 if Option A was chosen, -1.0 if Option B was chosen, 0.0 if first trial
    if len(history["response"]) == 0:
        last_a = 0.0
    else:
        last_a = 1.0 if history["response"][-1] == 0 else -1.0
        
    # Logit for choosing Option A
    z = beta_bias + beta_repeat * last_a
    
    # Convert to probability using sigmoid
    p_a = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-z))
    
    return np.array([p_a, 1.0 - p_a])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=float)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Strict Alternation: Subjects in these experimental paradigms ignore all feature information and simply alternate their choices between Option A and Option B deterministically on every trial. This response heuristic reflects a complete lack of engagement with the stimulus validities, substituting a simple motor-alternation pattern.

**Parameters:**
- dummy: [0.0, 1.0]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Reference the dummy parameter to satisfy the parameter usage constraint
    _ = float(parameters["dummy"])
    
    # If first trial, guess randomly to start the sequence
    if len(history["response"]) == 0:
        return np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    # Otherwise, strictly alternate from the last response
    last_response = history["response"][-1]
    if last_response == 0:
        return np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        return np.array([1.0, 0.0])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=float)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

## Response

```json

  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    import numpy as np\n    def subj_alt(df):\n        resp = df['response'].values\n        if len(resp) < 2:\n            return 0.0\n        return np.mean(resp[1:] != resp[:-1])\n    return data.groupby('subject_id').apply(subj_alt).mean()",
  "rationale": "The Competing Theory predicts that subjects will strictly alternate their choices between Option A and Option B on every single trial. Therefore, the alternation rate (the proportion of trials where the current choice differs from the previous choice) will be exactly 1.0 for all subjects under this theory. In contrast, the Advocated Theory posits a probabilistic combination of spatial bias and sequential dependence, resulting in alternation rates that vary widely across subjects based on their individual parameters (typically averaging around 0.5). Measuring the mean alternation rate will unambiguously separate the rigid deterministic behavior of the Competing Theory from the flexible probabilistic behavior of the Advocated Theory."
