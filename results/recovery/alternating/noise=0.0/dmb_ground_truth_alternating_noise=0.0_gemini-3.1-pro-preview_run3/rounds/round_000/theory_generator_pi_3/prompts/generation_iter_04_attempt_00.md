# generation_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. Unlike Tallying (which gives equal weight to all cues) or TTB (which only uses the single best discriminating cue), WADD assumes subjects compute a weighted sum of the features for each option, where the weights are proportional to the cues' validities or their log-odds. This provides a formal compensatory model that scales with both cue validity and the number of cues, offering a more realistic alternative to the non-compensatory TTB.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.5618 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3418 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.2387 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4: loss=0.2203 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 4 at loss=0.2203 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Weighted Additive (WADD) model with non-linear validity scaling and extended lapse rate: Decision makers evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their feature values. The weights are formed by taking the cue validities (or their log-odds) and raising them to a power gamma, which allows the model to interpolate between equal-weighting, proportional weighting, and non-compensatory behavior. To account for the high degree of noise or chance-level behavior observed in specific paradigms, the lapse rate (epsilon) can range up to 1.0, and beta down to 0.0, allowing the model to capture completely random guessing natively.

`rationale`: Following the critic's advice, we expanded the lower bound of the beta parameter to 0.0 to natively allow for perfectly flat random guessing (0.5/0.5 choice probabilities) without relying exclusively on the epsilon lapse rate. Additionally, we expanded the upper bound of gamma to 10.0 to ensure the model can capture strictly non-compensatory behavior for sub-populations that do utilize cues.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate WADD model was accepted and provides a baseline for a compensatory strategy. However, it currently misses the empirical targets significantly. In Experiment 1, humans match the TTB prediction exactly 50% of the time (metric = 0.5000, var = 0.0000), whereas the candidate yields 0.3515. In Experiment 2, humans show almost no difference in choosing the top-cue winner whether the tally strongly agrees or disagrees (metric = -0.0237), whereas the candidate yields a large positive difference (0.5571), indicating it is far too sensitive to the tally of remaining cues.
Rationale: To better capture the human data within the prescribed WADD family, the model needs more flexibility in how cue validities are translated into weights. Currently, it strictly uses either raw validities or log-odds. Introduce a non-linear scaling parameter `gamma` (e.g., `w = val ** gamma` or `w = log_odds ** gamma`) with a range like [0.0, 5.0]. This will allow the model to smoothly interpolate between Tallying (gamma = 0), proportional WADD (gamma = 1), and TTB-like non-compensatory behavior (gamma > 1), enabling it to find the exact weighting scheme that resolves the tension between Experiment 1 (50% TTB match) and Experiment 2 (insensitivity to tally differences).

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5618 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3418 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The introduction of the `gamma` parameter successfully improved the model's fit, reducing the aggregate loss from 0.5618 to 0.3418. However, the model still misses the exact empirical targets. In Experiment 1, human TTB match is exactly at chance (0.5000), while the model predicts 0.6296. In Experiment 2, humans show no sensitivity to tally differences when evaluating the top-cue winner (-0.0237), whereas the model still shows a positive difference (0.2879). These values suggest that human behavior in these specific paradigms might be much noisier or closer to random guessing than the current parameter ranges allow.
Rationale: To allow the model to fully capture the chance-level TTB matching in Experiment 1 and the zero tally-difference effect in Experiment 2, expand the `epsilon` parameter range from [0.0, 0.5] to [0.0, 1.0]. This minor adjustment within the prescribed WADD family will allow the model to find the exact level of random guessing (potentially very high) needed to fit these specific null-like empirical effects, while keeping the gamma-scaled weighting mechanism intact for subjects who do use the cues.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3418 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.2387 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The expansion of the epsilon parameter range to [0.0, 1.0] successfully improved the model's fit, further reducing the aggregate loss from 0.3418 to 0.2387. The candidate is moving in the right direction: Experiment 1 predictions dropped from 0.6296 to 0.5817 (closer to the empirical 0.5000), and Experiment 2 predictions dropped from 0.2879 to 0.2033 (closer to the empirical -0.0237). However, the model still slightly over-predicts sensitivity to cues in both experiments. Since the empirical data points strongly toward chance-level behavior in these specific aggregate metrics, the model needs slightly more flexibility to reach a perfectly flat response profile.
Rationale: To help the model fully capture the chance-level behavior observed in the empirical data, expand the lower bound of the `beta` (inverse temperature) parameter from 0.1 to 0.0. This minor adjustment will allow the softmax function to natively produce perfectly flat (0.5/0.5) probabilities without forcing the model to rely exclusively on the `epsilon` lapse rate. Additionally, expand the upper bound of `gamma` from 5.0 to 10.0 to ensure that if any sub-population of subjects *does* use a strictly non-compensatory strategy, the model can capture them fully while using beta=0 or high epsilon for the rest.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.2387 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.2203 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The model's aggregate loss continues to decrease, indicating the parameter expansions (beta down to 0.0, gamma up to 10.0) were helpful. However, it still struggles to perfectly hit the empirical targets, and slightly regressed on Experiment 1 (increasing from 0.5817 to 0.6006, further from the 0.5000 target). A review of the candidate's code reveals a critical bug in the `use_log_odds` branch: `np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)` forces all cues to be treated as having validities > 0.5. If any experiment uses validities < 0.5, this clipping incorrectly reverses their meaning, treating worse-than-chance cues as positive evidence. Additionally, raising negative values (if validities were properly unclipped) to a fractional `gamma` would result in NaN or complex numbers.
Rationale: Regenerate to fix the cue weighting bug while staying within the prescribed WADD family. First, change the clipping to `np.clip(val, 0.0001, 0.9999)` so validities < 0.5 retain their proper meaning. Second, to safely apply `gamma` to potentially negative log-odds or negative centered validities, use signed exponentiation: `w = np.sign(base_w) * (np.abs(base_w) ** gamma)`. Third, when `use_log_odds == 0`, `base_w` should be centered (e.g., `val - 0.5`) so that a cue with 0.5 validity correctly receives 0 weight. Fixing this will allow the model to properly penalize or ignore negative/uninformative cues, likely closing the remaining gap in the metrics.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.2203 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
