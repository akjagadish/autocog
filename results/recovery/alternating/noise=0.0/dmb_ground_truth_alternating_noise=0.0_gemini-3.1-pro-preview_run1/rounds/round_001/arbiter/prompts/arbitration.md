# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_3") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_3
Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory: Decision-makers evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their features, where the weights directly correspond to the cue validities. The probability of choosing an option is then determined by the difference in these weighted sums via a softmax function, subject to decision noise. To capture empirical data where choices appear highly noisy or evenly balanced across experimental manipulations, the decision noise parameters (softmax inverse temperature and random lapse rate) can span the full range from deterministic choice to complete uniform guessing. In this iteration, the inverse temperature is constrained to very low values, enforcing highly stochastic behavior.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design strongly dissociates Take The Best (TTB) from the heavily stochastic Weighted Additive (WADD) model. In every trial, Option A is endorsed by the single most valid discriminating cue, meaning TTB will consistently and deterministically (due to its high allowed beta) choose Option A. Conversely, Option B is supported by a larger number of lower-validity cues such that its weighted sum is strictly greater than Option A's. The competing WADD theory is constrained to a very low inverse temperature (beta <= 0.5), meaning it predicts either a weak preference for Option B or near-random guessing, but it can never predict a systematic preference for Option A. Observing a strong preference for Option A will therefore uniquely support TTB.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
By design, Option A is always endorsed by the single most valid discriminating cue, while Option B is always supported by a larger number of lower-validity cues such that its weighted sum is strictly greater. Take The Best (TTB) will consistently choose Option A (response = 0). In contrast, Weighted Additive (WADD) will either choose Option B (response = 1) or guess randomly due to its constrained low inverse temperature. Therefore, the overall proportion of Option B choices (the mean of the 'response' column) will be near 0 for TTB and >= 0.5 for WADD, providing a massive and highly stable discriminant.

### RESULTS

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design aims to demonstrate that choices are driven by the weighted sum of all features (WADD) rather than a non-compensatory, one-reason rule (TTB), and that decision behavior is inherently noisy rather than deterministic. Across all trials, Option A is endorsed by the single most valid discriminating cue, meaning TTB will consistently predict Option A (and can do so with near certainty given its unconstrained beta). However, the number and validity of cues supporting Option B vary parametrically. In some trials, Option B's lower-validity cues sum to a much higher total than Option A's single cue, leading WADD to predict a preference for Option B. In other trials, Option A's weighted sum is higher. Because WADD is constrained to low beta values in this formulation, it predicts that choices will be highly stochastic but will linearly track the difference in weighted sums, occasionally flipping to favor Option B. If subjects show noisy choices that shift toward Option B when it has many lower-validity cues, it will strongly support WADD over TTB.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In all 5 trial types, the single most valid cue (Cue 1) strongly favors Option A. Because Take The Best (TTB) is a non-compensatory, one-reason decision rule, it will always stop searching at Cue 1 and deterministically predict Option A (subject only to response noise). Consequently, TTB predicts an overall very low proportion of Option B choices across the experiment. In contrast, Weighted Additive (WADD) theory is compensatory: it integrates all features. In 3 out of the 5 trial types, the combined weight of Option B's lower-validity cues exceeds the weight of Option A's single cue, meaning WADD predicts Option B will be chosen frequently. Because WADD's parameters in this experiment enforce high stochasticity, its predicted overall choice proportion for Option B hovers around 50%. The simple grand mean of Option B choices thus captures a massive baseline gap (~15% for TTB vs. ~50% for WADD) with very low per-subject variance, perfectly discriminating the two models.
