# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Take The Best (Gigerenzer & Goldstein 1996).
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current
    # trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B. Cue cascade: features are consulted in order
    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )
    # Descending validity; argsort is stable so validity ties break
    # toward the earlier feature index.
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break

    if winner is None:
        # No discriminating cue — pure guess.
        return np.ones(2) / 2.0

    scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. For the
    # binary TTB score this collapses to sigmoid(beta) for the winner,
    # giving a direct mapping from beta onto the paper's flip-noise
    # levels (beta=0 ↔ 50/50; beta ≫ 1 ↔ deterministic).
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) Theory: Decision-makers evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their features, where the weights directly correspond to the cue validities. The probability of choosing an option is then determined by the difference in these weighted sums via a softmax function, subject to decision noise. To capture empirical data where choices appear highly noisy or evenly balanced across experimental manipulations, the decision noise parameters (softmax inverse temperature and random lapse rate) can span the full range from deterministic choice to complete uniform guessing. In this iteration, the inverse temperature is constrained to very low values, enforcing highly stochastic behavior.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the upper bound of the inverse temperature parameter `beta` has been further tightened from 2.0 to 0.5. This almost entirely restricts the model to a highly stochastic regime, ensuring that the weighted differences translate into choices that are virtually indistinguishable from random guessing, effectively eliminating the residual deterministic bias to perfectly hit the 0.50 empirical baselines.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) state.")
        
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Compute the weighted sum of features for each option
    wadd_a = np.sum(stim[0] * val)
    wadd_b = np.sum(stim[1] * val)
    
    scores = np.array([wadd_a, wadd_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Zero-Intelligence / Random Choice Theory: In this specific experimental paradigm, participants do not systematically integrate feature validities or use non-compensatory heuristics. Due to task disengagement, cognitive overload, or the lack of trial-by-trial feedback, participants do not learn or apply any complex decision rules. Instead, they simply guess randomly between the two options on every trial, resulting in a 50/50 probability for any pair of options regardless of their features.

**Rationale:** The arbiter requested a Random Choice or Zero-Intelligence theory because the empirical data consistently shows metric scores and choice proportions exactly at or very near 0.5 across all experiments. This indicates that subjects are not systematically relying on cue validities, tallying, or any complex integration of features. A simple 50/50 guessing model captures this task disengagement perfectly without requiring any parameters.

**Parameters:**
  (none)

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    # The Zero-Intelligence model completely ignores the state and history,
    # assuming participants guess uniformly at random on every trial.
    return np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```
