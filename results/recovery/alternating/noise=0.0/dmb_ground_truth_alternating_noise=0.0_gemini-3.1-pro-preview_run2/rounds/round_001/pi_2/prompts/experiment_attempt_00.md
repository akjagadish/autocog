## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended heuristics (e.g. TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every heuristic agrees, and prefer pairs that dissociate single-feature focus from feature-summing strategies. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Decision makers evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their feature values, where the weights correspond to a non-linear scaling of the subjective or instructed validities of the cues. This non-linear Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy includes an exponent parameter (gamma) on the validities, allowing the decision process to smoothly interpolate between equal weighting (Tallying, gamma=0), proportional weighting (standard WADD, gamma=1), and lexicographic one-reason decision making (Take The Best, gamma > 1). The option with the higher total weighted score is favored, with response noise modeled via a softmax function over the scores and an independent lapse rate. To capture the fact that human behavior can sometimes be entirely random, the lapse rate and inverse temperature parameters are allowed to span their full theoretical ranges (up to pure guessing).

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.0, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 1.0]
- gamma: [0.0, 5.0]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current trial:
    # array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    # Validities are used as weights for the additive sum.
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != stim.shape[1]:
        raise ValueError("Length of validities must match n_features.")
        
    # Apply non-linear scaling to validities
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    val = val ** gamma
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Compute the weighted sum (WADD score) for each option.
    score_a = np.dot(a, val)
    score_b = np.dot(b, val)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] This design dissociates Take The Best (TTB) from Tallying by creating direct conflicts between the single most valid discriminating cue and the total count of winning features. In several trials, one option wins on the highest validity cue (which determines the TTB choice) while the other option wins on a larger number of lower-validity cues (which determines the Tallying choice). Additionally, cases where Tallying predicts a tie (equal number of winning features) but TTB makes a deterministic prediction based on validity order are included.

[1] This design robustly dissociates Tallying from Take The Best (TTB) by pitting the single most valid discriminating cue against the sheer count of winning features. The validities are strictly ordered (0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65). In many trials, one option possesses the highest-validity discriminating feature (and thus wins under TTB), while the opposing option wins on a larger number of lower-validity features (and thus wins under Tallying). Additionally, we include trials where the total feature-wise wins are perfectly tied (causing Tallying to guess uniformly at random), yet TTB makes a deterministic prediction because one option has a higher value on the top discriminating cue.

[2] To quantitatively dissociate Non-linear WADD from Tallying, we must decouple the sheer count of winning features from the cumulative validity of those features. Tallying strictly predicts choices based on the number of feature-wise wins, collapsing to random guessing (50/50) whenever the number of winning features is equal. In contrast, Non-linear WADD integrates the validities of the winning features, scaled by a non-linear parameter (gamma). This design includes trials where Tallying predicts a tie but WADD predicts a strong preference based on validity (e.g., winning on 2 high-validity vs 2 low-validity features). It also includes trials where Tallying favors one option (more wins) but WADD favors the other (fewer wins, but on features with much higher validities), allowing us to estimate the gamma parameter and show that subjects are sensitive to validity magnitudes rather than just counts.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — heuristics that rely on validity-ordering re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) collapse WADD into a scaled Equal-Weight rule and make them indistinguishable by any decision.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended heuristics (TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) be dissociated; avoid trials where every heuristic agrees.


## Response

```json
{
  "rationale": "This design strictly dissociates Tallying from Non-linear WADD by systematically varying the count of winning features independently of their validities. Tallying relies solely on the number of strict feature-wise wins, predicting a uniform 50/50 guess whenever the number of wins is tied, and a robust preference whenever one option has more wins, completely ignoring validity magnitudes. WADD, by contrast, weights wins by their validities (scaled by gamma). The trial set includes 'Tallying Ties' where options win on an equal number of features but differ in validity (WADD strongly prefers the high-validity option), and 'Reversal' trials where one option wins on more features (favored by Tallying) but the other wins on fewer, higher-validity features (favored by WADD).",
