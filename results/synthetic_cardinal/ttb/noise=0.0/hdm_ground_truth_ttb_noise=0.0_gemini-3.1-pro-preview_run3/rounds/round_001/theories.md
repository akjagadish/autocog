# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_model` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Human decision-making in multi-attribute choice is not governed by a single universal heuristic. Instead, individuals differ in their strategies or switch between them, such that the population's choices reflect a mixture of Tallying (which counts strict feature-wise wins and ignores magnitudes and validities) and Weighted Additive (WADD, which integrates both magnitudes and validities). A mixture weight parameter 'alpha' dictates the probability of using Tallying versus WADD on any given trial. Response noise enters through a softmax over the scores of the chosen heuristic, plus an independent lapse rate.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory implements a Mixture of Heuristics model. The previous models (Tallying and WADD) each systematically failed on certain experiments where the other succeeded, suggesting that human behavior relies on a combination of both strategies across the population. By introducing the 'alpha' parameter, the model can probabilistically mix Tallying (which ignores magnitudes and validities) and WADD (which accounts for both), allowing it to capture the heterogeneous choice patterns observed in the data.

**Parameters:**
  - `alpha`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
import numpy as np

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) state; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    
    # Tallying heuristic
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    tally_scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    z_tally = beta * (tally_scores - tally_scores.max())
    e_tally = np.exp(z_tally)
    p_tally = e_tally / e_tally.sum()
    
    # WADD heuristic
    w = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    wadd_scores = stim @ w
    z_wadd = beta * (wadd_scores - wadd_scores.max())
    e_wadd = np.exp(z_wadd)
    p_wadd = e_wadd / e_wadd.sum()
    
    # Mixture of heuristics
    alpha = float(parameters["alpha"])
    p_mixed = alpha * p_tally + (1.0 - alpha) * p_wadd
    
    # Lapse rate
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    p_final = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_mixed + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    
    return p_final
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
import numpy as np

def policy(probs):
    p = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    p /= p.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(p), p=p))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    w = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ w

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    return int(np.argmax(probabilities))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_3_1` → slot 1 (via `new_model`)

**Description:** Human decision-making in multi-attribute choice is not governed by a single universal heuristic. Instead, individuals differ in their strategies or switch between them, such that the population's choices reflect a mixture of Tallying (which counts strict feature-wise wins and ignores magnitudes and validities) and Weighted Additive (WADD, which integrates both magnitudes and validities). A mixture weight parameter 'alpha' dictates the probability of using Tallying versus WADD on any given trial. Response noise enters through a softmax over the scores of the chosen heuristic, plus an independent lapse rate.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, the `policy` function has been modified to be strictly deterministic, returning the argmax of the computed probabilities instead of sampling from them. This change directly addresses the failure to capture the zero within-subject variance observed in Experiment 4. Because the argmax operation ignores uniform noise, the `epsilon` lapse rate parameter was removed from both the `parameters` dictionary and the `predict` function. The population-level choice probabilities will now correctly emerge from the between-subject distributions of the model parameters (`alpha`, `beta`, `validities`) rather than trial-by-trial sampling noise.

**Parameters:**
  - `alpha`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `validities`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
import numpy as np

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) state; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    
    # Tallying heuristic
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    tally_scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    z_tally = beta * (tally_scores - tally_scores.max())
    e_tally = np.exp(z_tally)
    p_tally = e_tally / e_tally.sum()
    
    # WADD heuristic
    w = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    wadd_scores = stim @ w
    z_wadd = beta * (wadd_scores - wadd_scores.max())
    e_wadd = np.exp(z_wadd)
    p_wadd = e_wadd / e_wadd.sum()
    
    # Mixture of heuristics
    alpha = float(parameters["alpha"])
    p_mixed = alpha * p_tally + (1.0 - alpha) * p_wadd
    
    return p_mixed
