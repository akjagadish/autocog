# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Heuristic Decision Making domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of integer expert ratings in [0, rating_max]. Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length), per-expert validities, and `rating_max`; all three are LLM-proposed. Choosing rating_max=1 gives binary ratings; rating_max>1 gives cardinal ratings whose magnitudes carry information beyond just sign. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Propose a brand-new theory that incorporates a different mechanism, such as Take-The-Best (TTB) or Weighted Additive (WADD). For example, TTB would search through cues in descending order of validity and stop at the first cue that discriminates between the options, ignoring all other cues. Alternatively, WADD would multiply the cardinal feature values by their validities and sum them, accounting for both magnitude and importance. Either would provide a stronger competitor to Weighted Tallying than the current unweighted Tallying model.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic: Decision-makers evaluate options by searching through features in descending order of their subjective validity. The search stops at the first feature that discriminates between the options (i.e., where one option has a strictly higher value than the other), and the option favored by this feature is chosen. All remaining features are entirely ignored. If no features discriminate, the decision-maker guesses randomly. This represents a fast-and-frugal, non-compensatory strategy where a single highly valid cue can dominate the decision regardless of how many lower-validity cues point the other way.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    v = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(v)[::-1]
    
    score_a = 0.0
    score_b = 0.0
    
    # Search for the first discriminating cue
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            score_a = 1.0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            score_b = 1.0
            break
            
    # If no cues discriminate, they tie
    if score_a == 0.0 and score_b == 0.0:
        score_a = 0.5
        score_b = 0.5
        
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse rate
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    p_final = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
    
    return p_final


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory implements the Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. Unlike Tallying, which equally weights all features and counts wins, TTB incorporates the validity of each feature by ordering them from most to least valid. It then relies on a non-compensatory stopping rule: the first feature that discriminates between the two options dictates the choice, completely ignoring any subsequent features. This effectively captures human heuristic decision-making where individuals rely on a single, highly informative piece of evidence rather than integrating all available information, providing a stark contrast to compensatory models like WADD or equally-weighted models like Tallying.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4081 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4081.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Take-The-Best (TTB) model strongly deviates from human behavior, particularly in Experiment 2. In Exp 2, Option B dominates on the most valid feature (10 vs 0), while Option A wins on the three remaining features (4 vs 0). TTB deterministically chooses B (simulated response = 0.84), but human subjects actually prefer A (real response = 0.26). This indicates that human decision-making in this paradigm is not strictly non-compensatory; subjects are integrating across multiple features, and the sheer number of winning features for A overrides the magnitude advantage B has on the single best feature.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "TTB's strict non-compensatory stopping rule fails because it completely ignores the accumulation of evidence from lower-validity cues. Since the arbiter explicitly offered Weighted Additive (WADD) as an alternative within the prescribed family, you should switch to WADD. However, note that a standard linear WADD also predicts a preference for B in Exp 2 (9.0 > 7.6). To capture the human preference for A, implement WADD with a diminishing returns (non-linear) transformation on the feature values (e.g., applying a square root or logarithmic scaling to the cardinal ratings before multiplying by validities). This will compress the large '10' rating, allowing the three smaller wins for A to cumulatively outweigh B's single large win."
