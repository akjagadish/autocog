# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Heuristic Decision Making domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 50). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of integer expert ratings in [0, rating_max]. Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length), per-expert validities, and `rating_max`; all three are LLM-proposed. Choosing rating_max=1 gives binary ratings; rating_max>1 gives cardinal ratings whose magnitudes carry information beyond just sign. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings in [0, rating_max]. The per-feature validities, n_features, and rating_max are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. All three — `n_features`, `validities`, and `rating_max` — are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]

**rating_max:** 10

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[2, 5, 5, 5]  B=[10, 4, 4, 4]
  trial 2: A=[6, 6, 6, 6]  B=[5, 5, 5, 10]
  trial 3: A=[10, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 2, 2, 2]
  trial 4: A=[8, 8, 0, 0]  B=[7, 7, 2, 2]

**Rationale:** This design contrasts the Mixture model (Tallying + Weighted Tallying), which is sign-based and ignores magnitude differences, with the WADD model, which integrates both feature magnitudes and validities. By using a rating_max of 10, we can create large magnitude differences on single features that dominate the WADD score but count as only a single 'win' or 'loss' for the Mixture model. Trial 1 creates a scenario where the Mixture model prefers A (wins on 3 features) but WADD prefers B (huge magnitude advantage on the most valid feature). Trial 2 forces a tie in WADD while the Mixture model strongly prefers A. Trial 3 reverses Trial 1, with WADD preferring A and Mixture preferring B. Trial 4 pits the validity sum (favored by Mixture) against the total weighted magnitude (favored by WADD).

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Mixture of Tallying and Weighted Tallying: Decision makers do not universally ignore explicit validities (as in pure Tallying) nor do they perfectly weight every feature by its numerical validity (as in pure Weighted Tallying). Instead, the population consists of a mixture of strategies, or individuals use a blended strategy. Some individuals rely on a simple count of winning features (Tallying), while others incorporate the provided validities to weight those wins. By modeling choice as a convex combination of the Tallying score and the Weighted Tallying score, the model can capture intermediate levels of consensus and account for why human behavior often falls between the predictions of these two pure heuristics.

**Parameters:**
- w_tally: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be (2, n_features)")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Tallying scores: simple count of strictly winning features
    tally_a = np.sum(a > b)
    tally_b = np.sum(b > a)
    
    # Weighted Tallying scores: sum of validities for winning features
    wt_a = np.sum(validities[a > b])
    wt_b = np.sum(validities[b > a])
    
    # Blend the two strategies
    w = float(parameters["w_tally"])
    score_a = w * tally_a + (1.0 - w) * wt_a
    score_b = w * tally_b + (1.0 - w) * wt_b
            
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the blended scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) Model: Decision-makers evaluate options by multiplying the full cardinal rating of each feature by its explicitly provided expert validity, and then summing these products to form an overall expected value for each option. Unlike tallying heuristics that binarize feature differences into strict wins and losses, WADD integrates both the magnitude of the feature ratings and the explicit cue weights. This compensatory strategy allows a large advantage on a lower-validity feature to outweigh a small deficit on a higher-validity feature. Choices are made probabilistically via a softmax over the integrated values, combined with a uniform lapse rate.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be (2, n_features)")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Use the explicitly provided expert validities from the experiment
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # WADD score: sum of (cardinal rating * explicit validity)
    score_a = np.sum(a * validities)
    score_b = np.sum(b * validities)
            
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the integrated scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features integer expert ratings (each in [0, rating_max]) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features integer expert ratings (each in [0, rating_max]) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "The metric computes the difference in the probability of choosing option A between Trial 1 (where option A has an initial rating of 2) and Trial 3 (where option A has an initial rating of 10). The Mixture model, which relies on tallying wins, strongly prefers A in Trial 1 and B in Trial 3. In contrast, the WADD model, which integrates feature magnitudes, strongly prefers B in Trial 1 and A in Trial 3. This creates a large positive value for the Mixture model and a large negative value for the WADD model, making it highly discriminative."
