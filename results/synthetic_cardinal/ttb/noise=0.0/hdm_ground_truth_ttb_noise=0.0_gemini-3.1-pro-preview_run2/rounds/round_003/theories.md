# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Mixture of Tallying and Weighted Tallying: Decision makers do not universally ignore explicit validities (as in pure Tallying) nor do they perfectly weight every feature by its numerical validity (as in pure Weighted Tallying). Instead, the population consists of a mixture of strategies, or individuals use a blended strategy. Some individuals rely on a simple count of winning features (Tallying), while others incorporate the provided validities to weight those wins. By modeling choice as a convex combination of the Tallying score and the Weighted Tallying score, the model can capture intermediate levels of consensus and account for why human behavior often falls between the predictions of these two pure heuristics.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory models a mixture between pure Tallying and Weighted Tallying. Tallying completely ignores validities, resulting in overly extreme predictions on experiments where subjects do use validity information (e.g., Exp 6). Conversely, Weighted Tallying relies exclusively on numerical validities, which can underestimate the human tendency to simply count winning features. By introducing a subject-specific blending parameter `w_tally`, the model effectively forms a population-level mixture that smoothly interpolates between these two heuristics. This hybrid score mechanism should yield intermediate consensus levels, bringing predictions much closer to the observed human behavior across the experimental suite.

**Parameters:**
  - `w_tally`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be (2, n_features)")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Tallying scores: simple count of strictly winning features
    tally_a = np.sum(a > b)
    tally_b = np.sum(b > a)
    
    # Weighted Tallying scores: sum of validities for winning features
    wt_a = np.sum(validities[a > b])
    wt_b = np.sum(validities[b > a])
    
    # Blend the two strategies
    w = float(parameters["w_tally"])
    score_a = w * tally_a + (1.0 - w) * wt_a
    score_b = w * tally_b + (1.0 - w) * wt_b
            
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the blended scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Weighted Tallying Heuristic: People make decisions by integrating across multiple features, but rather than treating all cues equally (as in simple Tallying), they weight each feature-wise win by the explicitly provided expert validity. The score for each option is the sum of the validities for the features where that option has a strictly higher rating than the other. The option with the highest validity-weighted tally is chosen. This captures both the tendency to integrate across features and the sensitivity to explicit validities.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, we replace Take-The-Best with Weighted Tallying. TTB under-predicted the strong tallying behavior seen in Experiments 1 and 3 because it stopped at the first discriminating feature. Weighted Tallying resolves this by integrating across all features (explaining the tallying-like behavior) while still weighting the feature-wise wins by the explicitly provided expert validities, honoring the arbiter's original instruction to incorporate validities into the heuristic without falling back to a fully compensatory magnitude-based model like WADD.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Weighted Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sum validities for features where an option strictly wins
    score_a = np.sum(validities[a > b])
    score_b = np.sum(validities[b > a])
            
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) Model: Decision-makers evaluate options by multiplying the full cardinal rating of each feature by its explicitly provided expert validity, and then summing these products to form an overall expected value for each option. Unlike tallying heuristics that binarize feature differences into strict wins and losses, WADD integrates both the magnitude of the feature ratings and the explicit cue weights. This compensatory strategy allows a large advantage on a lower-validity feature to outweigh a small deficit on a higher-validity feature. Choices are made probabilistically via a softmax over the integrated values, combined with a uniform lapse rate.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's recommendation, this theory instantiates the Weighted Additive (WADD) model. A previous attempt at WADD (`pi_2`) failed because it treated validities as free parameters to be fitted per-subject (`[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`), completely ignoring the explicit expert validities provided in the experiment. By correctly anchoring the weights to the explicit validities (`validities: validities`), this model accurately captures how decision-makers integrate cardinal feature magnitudes with explicit cue weights, providing a robust compensatory benchmark that accounts for magnitude-driven trade-offs.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be (2, n_features)")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Use the explicitly provided expert validities from the experiment
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # WADD score: sum of (cardinal rating * explicit validity)
    score_a = np.sum(a * validities)
    score_b = np.sum(b * validities)
            
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the integrated scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
