# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Heuristic Decision Making domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of integer expert ratings in [0, rating_max]. Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length), per-expert validities, and `rating_max`; all three are LLM-proposed. Choosing rating_max=1 gives binary ratings; rating_max>1 gives cardinal ratings whose magnitudes carry information beyond just sign. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Propose a 'Strategy Selection' or 'Hybrid' theory to replace Tallying. This new theory should posit that decision-makers rely on a mixture of heuristics depending on the cognitive load or individual differences (e.g., a mixture model where a parameter 'p_wadd' dictates the probability of using a compensatory WADD strategy versus a non-compensatory Tallying strategy on any given trial). Alternatively, propose a 'Threshold' model where subjects default to Tallying unless the cardinal difference on a high-validity feature exceeds a certain threshold, at which point they switch to a compensatory evaluation.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Dynamic Strategy Selection (Threshold Model): Decision-makers dynamically select between a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy and a non-compensatory Tallying strategy on a trial-by-trial basis. The choice of strategy depends on the maximum cardinal difference between the options across all features. If this difference exceeds a certain threshold, the decision-maker is more likely to use WADD to account for the large magnitude; otherwise, they default to the simpler Tallying heuristic. This is modeled as a probabilistic mixture where the weight of WADD is a soft step function (sigmoid) of the maximum feature difference.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- threshold: [0.0, 10.0]
- steepness: [0.1, 10.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, the fixed probabilistic mixture is replaced with a dynamic, stimulus-driven threshold mechanism. The model computes the maximum cardinal difference between options on any feature. A soft threshold (sigmoid) determines the mixture probability `w_wadd` for that trial based on this max difference. This allows the model to correctly favor Tallying when differences are small (like in Experiment 2) and switch to WADD when there are extreme cardinal differences (like in Experiment 3), addressing the specific failure modes of the previous fixed-mixture theory.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1748 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1259 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1259.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory implements a fixed probabilistic mixture of WADD and Tallying, which successfully reduces the aggregate loss and was accepted by the gate. However, looking at the experiment-level fits, it fails to capture the dynamic nature of strategy selection. In Experiment 3, which features extreme cardinal differences (e.g., 10 vs 0), humans choose the WADD-consistent option 64.46% of the time, but the model only predicts 45.50%. Conversely, in Experiment 2, where differences are smaller, humans use Tallying 72.70% of the time, but the model overpredicts it at 85.10%. A fixed `w_wadd` parameter cannot adapt to these stimulus-driven changes in strategy.
Rationale: The current fixed-mixture approach should be revised to a dynamic 'Threshold' model, as originally suggested in the arbiter's prompt. Instead of a fixed `w_wadd` probability, introduce a `threshold` parameter. On each trial, compute the maximum cardinal difference between the two options across all features. If this maximum difference exceeds the `threshold`, evaluate the options using WADD; otherwise, default to Tallying. You can implement this as a soft threshold (e.g., using a sigmoid function over the max difference to determine `w_wadd` for that trial) or a hard switch. This will allow the model to correctly predict high Tallying in Exp 2 (small differences) and high WADD in Exp 3 (large differences), improving cross-experiment fit.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1748 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1259 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate theory successfully implemented the dynamic threshold mechanism based on cardinal differences, which led to a substantial improvement in aggregate loss (from 0.1748 to 0.1259). By making the mixture of WADD and Tallying stimulus-dependent, the model effectively captures the shift towards compensatory strategies when extreme differences are present. In Experiment 3, the WADD consistency score rose from 0.4550 to 0.7023, closely matching the empirical value of 0.6446. Experiment 2's Tallying match remains high at 0.8521, capturing the baseline preference for non-compensatory heuristics when differences are small. While Experiment 1's fit is still lower than the empirical data, this is largely because the prescribed mechanism family (WADD vs. Tallying) lacks a Take-The-Best component, which is the primary driver of Experiment 1's metric. Within the prescribed family, this threshold implementation is highly effective.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The dynamic strategy selection model perfectly executes the arbiter's recommendation for a threshold-based mixture. The transition from a fixed to a stimulus-driven mixture probability successfully resolved the failure modes in Experiment 3 without compromising the Tallying baseline in Experiment 2. The aggregate loss has improved significantly, and the model represents a strong, experiment-invariant baseline for this mechanism family. No further revisions are needed at this level."
