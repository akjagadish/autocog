# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Propose a brand-new theory to replace pi_2. The new theory should be a capacity-sensitive, order-weighted evidence accumulation account. People scan features left-to-right and accumulate a preference score: each discriminating feature j contributes a signed increment weighted by display position and stated validity. Early positions receive stronger weight, producing take-the-best-like choices for short feature lists, while the position gradient flattens as feature count exceeds working-memory capacity, producing tallying-like behavior for eight-feature problems. Choice probability comes from a softmax over the accumulated score plus a lapse probability. This would explain Experiment 1 as partial, not absolute, first-cue dominance; Experiments 3 and 4 as display-order directional choices on tally ties; and Experiment 2 as near-chance responding when the long feature list flattens the weights and the sign counts balance. Avoid a hard lexicographic stop and avoid equal weighting across all cues; instead estimate a continuous weight function that depends on feature count, display position, and stated validity.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People scan the displayed features from left to right and accumulate a signed preference signal, without ever committing to a hard lexicographic stop. Each discriminating feature contributes an increment whose weight is a continuous function of serial position, stated validity, and list length. For short lists the position weight is a steep exponential primacy gradient, so the first discriminator dominates probabilistically rather than absolutely. As list length exceeds working-memory capacity the gradient collapses toward a flat weighting function, making the rule behave like a tallying heuristic on long lists. The accumulated score is passed through a softmax with inverse temperature beta, and an independent lapse probability permits occasional intention-independent errors.

- beta: [4.51, 4.53]
- epsilon: [0.095, 0.105]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
The model replaces pi_2's equal-weight tallying with a capacity-sensitive order-weighted accumulator. On five-feature problems the exponential position gradient is sharp, so the first displayed discriminator exerts partial rather than absolute control: this produces the reversed high-validity-cue effect in Experiment 1, the negative validity-order first-cue effect in Experiment 2, and the intermediate first-displayed-cue agreement in Experiment 3. Because there is no hard stop, later cues still leak into the score, which is why Experiment 3 agreement is around 0.62 rather than the near-ceiling value produced by the hard display-order rule pi_3. On eight-feature problems the capacity-sensitive factor flattens both the position gradient and validity modulation, so tally ties have nearly canceling evidence and choice is near chance, matching the near-zero directional effect in Experiment 4 far better than pi_3's strict first-cue rule.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0424 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0424.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate reproduces the main empirical patterns across the four experiments. In Experiment 1 it yields -0.4217 against the observed -0.4400, correctly capturing the reversed effect of the high-validity cue rather than an absolute first-cue rule. In Experiment 2 it yields -0.3717 against -0.3750, closely matching the negative validity-order first-cue effect. In Experiment 3 it yields 0.6158 against 0.6246, which is exactly the expected partial rather than absolute display-order agreement. The only notable gap is Experiment 4: the candidate produces -0.0027 while the observed value is -0.1173. This suggests the strong capacity flattening removes essentially all residual display-order directionality on eight-feature tally ties, whereas the real data retain a small negative residual. However the real effect is modest, and the candidate correctly avoids the large positive directional effect produced by pi_3 at 0.7160.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The theory faithfully implements the prescribed capacity-sensitive, order-weighted evidence accumulation family: exponential primacy for short lists, flattening when feature count exceeds working-memory capacity, softmax choice over the accumulated score, a lapse probability, and no hard lexicographic stop. It matches Experiments 1, 2, and 3 quantitatively and Experiment 4 qualitatively as near-chance responding on long-list tally ties. The remaining Experiment 4 discrepancy is small relative to the metric's between-subject spread, and further tuning risks overfitting what may be a weak residual pattern. Keep the current candidate."
