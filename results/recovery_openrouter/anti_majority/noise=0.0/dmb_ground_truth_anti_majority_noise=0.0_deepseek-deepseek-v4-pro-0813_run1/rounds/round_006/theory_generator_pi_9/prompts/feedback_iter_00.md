# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_8`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Propose a new theory, e.g. 'tied-prefix reset with length-gated configural contrast'. It should retain pi_8's early-span primacy, same-sign run gain, short-list odd-one-out bonus, tie-gap penalty, compressive validity gain, tail/recency accumulation, and subject heterogeneity. It must add/modify: (1) a pre-cue tie-run reset — if the first discriminating cue is preceded by >=2 tied positions, its weight is strongly reduced or sign-flipped subject-wise, and the last discriminating cue/tail block dominates, producing leftmost-cue adherence near 0.18 in Exp2; (2) strict length gating of the odd-one-out bonus so it is essentially zero for n>=8, eliminating the Exp1 adjacent-arrangement contrast (target ~0.02); (3) subject-level anti-cue weights on long lists to preserve near-zero means with large between-subject variance in Exp6/8; (4) retain the tie-gap penalty after the first cue to keep the Exp13/14 mirror asymmetry. Parameter ranges should be set so the new theory can produce Exp2 ~0.18, Exp1 ~0.0, Exp11 ~0.20, Exp12 ~1.87, Exp13 ~-0.19, and Exp14 ~0.70, without creating a recency effect for single cues (Exp7 ~-0.02).

`rationale`:
This theory keeps pi_8's core early-span primacy, same-sign run gain, tie-gap penalty, compressive validity gain, and tail/recency accumulation, but adds the three prescribed repairs. First, a pre-cue tie-run reset detects a first discriminating cue preceded by at least two tied positions and, when the cue's stated validity is low, replaces its evidence weight with a strongly negative subject-level value instead of the usual tail weight, so late first cues are actively counter-sampled and leftmost-cue adherence drops toward 0.18 in Experiment 14 without damaging single-cue experiments whose early/high-validity cues escape the reset. Second, the configural odd-one-out bonus is now strictly length-gated around n=6 with a narrow temperature and the separate long-list configural bonus is removed entirely, so the adjacent-versus-nonadjacent block contrast in n=10 (Experiment 13) collapses to near zero while short-list configural effects remain. Third, on long lists (n>=9) the early-position weights are multiplied by a subject-level polarity factor that can be negative for many subjects, producing near-zero group means with large between-subject variance in Experiments 6 and 8. The tie-gap penalty is strengthened to deepen the Experiment 11 near/all asymmetry, and the anti-cue reset plus strict gating together avoid the recency contamination of single-cue trials.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1456 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1456.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is a faithful instantiation of the prescribed mechanism family and it preserves many of pi_8's good fits: Exp1 (-0.483 vs -0.440), Exp2 (-0.340 vs -0.375), Exp3 (0.633 vs 0.625), Exp5 (-0.049 vs -0.022), Exp7 (0.118 vs 0.110), Exp8 mean (0.377 vs 0.348), Exp10 (1.934 vs 1.874), and Exp11 direction (-0.228 vs -0.187) are all broadly reasonable. However, the candidate fails on the very repairs it was designed to implement. Exp14's leftmost-cue adherence is 0.582 against the observed 0.177, meaning the pre-cue tie-run reset is effectively not triggering: in Exp14 every first discriminating cue is preceded by three tied positions, so the reset's additional low-stated-validity gate is the likely blocker. Exp13's adjacent-vs-nonadjacent contrast is 0.299 against the observed 0.023; the strict length gate on the odd-one-out bonus alone was insufficient because the tail/recency accumulation still differs between adjacent and nonadjacent later-cue blocks on long lists. Exp6 is wrong in both mean and heterogeneity (0.198 with var 0.024 vs -0.063 with var 0.197), showing the long-list polarity distribution is miscalibrated: its range [-0.40, 1.40] has a strongly positive mean, so subject-level anti-cue weights do not produce the required near-zero group mean with large between-subject variance. Exp8 has the right mean but almost no between-subject variance (0.005 vs 0.043), so the subject-heterogeneity mechanism is absent or too weak at n=7. Exp9 is too flat (0.121 vs 0.203) and Exp12's mirror asymmetry remains too weak (0.603 vs 0.699). Exp4 is also essentially zero (-0.011 vs -0.117).",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the overall pi_8-derived architecture and the prescribed repairs, but recalibrate the triggering and distributional knobs. (1) Remove or greatly relax the low-validity gate on the pre-cue tie-run reset; the reset should depend primarily on tie_run_len >= 2. If single-cue experiments need protection, require either multiple discriminators or a high tie-run length, rather than gating on stated validity, and make tie_run_flipped_weight strongly negative subject-wise so the tail block dominates in Exp14. (2) Add a long-list configural tail/recency suppression: when n>=8 and the first discriminating cue is at position 0 with all later cues opposing it, scale tail evidence down toward 0.0-0.25. This removes the residual adjacent/nonadjacent contrast in Exp13 without eliminating short-list configural effects or damaging Exp10, whose arrangement is not a pure configural-odd long list in the same way. (3) Recalibrate long_early_polarity to a zero-mean symmetric broad distribution, e.g. roughly [-2.0, 2.0] or a discrete sign distribution around 0, instead of the positively biased [-0.40, 1.40]; this should fix the Exp6 mean and variance. Extend the subject-heterogeneity mechanism to cover Exp8 (n=7), for example by lowering long_list_threshold to 7-8 or widening subject_scale to about [0.30, 2.30], so Exp8's between-subject variance approaches the observed 0.043. (4) Slightly increase tail/recency weight to recover the Exp9 opposing-cue slope toward 0.20, with the long-list configural tail suppression in place to prevent a new Exp13 contrast. (5) For Exp12, modestly sharpen early cue dominance (slightly higher early_weight or lower trial_noise_sd), while moving tie_gap_penalty away from the current extreme (toward roughly [0.35, 0.55]) so Exp11 does not overshoot beyond the observed -0.187. These are in-family parameter and gating recalibrations, not a change of mechanism family."
