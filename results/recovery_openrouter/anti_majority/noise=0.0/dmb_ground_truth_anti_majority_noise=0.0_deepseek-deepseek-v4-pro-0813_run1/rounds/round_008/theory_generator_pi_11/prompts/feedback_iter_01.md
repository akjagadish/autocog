# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_9`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_10`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_9`).

Replace pi_9 with a 'run-gated ordered evidence accumulation' theory. The core idea is that the first discriminating cue's weight is not a fixed early-block polarity, but a credibility signal that depends on the local cue-run structure, list length, and recent delayed-cue context. The new theory should include: (1) a strong tie-gap penalty applied to the first cue whenever the immediately following position is tied, strong enough that a single opposing later cue can reverse the choice, explaining Experiment 2; (2) a length-band early polarity: positive on short lists except when tie-gap suppressed, negative at n=8, a subject-level mixture of zero and moderate positive at n=7, and position-1 discounting on n>=9 outside two-cue configural displays; (3) a context-graded negative weight for delayed first discriminating cues, strengthened by recent delayed-first-cue trials, explaining Experiments 8, 16, and 18; (4) a configural odd-one-out bonus on short lists that is gated off by n=6/8, with density/count decay and tie-gap interaction, explaining Experiments 5, 13, 14, and 17; (5) long-list configural suppression and equalization of adjacent versus nonadjacent later cues in two-cue configural displays, explaining Experiments 11 and 15; (6) validity as a compressive attentional gain plus a validity-order/tie-gap gate that releases the tie-gap penalty only when the opposing late cue has validity at least as high as the first cue; (7) subject-level mirror asymmetry and noisy softmax with lapse. This differs from pi_9 by adopting negative n=8 early polarity, a general tie-gap penalty, and delayed-first-cue anti-weighting; it differs from pi_10 by making the tie-gap penalty strong enough to produce negative first-cue following in Experiment 2, moderating the n=7 early branch to avoid overpredicting Experiment 10, and reducing the n=10 high-cue effect to match Experiment 12.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People make binary quality choices through run-gated ordered evidence accumulation. The first discriminating cue's credibility weight is length-band specific, with negative early polarity on long lists, and is additionally gated by local cue-run structure: a strong tie-gap penalty is applied when a single opposing late cue follows the first cue, but the penalty is relaxed when multiple later opposing cues follow. The tie-gap penalty can be released only when the opposing late cue is inside the early span and has validity at least as high as the first cue. Delayed first discriminating cues receive a context-graded negative weight that is strengthened by recent delayed-first-cue trials. A configural odd-one-out bonus on short lists interacts with tie gaps and decays with density/count, while long two-cue configural displays have suppressed early cues and partially preserved tail opposition to equalize adjacent and nonadjacent later-cue displays. Validity enters as a compressive attentional gain, and choices arise from a noisy softmax with subject-level scale, bias, trial noise, lapse, and mirror asymmetry.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal calibration edit of the accepted run-gated ordered evidence accumulator. The main change makes the tie-gap penalty depend on the local late-cue structure: a single opposing late cue after a tie gap receives an extra penalty multiplier, addressing the weak anti-following in Experiment 18, while multiple later opposing cues relax the same penalty, reducing the over-negative Experiment 11 effect. The validity-order release gate is now limited to single opposing cues inside the early span, and the released opposing cue is strengthened rather than nearly deleted. Long-list early polarity now becomes negative for n>=12 to fix the Experiment 6 sign, while n=8 negative polarity is reduced in magnitude. The n=10 high-cue discount is strengthened, long two-cue tail suppression is stronger to equalize adjacent and nonadjacent configurations, delayed-first-cue anti-weight is reduced, n=7 positive polarity is slightly increased, and mirror asymmetry is widened. All changes remain within the prescribed mechanism family.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0949 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1081 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0949.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is broadly in the right mechanism family and gets many targets close: Experiments 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 are well matched, and it improves on several pi_9/pi_10 failures. However, the fit is not yet good enough to ship. The aggregate loss of 0.0949 masks a set of systematic, directional misses. (1) Experiment 6 has a sign error: real -0.0633 vs candidate +0.0283. The long-list position-1 first-cue discount is too weak at n=12; the first discriminating cue at position 1 should produce slight anti-following, not following. (2) Experiment 18 is far too weak: real -0.2567 vs candidate -0.0619. The strong tie-gap penalty is not strong enough for the single-opposing-late-cue-after-tie-gap configuration, or the validity-order release gate is miscalibrated. (3) Experiment 11 is too negative: real -0.1867 vs candidate -0.3275. The same tie-gap penalty is too strong when multiple later cues oppose the first cue in a short near-configural display, indicating the penalty needs to be modulated by the number/structure of later opposing cues rather than applied as a constant multiplier. (4) Experiment 10 overpredicts the high-cue effect: real 1.8744 vs candidate 2.4289, despite the n10_high_cue_discount parameter; that discount is too weak. (5) Experiments 14 and 16 are both under-following delayed first cues: real 0.1771 vs candidate 0.1062 and real 0.1383 vs candidate 0.0689. The delayed-first-cue anti-weight is too strong. (6) Experiments 4 and 17 are over-negative: real -0.1173 vs candidate -0.1773 and real -0.7433 vs candidate -0.8683, suggesting the n=8 negative early polarity is too large in magnitude. (7) Experiment 13 overpredicts the adjacent-vs-nonadjacent difference: real 0.0231 vs candidate 0.0872, so the long two-cue configural equalization is not strong enough. (8) Experiment 8 is moderately over-positive on conflict tally agreement: real 0.3475 vs candidate 0.4179. There is also an implementation smell: `late_anti_unconditional_threshold` is declared but never used, and `short_single_opposing_ratio` is near zero (0.0-0.06), which means the validity-order release gate, when triggered, nearly eliminates the released opposing late cue instead of letting it compete. These are all in-family calibration issues rather than evidence against the run-gated ordered evidence accumulation mechanism.
Rationale: Keep the prescribed run-gated ordered evidence accumulation family, but recalibrate the following knobs. (1) Make the tie-gap penalty conditional on later-cue structure: stronger when a single opposing late cue follows the tie gap (Experiment 18) and weaker when multiple opposing cues follow (Experiment 11), e.g. scale the penalty by 1/(1 + n_later) or add a single-opposing boost. (2) Strengthen the n>=12 position-1 first-cue discount or make long_early_polarity negative at n>=12 to fix the Experiment 6 sign error. (3) Reduce the magnitude of `mid_early_polarity` at n=8 to bring Experiments 4 and 17 closer to their real values. (4) Reduce the delayed-first-cue anti-weight (`late_anti_base` and/or `late_context_gain`) to raise following rates in Experiments 14 and 16. (5) Strengthen `n10_high_cue_discount` (lower its range) to reduce the Experiment 10 high-cue effect. (6) Strengthen long two-cue configural equalization to shrink the Experiment 13 adjacent-vs-nonadjacent gap. (7) Fix the unused `late_anti_unconditional_threshold` parameter and reconsider `short_single_opposing_ratio` so the validity-order release gate does not suppress the released opposing cue to near zero. These are minor in-family adjustments, not a mechanism-family switch.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0949 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1081 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The iter 2 candidate remains inside the prescribed run-gated ordered evidence accumulation family, and several previously identified problems improved: Experiment 11 went from -0.3275 to -0.1950 against a real value of -0.1867, Experiment 17 from -0.8683 to -0.7567 against -0.7433, Experiment 4 from -0.1773 to -0.1573 against -0.1173, Experiment 8 from 0.4179 to 0.3967 against 0.3475, Experiment 10 from 2.4289 to 2.3153 against 1.8744, and Experiment 18 from -0.0619 to -0.0898 against -0.2567. However, the aggregate loss increased from 0.0949 to 0.1081 and the candidate was rejected by the accept gate. The reason is clear from the trajectory: the calibration changes were too global and produced large regressions elsewhere. Experiment 2 collapsed from -0.3946 to -0.0804 against a real value of -0.3750, indicating that the strengthened single-opponent tie-gap multiplier and/or the widened mirror asymmetry destroyed the short-list anti-following pattern. Experiments 14 and 16 overshot delayed-cue following, moving from 0.1062 to 0.2796 and from 0.0689 to 0.2377 against real values of 0.1771 and 0.1383, showing the delayed-first-cue anti-weight was reduced too far. Experiment 13 worsened from 0.0872 to 0.1706 against 0.0231, so the stronger two-cue suppression did not equalize adjacent and nonadjacent displays; it made adjacent displays too first-cue-following. Experiment 6 remains sign-wrong at +0.0583 against -0.0633 despite the new negative n>=12 polarity, because the positive first_pos1_discount scalar is multiplying an already negative early weight and shrinking its anti-following magnitude rather than strengthening it. These patterns point to multiplicative gating being used where sign-reversing or position-conditional logic is needed.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Because the gate rejected this candidate, the next proposal should start from the accepted iter 1 base and reapply only the successful components with much tighter conditioning. First, do not apply the strengthened single-opponent tie-gap penalty as a global multiplicative factor on short lists. Make the strong penalty specific to the Experiment 18 structure: first cue followed by a run of at least two or three consecutive ties, with the single opposing cue appearing outside the early span, i.e. in the tail. In the Experiment 2 case the single opponent is inside the early span and often qualifies for the validity-order release, so that case should retain its prior anti-following. Also, the tie-gap penalty should be allowed to reverse the sign of the first-cue contribution, e.g. by subtracting a penalty term rather than multiplying a positive weight by a small positive factor, otherwise it can only approach neutrality and cannot produce the -0.2567 anti-following seen in Experiment 18. Second, restore most of the delayed-first-cue anti-weight for single delayed cues: choose a value between the iter 1 and iter 2 ranges, or add a conditional boost for isolated delayed discriminators, so Experiments 14 and 16 land near 0.14 to 0.18 rather than 0.24 to 0.28. Third, replace the separate early-suppression and tail-suppression tweaks in long two-cue configural displays with an explicit shared later-cue weight: within the long_two_cue_config branch, both later cues should receive the same effective contribution regardless of whether they fall inside or outside the early span, which is the direct way to equalize adjacent and nonadjacent displays in Experiment 13. Fourth, fix the n>=12 position-1 logic: skip the positive first_pos1_discount when early polarity is negative, or replace it with an amplification that increases the magnitude of the negative weight, so Experiment 6 moves toward a small negative first-cue following difference. Fifth, if the n10 high-cue discount is re-introduced, apply it after the same_run_gain multiplier or remove same_run_gain for the position-1 high cue at n=10, since the current ordering partially cancels the discount and leaves Experiment 10 too high. Keep the improved n=8 polarity and two-cue configural suppression values from the rejected candidate where they did not cause regressions, but do not widen mirror_asym in the same step. All of these are minor in-family recalibrations of the run-gated ordered evidence accumulation mechanism."
