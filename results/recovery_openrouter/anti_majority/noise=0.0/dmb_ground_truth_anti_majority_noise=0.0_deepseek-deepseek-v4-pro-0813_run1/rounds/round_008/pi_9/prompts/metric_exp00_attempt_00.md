# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=8):** [0.92, 0.75, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.8, 0.95, 0.9]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This untried n=8 design isolates the clearest parametric split between the two theories in the mid-length band. At n=8 the advocated model assigns a positive mid_early_polarity (0.20 to 1.80) to the first three positions, whereas the competing model assigns a negative mid_early_polarity (-1.50 to -0.30). All eight pairs hold positions 3 through 7 tied, so every discriminating cue is inside the early span. This makes the early block the only source of evidence. For pairs where the first cue and a same-side cue form a majority, the advocated model chooses the majority sign while the competing model reverses the early evidence and chooses the opposite product. Isolated-first configural pairs retain this sign reversal and additionally separate the two theories through their different two-cue early suppression factors. The all-early-same pairs provide strong sign-reversal tests, and the mixed-position A101 versus B010 pair is intentionally near-boundary but opposite in direction, giving a quantitative separation. Because n=8 disables the odd-one-out bonus in both theories and because the tail is entirely tied and every first discriminating cue is at position 0, the design attributes any directional crossover specifically to the mid-length early polarity difference.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People make binary quality choices by salience-weighted ordered evidence accumulation with subject-signed early-span polarity, a sharply length-gated odd-one-out bonus on short lists, and a context-gated tie-run reset for delayed first cues. On long lists early and tail blocks are decoupled so subject sign remains behaviorally visible, and exactly-two-cue long configural displays are equalized across adjacent and nonadjacent later-cue positions. Stated validity is a compressive attentional gain, and choices arise from noisy softmax with lapse.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People make binary quality choices through a bounded ordered evidence-accumulation process with three interacting components. Early discriminating cues receive strong primacy, but that primacy is length-band-specific: on very short lists (n<=5) a narrow validity-order/tie-gap gate suppresses a single opposing late cue inside the early span, producing the strong anti-first-validity signature; on n=7 lists the early block is a subject-level mixture of a zero-early branch and a moderately positive branch; on n=8 lists the early block is subject-signed negative; and on long lists (n>=9) the position-1 early cue is discounted outside of two-cue configural displays, while configural late blocks are suppressed on very long displays. A weakly weighted late tally block accumulates ordinary later cues, while delayed first discriminating cues receive a context-graded negative weight, making isolated late cues fall near chance after delayed-first-cue experience. The configural odd-one-out bonus is moderate on short lists and nearly off by n=6, and long two-cue configural displays are explicitly equalized across adjacent and nonadjacent later-cue positions. Stated validity enters only as a compressive attentional gain. A tie-gap immediately after the first cue suppresses both the first cue's direct evidence and the configural bonus, except in the narrow validity-order/tie-gap case where it is released. A subject-level mirror asymmetry generates the positive mirror effect. Choices arise from a noisy softmax with subject scale, bias, trial noise, and lapse.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "At n=8 the two theories differ most in the sign of mid_early_polarity: the advocated theory has a positive early polarity while the competing theory has a negative early polarity. In this design all discriminating cues are inside the early span and the tail is tied, so the first cue's sign propagates through the early block. On trials where the first two discriminating cues agree, the advocated theory should choose the product favored by those first cues, while the competing theory should reverse that early evidence and choose the opposite product. The metric therefore scores each qualifying trial as +1 when the response matches the first cue and -1 otherwise, then averages. It excludes the mixed + - + trials whose early evidence is near boundary and could be noisy. This gives a stable scalar near +1 under the advocated theory and near -1 under the competing theory."
