# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** This design uses a long 12-feature list to push the advocated capacity-sensitive accumulator into its flat-weight regime. With n_features=12, the advocated capacity_factor is (5/12)^14 ≈ 5e-6, so the exponential position gradient and the validity_power modulation are both effectively zero: the model becomes a flat tally of discriminating features with beta≈4.5 and epsilon≈0.1. The competing display-order TTB, by contrast, always stops at the first displayed discriminator and ignores all later evidence, with validity weakly modulating decisiveness. The 12 unique pairs form a 2 (first-discriminator validity: 0.55 at position 0 vs 0.90 at position 1) × 3 (full tally margin) × 2 (first-discriminator direction) factorial. Crucially, for A-first trials the full tally is negative or zero, and for B-first trials the full tally is positive or zero, so the two theories never make the same directional prediction. The advocated model predicts P(A) ≈ 0.05, 0.06, 0.50, 0.94, 0.95 for d = -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, with no validity effect. Display-order TTB predicts P(A) ≈ 0.72-0.77 for low-validity A-first, ≈ 0.93-0.97 for high-validity A-first, and mirrored values for B-first, with no tally-margin effect. This yields both qualitative directional dissociations and quantitative validity-modulation versus tally-margin dissociations. The 12 unique pairs are repeated 8 times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People scan the displayed features from left to right and accumulate a signed preference signal, without ever committing to a hard lexicographic stop. Each discriminating feature contributes an increment whose weight is a continuous function of serial position, stated validity, and list length. For short lists the position weight is a steep exponential primacy gradient, so the first discriminator dominates probabilistically rather than absolutely. As list length exceeds working-memory capacity the gradient collapses toward a flat weighting function, making the rule behave like a tallying heuristic on long lists. The accumulated score is passed through a softmax with inverse temperature beta, and an independent lapse probability permits occasional intention-independent errors.

**Parameters:**
- lambda_5: [0.692, 0.694]
- capacity_power: [14.0, 18.0]
- validity_power: [0.049, 0.051]
- beta: [4.51, 4.53]
- epsilon: [0.095, 0.105]
- validities: validities

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People execute a display-order Take The Best rule: they scan the physical feature vector left-to-right and stop at the first feature that discriminates between the two options. That first displayed discriminator determines the choice, and later features are ignored. If no feature discriminates, the person guesses. Stated validities do not reorder the scan, but they weakly modulate salience: a first discriminator with lower stated validity is used less decisively than one with higher stated validity. Response noise enters through softmax with inverse temperature beta plus a small lapse probability epsilon.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

The advocated capacity-sensitive accumulator has nearly flat weights for 12 features, so the same trials are decided by the accumulated tally. For the A-first index-1 trials the tally is negative or zero and for the B-first index-1 trials it is positive or zero, giving a B-rate difference near +0.59. The two theories therefore produce opposite signs and a large mean separation. Each category contains 24 trials per subject, so the metric also has low per-subject binomial variability."
