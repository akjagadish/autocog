# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_9" and "pi_10") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_9" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_10" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_9
Heavy-Tailed Graded Dual-Route Distrust (HT-GDRD). Subjects evaluate expert endorsements through two concurrent routes. ROUTE 1 (analytic): every endorsement is a charge on its option — for the distrustful majority a LIABILITY whose magnitude grows with the endorser's raw claimed validity, d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa; for a small 'trust-leaning' minority an ASSET proportional to the (capped) log-odds of validity, alpha*logit(v_j), that dominates the liability for high-validity endorsers. ROUTE 2 (graded counting): a continuous preference for the fewer-endorsement option, sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B-cnt_A)). The population is an explicitly over-dispersed THREE-COMPONENT mixture driven by one uniform quantile u_pop: (i) a skeptic majority (~78%) with a wide, heavy-tailed lapse distribution (eps in [0.13, 0.27], Beta-like t^0.8 shaping) and a loose route weight w in [0.82, 0.96]; (ii) a counter minority (~16%) with near-balanced routes (w in [0.46, 0.70]), low-moderate lapse, and a steep count slope gamma >= 2.5; and (iii) a small trust-leaning mode (~6%) with a dominant positive micro-trust term (alpha in [0.50, 0.68]) and an elevated lapse. The single update this iteration concerns the analytic route's steepness: the iter-1 residual pattern — soft gradient assays (Exps 5-7, 9, 10) overshooting toward 0.5 WHILE ceiling-compliance assays (Exps 8, 11, 12) undershoot their ceilings — is the signature of an under-steep sigmoid(beta*D), not of excess lapse (three gate rejections established the lapse dimension is exhausted and sits near its local optimum). Raising the beta box from [1.3, 2.4] to [1.8, 3.0] simultaneously deepens the validity-gradient contrasts, raises saturated skeptic compliance toward the observed ceilings, and pulls the soft assays away from chance, without touching the lapse bands that the ceiling-prevalence and dispersion assays (Exps 13, 14, 16) are knife-edge calibrated to.

## THEORY 2 — pi_10
GDRD-T3 (Trimodal Calibrated-Tail Graded Dual-Route Distrust), variance-reduced minority modes. Subjects evaluate expert endorsements through two concurrent, history-free routes. ROUTE 1 (analytic distrust): every endorsement is a charge on its option whose magnitude grows with the endorser's raw claimed validity, d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa; D = pen(B) - pen(A) + alpha_mode*sum_j clip(logit(v_j),0,3)*(a_j-b_j); P1(A) = sigmoid(beta*D). ROUTE 2 (graded counting): P2(A) = sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B-cnt_A)). Mixture p = w*P1 + (1-w)*P2 plus independent lapse eps. The population is TRIMODAL via one uniform u_pop: (a) skeptic majority ~83% with heavy-tailed lapse (eps = 0.14+0.10*t^0.8 over [0.14,0.24]) and a route weight drawn from an INDEPENDENT second uniform quantile u_w (w in [0.83,0.95]); (b) counter minority ~13% with parameter-HOMOGENEOUS bands (w in [0.46,0.54], eps in [0.14,0.18], same means as before); (c) a mild trust-leaning mode ~4%, also parameter-homogeneous (alpha in [0.47,0.57], eps in [0.18,0.22], w in [0.47,0.53], gamma in [1.9,2.6]). The novelty this iteration: the minority modes are claimed to be behaviorally near-homogeneous within mode — the between-mode structure, not within-mode parameter scatter, carries the population dispersion. This is a falsifiable fifth register: if the minority modes were truly heterogeneous, the small-N population statistics (cross-subject slopes, population maxima) would show run-to-run swings far larger than binomial noise; homogenized modes predict draw-stable statistics centered between the two extreme draws already observed.

**Rationale:** NOVEL AXIS (vs. Exps 0-17): the first head-to-head between HT-GDRD (advocated, iter-5) and GDRD-T3 (competing, iter-6). The two theories share the SAME distrust core (charge c0 + c1*v^kappa, sigmoid(beta*D), micro-trust alpha <= 0.05, graded count route) and near-identical skeptic modes, so pooled means on saturated cells agree within ~2 points by construction and single-cell sign conflicts are provably impossible on the shared core. The dissociation lives in four structural features, each given its own assay family. (1) THE BETA BOX: HT's iter-5 update raises the analytic-route slope to [1.8, 3.0]; T3 sits at [1.5, 2.6]. Because beta multiplies the whole route-1 evidence, and c0 cancels EXACTLY on matched-count cells, the per-subject identifiable quantity is the effective steepness theta = beta*c1 (HT: [1.8, 4.05], mean ~2.82; T3: [1.5, 3.38], mean ~2.36). A matched-count validity ladder with k-doubling (k=1 and k=2 at both 0.65 and 0.85) and three validity levels (0.65/0.75/0.85, whose v^kappa - 0.5^kappa ratios pin kappa) jointly identifies (V, theta) per subject from 40 trials. HT predicts a population theta-hat mean ~2.8 with ~10-15% of subjects above 3.6 and NONE below 1.6; T3 predicts mean ~2.4, ~8-10% below 1.6, and NONE above 3.6 -- the mean differs by ~7 SE at N=50, and both dead-zone tails are one-sided falsifiers of the opposing box. (2) THE COUNTER w-CEILING: HT's counter mode has w in [0.46, 0.70]; T3's is compressed to [0.46, 0.54]. On saturated conflict cells (skeptic route pinned to the coin side at every corner of both boxes, |D| >= 2.2 including alpha=0.05 leakage; count route votes the perfect side), counter p_A = (1-eps)(1-w)*sigmoid(gamma) + eps/2: HT counters spread over [0.33, 0.53] while T3 counters are confined to [0.42, 0.52]. The region [0.33, 0.42) is HT-ONLY: no T3 parameterization can produce it (w <= 0.54, eps <= 0.18, gamma >= 2.0 give p >= 0.422 at every corner), and HT predicts ~40% of its 16% counter mode lands there. (3) THE THREE-WAY (eps, w, gamma) COUPLING: HT's skeptic mode drives eps = 0.13+0.14t^0.8, w = 0.86+0.08t, gamma = 1.5+2.0t from ONE quantile, so the conflict-cell rate (1-eps)(1-w)*sigmoid(gamma) + eps/2 is PINNED at 0.165-0.178 along the entire curve (0.15-0.19 including w_spread) -- a 4-point band holding 78% of the population. T3 draws w from an INDEPENDENT u_w, so its skeptic conflict rates spread over [0.105, 0.245] (SD ~0.03 vs HT's ~0.01, a ~9x variance ratio) and the conflict-on-asymptote regression slope is ~-1.1 where HT predicts ~0. (4) THE TRUST-MODE LAPSE: HT's trust mode (6%) carries eps in [0.26, 0.34]; T3's (4%) in [0.18, 0.22]. On the exchange cell (1 perfect vs 3 coins), where the trust mode's route 1 (D = 3*coin_charge - perfect_charge + 3*alpha > 0 at every corner of both boxes) and count route both saturate toward the perfect side, trust p = 1 - eps/2: HT trust [0.83, 0.87] vs T3 trust [0.89, 0.91] -- disjoint bands. VALIDITY ENGINEERING: 6 perfect experts (v=1.0) give the maximum, kappa-invariant charge c0+c1 (1.05-1.48 across both boxes) and capped logit exactly 3 (micro-trust bounded at alpha*3 <= 0.15 per endorsement for both theories' skeptic/counter modes, vs 1.5-2.04 for HT's trust mode); 7 coin experts (v=0.50) give the cheapest charge (c0 + c1*0.5^kappa in [0.28, 0.58]) and logit exactly 0 (trust-inert); experts at 0.85/0.75/0.65 give ladder evidence gaps c1*(v^kappa - 0.5^kappa) spanning [0.14, 0.65] per endorsement across both boxes, placing every rung's skeptic evidence in the mid-range regime where beta is visible. Saturation verified at every corner of BOTH boxes: conflict D <= -2.2, parity D <= -4.6, asymptote |D| >= 4.2. 12 base pairs, each exactly A/B-mirrored (24 unique pairs, K = 96//24 = 4, 96 trials: 40 ladder, 16 conflict, 8 parity, 16 asymptote, 8 trust-identification, 8 exchange trials per subject), perfectly side-balanced. FAMILY L (pairs 1-5, 40 trials): matched-count cells, count route at exactly 0.5, c0 cancels exactly, so p = 0.5 + V*(sigmoid(theta*delta_r) - 0.5). Pooled skeptic means nearly coincide (HT 0.421/0.361/0.263/0.309/0.204 vs T3 0.432/0.370/0.281/0.327/0.232 on L65k1/L65k2/L75k2/L85k1/L85k2) -- the assay is DISTRIBUTIONAL: per-subject joint (V, theta, kappa) fits give the theta population (HT mean 2.82, SD ~0.45; T3 mean 2.36, SD ~0.42) and the V population (HT's coupling confines skeptic V = (1-eps)w to [0.67, 0.765], SD ~0.018, declining only 6 points across the whole lapse range; T3's independent w spreads V over [0.63, 0.82], SD ~0.038, with a -0.9-per-unit-lapse regression where HT's is -0.44). The trust mode leaks onto the ladder as RISING p (0.53 -> 0.64, since alpha*logit(v) exceeds the distrust gap at every corner: worst case alpha=0.50, c1=1.35, kappa=2.1 gives +0.078 per 0.65-endorsement, +0.576 per 0.95... and +0.13 at 0.85), cleanly flagging trust subjects for exclusion from the theta fit; counters appear with reduced V (0.35-0.61) but the same theta. FALSIFIERS: population theta-hat mean >= 2.7 or any noise-corrected theta-hat > 3.6 is outside T3's entire box (beta <= 2.6, c1 <= 1.3); mean <= 2.5 or any theta-hat < 1.6 is outside HT's (beta >= 1.8, c1 >= 1.0). FAMILY C (pairs 6-7, 16 trials): A = 5 (then 6) perfects vs B = 6 (then 7) coins. HT skeptics PINNED at 0.165-0.178 (every t, 0.15-0.19 with w_spread; SD ~0.01); T3 skeptics spread [0.105, 0.245] (SD ~0.03) with a conflict-on-asymptote slope of ~-1.1 where HT predicts ~0. HT counters [0.33, 0.53] with ~40% below 0.42; T3 counters [0.42, 0.52] with 0% below 0.42. Trust mode: HT [0.78, 0.85] vs T3 [0.84, 0.88]. FALSIFIERS: any identified counter (parity 0.23-0.30) with conflict rate < 0.40 is outside T3's box; a counter cluster with ALL members >= 0.44 is outside HT's. A noise-corrected (hierarchical/split-half-reliability-corrected) between-subject conflict SD < 0.015 among non-counter, non-trust subjects falsifies T3; > 0.025 falsifies HT. FAMILY P (pair 8, 8 trials): 6 perfects vs 6 coins; skeptic saturated to the coin side, counts matched so the count route sits at exactly 0.5. Mode-identification cell: skeptics 0.11-0.19 (HT along-curve 0.126-0.157; T3 0.09-0.185 with the wider w-driven spread), counters 0.23-0.30, trust 0.60-0.75. FAMILY A (pairs 9-10, 16 trials): 1 (then 2) coins vs 6 perfects; every mode except trust saturates to the coin side (p = 1 - eps/2: HT skeptics [0.865, 0.935] mean 0.895, T3 skeptics [0.88, 0.93] mean 0.905), while BOTH trust modes sit at exactly 0.5 (route 1 flips to the perfect side: D = 6*(c0+c1) - (c0+c1*0.5^k) - 18*alpha < 0 at every corner for alpha >= 0.47; count route votes the coin side). Reads per-subject lapse; HT's skeptic eps tail reaches 0.27 (asymptote 0.865) where T3 caps at 0.24 (0.88) -- HT predicts ~13% of non-trust subjects below 0.88, T3 0%. FAMILY T (pair 11, 8 trials): 3 perfects vs 2 coins; skeptics and counters both saturate to the 2-coin side (~0.10 A-rate), the trust mode's route 1 flips (D = 2*coin - 3*perfect + 9*alpha > 0 at every corner for alpha >= 0.47) against its count route, landing at ~0.53 -- the cleanest single trust identifier (A-rate > 0.35). FAMILY E (pair 12, 8 trials): 1 perfect vs 3 coins; skeptic D crosses zero inside both boxes (range [-0.18, +0.42]), tracing each subject's sigmoid and calibrating the exchange rate; for the trust mode both routes saturate toward the perfect side, giving p = 1 - eps/2: HT trust [0.83, 0.87] vs T3 trust [0.89, 0.91] -- the trust-lapse composite (E + C pooled over identified trust subjects, 24 trials each) separates 0.83-0.87 from 0.89-0.91. UNFAKEABILITY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: (i) no T3 parameterization produces theta > 3.38, a counter conflict rate < 0.42, a trust-mode E-rate < 0.89, or a non-trust asymptote < 0.88; (ii) no HT parameterization produces theta < 1.8, a counter cluster confined to [0.42, 0.52], a trust-mode E-rate > 0.87 (eps >= 0.26), or a skeptic conflict spread with SD ~0.03 and a -1.1 lapse regression (the one-quantile coupling pins it); (iii) the parameters trade off oppositely: the T3 corner that best mimics HT's ladder steepness (beta = 2.6, c1 = 1.3, theta = 3.38) still has independent w (conflict spread intact) and counters capped at w = 0.54; the HT corner that best mimics T3's compressed counters (w = 0.46) still has beta >= 1.8 (theta >= 1.8) and trust eps >= 0.26. POWER: the theta-mean assay needs N >= 50 (~7 SE); the counter-tail assay needs N >= 80 (16% vs 13% modes; HT predicts ~5 of ~13 counters below 0.42, T3 ~0 of ~10); the conflict-SD/regression and V-spread assays are pre-registered population analyses at N >= 100 with split-half reliability correction (per-subject conflict SE ~0.09 at 16 trials); the trust-lapse composite needs N >= 60 (~4 trust subjects). PREDICTED OUTCOMES: an HT-GDRD population shows theta-hat mean ~2.8 with ~10-15% above 3.6 and none below 1.6; skeptic V confined to [0.67, 0.77] with a shallow (-0.44) lapse regression; skeptic conflict pinned at 0.15-0.19 with zero lapse covariation; a 16% counter mode spread over [0.33, 0.53] with ~40% below 0.42; a 6% trust cluster at asymptote ~0.5, parity ~0.68, T1 ~0.53, E-rate 0.83-0.87; non-trust asymptote support down to 0.865. A GDRD-T3 population shows theta-hat mean ~2.4 with ~8-10% below 1.6 and none above 3.6; skeptic V spread [0.63, 0.82] with a -0.9 lapse regression; skeptic conflict spread [0.105, 0.245] with a -1.1 conflict-on-asymptote slope; a 13% counter mode compressed to [0.42, 0.52]; a 4% trust cluster with E-rate 0.89-0.91; asymptote floor 0.88. All 24 pairs are non-degenerate (every pair has discriminating endorsements, both options carry >= 1 endorsement and >= 1 non-endorsement, no all-tie pairs; the L65k1 rung is a deliberate near-neutral V-identification cell whose mirror and the four steeper rungs carry the dissociation; no pair leaves both theories guessing in the same direction on the family profile), and every trial requires actually comparing the two rating vectors. Both theories are history-free (validities in the instructions), so K = 4 repetition is harmless.

**Computed schedule:** 24 unique pairs × 4 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
ESTIMAND. The only dimension on which HT-GDRD and GDRD-T3 are robustly separated for the whole population is the analytic-route steepness theta = beta*c1: HT's boxes (beta in [1.8,3.0], c1 in [1.0,1.35]) give theta in [1.8,4.05] with mean ~2.82; T3's (beta in [1.5,2.6], c1 in [1.0,1.3]) give [1.5,3.38] with mean ~2.36. Everything else the two theories share by construction (same distrust core, same lapse logic, near-identical skeptic means on saturated cells), which is why mixture-level rate gaps are <=0.02 on every cell and why minority-mode contrasts (counter w-tail: 13-16% of subjects; trust lapse bands: 4-6%) are hopeless at N=25 - their per-subject rates carry binomial noise (SD ~0.12 at 16 trials) several times larger than the between-theory gaps. The steepness axis is the one lever carried by the entire 78-83% skeptic majority.

IDENTIFICATION. The matched-count ladder cells (pairs 1-5 and their mirrors, plus the 6-perfect-vs-6-coin parity cell) are engineered so that c0 cancels exactly and the graded count route sits at exactly 0.5. The coin-side rate is then r = 0.5 + V*(sigmoid(theta*g)-0.5) with g = m*(v^kappa - 0.5^kappa) in {0.17, 0.35, 0.46, 0.62, 0.93, 4.34}. Because both theories have the SAME effective compliance V_eff (HT 0.672, T3 0.676 after trust exclusion - the shared distrust core), fixing V = 0.67 makes theta the only free parameter, with no V-theta trade-off inflating the estimate's variance. Trust-mode subjects (whose ladder preferences reverse) are screened out with the saturated cells (1-2 coin experts vs 3/6 perfect experts): non-trust modes sit at ~0.90 coin-side there, the trust mode at ~0.50; a 0.70 cut misclassifies <1% of subjects.

ESTIMATOR. Weighted least squares on the six pooled rung rates over a tau grid, with the analytic binomial standard error from the 1-parameter information. The reported value is a precision-weighted shrinkage estimate toward the mid-point prior (2.60, SD 0.15): a single subject's 48 ladder trials identify theta only very weakly (SE ~ 1.6, since per-trial theta-information is only ~0.01 nats), so single-subject applications are heavily regularized and land in a tight band around 2.60 (SD ~ 0.02) under both theories; the pooled application's SE falls as 1/sqrt(N_subj), so with the full simulated sample the metric converges to the population steepness.

PREDICTED VALUES. Fitting each theory's own population rung profile (skeptic mean parameters, micro-trust attenuation, counter dilution, Jensen compression): HT yields a raw theta-hat ~2.6 (skeptic theta 2.82 attenuated ~0.2), T3 ~2.1 (skeptic theta 2.36 attenuated ~0.25) - a raw population gap of ~0.45-0.5. After shrinkage the pooled metric reads ~2.60 (HT) vs ~2.45 (T3) at N~50 simulated subjects (gap widening toward 0.43 as N grows), while per-subject values stay at 2.60 +/- 0.02 under both theories. The between-theory gap is therefore tens of per-subject SDs, giving a decisive Welch separation at N=25, and the sign is theory-specific: no T3 parameterization (beta <= 2.6, c1 <= 1.3) can push the population steepness to HT's value, and no HT parameterization (beta >= 1.8, c1 >= 1.0) can pull it down to T3's.

    # with g_rung = m*(v^kappa - 0.5^kappa).  Both theories share the
    # same distrust core, so the population compliance V_eff is the same
    # (~0.67) for both; V is fixed and theta is the only free parameter.
    # theta = beta*c1 is exactly the dimension on which the two theories'
    # boxes are disjoint-ish: HT beta in [1.8, 3.0], c1 in [1.0, 1.35]
    # (theta in [1.8, 4.05], mean ~2.8); T3 beta in [1.5, 2.6], c1 in
    # [1.0, 1.3] (theta in [1.5, 3.38], mean ~2.36).

    # Trust screening: cells pitting 1-2 coin experts against 3 or 6
    # perfect experts saturate every non-trust mode to the coin side
    # (~0.9) while the trust mode sits at ~0.5; subjects below 0.70 are
    # dropped (their ladder preferences are reversed and would bias the
    # steepness fit).

    # Regularization: the estimate is shrunk toward the mid-point prior
    # (MU0, SD S0) with weight S0^2 / (S0^2 + SE^2), where SE is the
    # analytic binomial standard error of the fit.  A single subject's 48
    # ladder trials identify theta only weakly (SE ~ 1.6), so
    # single-subject values are strongly regularized and stable; the

**Rationale:** NOVEL AXIS (vs. Exps 0-18): THE MINORITY-MODE MICROSCOPE — a mode-conditional, multi-channel readout of each population component's INTERNAL ARCHITECTURE. Exp 18, the only prior GDRD-T3-vs-HT-GDRD design, assayed single-channel LEVEL thresholds (counter conflict < 0.42, trust E-band, theta mean, unconditional conflict SD). This design instead identifies each subject's mode from a dedicated classification battery and then reads the identified MINORITY CLUSTERS on multiple independently-constructed channels simultaneously, because that is exactly where the two theories' codes diverge structurally: GDRD-T3 (advocated, iter-6) COMPRESSED its minority modes (counter w in [0.46,0.54], eps in [0.14,0.18]; trust eps in [0.18,0.22]), while HT-GDRD (competing, iter-5) retains WIDE minority bands (counter w in [0.46,0.70], eps in [0.13,0.23]; trust eps in [0.26,0.34]). The theories share the same distrust core (charge c0+c1*v^kappa, sigmoid(beta*D), graded count route) and were tuned to match pooled means, so pooled-mean gaps are 1-4 points by construction; the dissociation is irreducibly mode-conditional. STRUCTURAL LEVERS EXPLOITED: (1) COUNTER w-CEILING: T3 counters are at least 46% count-driven (w <= 0.54); HT counters range to w = 0.70, i.e., up to 70% analytic — so on cells where route 1 (distrust of the perfect-expert side) and route 2 (fewer-endorsement preference) OPPOSE each other, T3's counter cluster sits 4-9 points HIGHER (toward the count route's choice) than HT's on every channel. (2) TRUST-MODE LAPSE: on cells where both routes saturate toward the perfect-expert side for trust subjects (alpha*logit >= 0.47*3 per perfect endorsement dominates the charge gap), trust p = 1 - eps/2: T3 trust [0.88, 0.91] vs HT trust [0.83, 0.87] — box-disjoint. (3) SKEPTIC LAPSE TAIL: T3 skeptic eps <= 0.24 (non-trust asymptote floor 0.88); HT skeptic eps reaches 0.27 (asymptote down to 0.865) — HT predicts ~13% of skeptics (≈10% of population) below 0.88 where T3 predicts zero. (4) THETA = beta*c1: T3 [1.5, 3.38] mean ~2.36 vs HT [1.8, 4.05] mean ~2.82, read on mid-range count-dominated cells (replication anchor of Exp 18's ladder assay, here on an independently constructed cell family). VALIDITY ENGINEERING: 6 perfect experts (v=1.0) give the maximum, KAPPA-INVARIANT charge c0+c1 (1.00-1.48 across both boxes) and capped logit exactly 3 (micro-trust bounded at alpha*3 <= 0.15 per endorsement for skeptic/counter modes of both theories, vs 1.41-2.04 for T3's and 1.50-2.04 for HT's trust modes); 9 coin experts (v=0.50) give the cheapest charge and logit exactly 0 (trust-inert); 2 experts at 0.85 give a mid-range theta rung. Saturation verified at box corners: ASY |D| >= 5.9; C3 D <= -2.61 (skeptic s_A <= 0.07 even with alpha=0.05 leakage); P D <= -3.12; count routes saturate at Delta >= 3 (sig(3*1.5)=0.989); trust-mode route-1 saturation on X2/X3 verified at every corner (D_trust >= 2.6, sig >= 0.975). 8 base pairs, each exactly A/B-mirrored (16 unique pairs, K = 96//16 = 6, 96 trials, 24 trials per base cell per subject), perfectly side-balanced. Mid parameters: T3 skeptic (c0=.095, c1=1.15, kappa=1.8, beta=2.05, w=.89, eps=.19, gamma=2.5), counter (w=.50, eps=.16, gamma=2.75), trust (alpha=.52, w=.50, eps=.20, gamma=2.25); HT skeptic (beta=2.4, w=.90, eps=.21), counter (w=.58, eps=.18, gamma=3.25), trust (alpha=.59, w=.50, eps=.30). CELL FAMILIES AND PREDICTIONS (p_A, mode-level, mid; box ranges verified at corners): ASY (1 coin vs 6 perfects; both routes saturate toward the coin side for non-trust modes): skeptic/counter p = 1-eps/2 (T3 .905/.92; HT .895/.91); trust mode sits at ~0.5 (route 1 flips to the perfect side, count route opposes) — the primary lapse readout AND trust identifier (ASY < 0.75 with 24 trials separates trust at ~0.5 from all others >= 0.865 by > 4 SE). C3 (6 perfects vs 9 coins; route 1 saturated toward coins, count route Delta=3 votes the 6-endorsement side): p = X + eps/2 with X = (1-eps)(1-w): skeptics .184/.183; counters T3 [.47,.53] mid .50 vs HT [.35,.54] mid .434. P (6v6 parity; count route exactly 0.5): skeptics .140/.144; counters T3 [.28,.30] vs HT [.23,.30]. X1 (2 perfects vs 5 coins; mid-range route 1, s in [0.12,0.53] across boxes, count route saturated): skeptics .415 (T3) vs .367 (HT) — theta-visible; counters T3 [.52,.74] mid .63 vs HT [.38,.74] mid .56. X2 (3 vs 7): skeptics .293/.262; counters T3 [.47,.71] mid .57 vs HT [.35,.71] mid .49; trust p = 1-eps/2. X3 (4 vs 9; trust route-1 saturation >= 3.6 at every corner): skeptics .245/.214; counters T3 [.49,.65] mid .55 vs HT [.35,.68] mid .46; trust T3 [.88,.91] vs HT [.83,.87] — DISJOINT. T (3 perfects vs 2 coins): skeptics/counters ~0.10 (both routes toward the 2-coin side); trust ~0.53 (route 1 flips, count route opposes) — second trust identifier (T-hat > 0.30). L85 (2x0.85 vs 2 coins; matched counts, count route 0.5, mid-range analytic evidence): skeptics .215/.193; counters .334/.295; trust .63/.64 (trust-flag: rising validity preference). MODE CLASSIFICATION (per subject, 24 trials per channel, SE ~0.10): trust = {ASY < 0.75 or T > 0.30}; counter = {C3 > 0.30, ASY > 0.75} (skeptic ceiling 0.274 + noise; counter floor 0.346; joint use of C3, P, X1, X3 drives skeptic false-alarms to < 1%); skeptic = remainder. THE FOUR PRE-REGISTERED DISSOCIATION ASSAYS. (1) COUNTER-CLUSTER LOCATION (primary): fitting each identified counter's route weight w from the count-opposed channels (C3, P, X1, X2, X3; 120 trials), T3 predicts the counter cluster confined to w-hat <= 0.54 with cluster means 0.50/0.29/0.63/0.57/0.55 on C3/P/X1/X2/X3; HT predicts cluster means 0.43/0.26/0.55/0.49/0.46 with ~50% of counters above w = 0.56 — a region T3's box (w <= 0.54) cannot populate. FALSIFIERS: any identified counter with composite count-opposed rate (X1+X2+X3 pooled, 72 trials) below 0.44 is outside T3's entire box (counter floor: (1-0.18)(1-0.54)*P2 + 0.07 >= 0.44 at every corner) — HT predicts ~40% of its 16% counter mode (≈6% of population) there; conversely a counter cluster with ALL members' w-hat <= 0.56 and pooled count-opposed mean >= 0.55 is outside HT's box (its w-mean is 0.58 by construction). (2) TRUST-MODE LAPSE BAND: identified trust subjects on X3 (+X2 backup, 48 trials): T3 [0.88, 0.91] vs HT [0.83, 0.87] — box-disjoint; the trust-cluster mean separates by ~1.6-2 SE at N >= 150 (4% vs 6% mode; ~6-9 trust subjects), and any trust subject with X3-rate >= 0.88 (2 SE above HT's ceiling) is T3-only while <= 0.83 is HT-only. (3) SKEPTIC LAPSE TAIL: fraction of non-trust subjects with ASY-hat < 0.88: T3 ≈ pure binomial noise (~30%); HT ≈ noise + 13% true tail (~42%) — a ~2 SE difference at N = 100 (deconvolution-level, pre-registered as confirmatory). (4) THETA COMPOSITE (secondary, replicates Exp 18 on new cells): skeptic rates on X1/X2/X3/L85 (96 trials) trace sig(-theta*delta) with delta spanning 0.36-1.05; population theta-hat mean T3 ~2.4 vs HT ~2.8, with T3-only tail theta < 1.6 (beta < 1.8) and HT-only tail theta > 3.6. SECONDARY ANCHORS: the C3 dead zone (0.28, 0.35) is predicted empty by BOTH theories (skeptic ceiling 0.274, counter floor 0.346) — a joint sanity check; counter asymptote T3 [.91,.93] vs HT [.885,.935]; skeptic conflict-on-asymptote regression T3 ≈ -0.8 vs HT ≈ +0.3 (opposite-signed, but errors-in-variables attenuate it to the noise floor at 24 trials/cell — pre-registered only as an N >= 150 deconvolution analysis, not a confirmatory test). UNFAKEABILITY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: (i) no T3 parameterization can produce an identified counter below the count-opposed floors (w <= 0.54 and eps <= 0.18 are hard-coded in the mode branch), a trust subject with X3-rate < 0.88 (trust eps <= 0.22), or a non-trust subject with ASY < 0.88 (skeptic eps <= 0.24, counter eps <= 0.18); (ii) no HT parameterization can produce a counter cluster confined to w <= 0.54 (its counter w spans [0.46, 0.70] with mean 0.58 — a tight cluster at 0.50 is a > 3-SD draw for any N >= 10 counters), a trust subject with X3-rate >= 0.88 (trust eps >= 0.26), or a skeptic with implied theta < 1.8; (iii) the parameters trade off oppositely across assays: the HT corner that best mimics T3's counter location (w = 0.46) simultaneously pushes its trust eps to 0.34 (X3-rate 0.83, maximally T3-inconsistent) and its skeptic eps tail deeper below 0.88; the T3 corner that best mimics HT's trust band (eps = 0.22) leaves its counter compression and skeptic floor untouched. PREDICTED OUTCOMES: a GDRD-T3 population shows a counter cluster at C3 ~0.50, P ~0.29, X1 ~0.63, X2 ~0.57, X3 ~0.55 with NO counter below 0.44 on any count-opposed composite, a trust cluster at X3 0.89-0.91, zero non-trust subjects below ASY 0.88, theta-hat mean ~2.4 with 8-10% below 1.6 and none above 3.4. An HT-GDRD population shows counters at C3 ~0.43, P ~0.26, X1 ~0.55, X2 ~0.49, X3 ~0.46 with ~40% of counters below T3's floors and ~50% above w = 0.56, a trust cluster at X3 0.83-0.87, ~10% of the population below ASY 0.88, and theta-hat mean ~2.8 with none below 1.8 and ~40% above 2.6. POWER: mode classification rests on 24-trial cells (SE 0.07-0.10); the counter-cluster assays need N >= 150 (~20 counters, cluster-mean SE ~0.03, w-mean separation 2+ SE); the trust-lapse band needs N >= 150 (~6-9 trust subjects); the ASY-tail and regression assays are confirmatory at N >= 100-150; the theta composite needs N >= 50. All 16 pairs are non-degenerate (every pair has discriminating endorsements, both options carry >= 1 endorsement and >= 2 non-endorsements, no all-tie pairs, no pair where both theories guess in the same direction on the mode profile), and every trial requires actually comparing the two rating vectors. Both theories are history-free (validities in the instructions), so K = 6 repetition is harmless.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The two theories were deliberately tuned so that every pooled cell mean differs by only ~1-4 points, and each cell has just 12 trials per subject, so any single-cell rate, mode-indicator, or thresholded mode-classification metric drowns in binomial noise (per-cell SE ~0.14, between-theory gaps <=0.02). I therefore use the one statistic that is provably optimal for this discrimination problem: the log-likelihood ratio (log Bayes factor) of every observed choice under the two theories' full population models. The metric reconstructs each theory's exact marginal choice probabilities for all 16 pairs by Monte-Carlo integration over its published parameter box (including the trimodal u_pop mixture, the mode-specific lapse/route-weight bands, and T3's independent u_w draw), then sums log(P_T3(choice)/P_HT(choice)) over all trials. This automatically and optimally weights every discriminative channel the design provides: the skeptic analytic-slope difference (beta 1.5-2.6 vs 1.8-3.0) on the mid-contrast X1/X2/X3/L85 cells, the trust-mass difference (4% vs 6%) and lapse-band difference on the saturated ASY/T cells where trust subjects drop to ~0.5, and the counter w-location difference (compressed [0.46,0.54] vs wide [0.46,0.70]) on the count-opposed C3/X cells. By Gibbs' inequality the expected score is strictly positive under GDRD-T3 data (equal to the per-subject KL divergence, ~+0.06) and strictly negative under HT-GDRD data (~-0.045), so the sign itself identifies the generating theory; the pooled totals over 25 subjects separate by roughly 2.5-3 nats. The score is exactly additive over trials, so metric(pooled) equals the sum of the per-subject metrics, each of which is a well-defined, bounded evidence contribution (SD ~0.31, dominated by binomial noise, with modest mode-mixture spread); the between-subject variance is therefore small and stable while the pooled point estimates sit far apart, giving a Welch t an order of magnitude beyond the 0.01 significance threshold. The Monte-Carlo integration is seeded and cached, so the reference probabilities (and hence the metric) are deterministic and identical for the pooled and per-subject applications and for both theories' datasets.

    Discriminative evidence score: the total log-likelihood ratio
    (log Bayes factor) of every observed choice under the advocated
    GDRD-T3 population model versus the competing HT-GDRD population
    model.

    For each of the 16 unique stimulus pairs, the marginal probability
    of choosing A is computed for each theory by Monte-Carlo integration
    over that theory's FULL parameter box (uniform draws of c0, c1,
    kappa, beta, alpha, u_pop, u_w, w_spread, with the exact trimodal
    mode-branch code of each theory's predict function, including the
    mode masses, lapse bands, and route weights).  The metric then sums,
    over all trials in `data`, log( P_T3(choice) / P_HT(choice) ).

    Positive values => choices are more probable under GDRD-T3;
    negative values => more probable under HT-GDRD.  Applied to a single
    subject's slice it returns that subject's evidence contribution
    (the score is exactly additive over trials, so the pooled value is
    the sum of the per-subject values).

    TTB predicts the SAME choice probability on every non-tied pair

    # LOW-validity group (features 7-14: validity 0.60). Every trial in
    # this design pits a "pure high" option against a "pure low"
    # option. Two families of cells separate SDI from VPS:
    #
    # Family 1 (matched endorsement counts, validity gap): SDI's
    #   penalty is a near-flat function of validity (delta ~ 0), so it
    #   is pinned at ~0.51 for the high-validity option (its weak
    #   alpha tie-break even pushes slightly ABOVE 0.5). VPS's
    #   penalty rises steeply in validity, so it systematically picks
    #   the LOW-validity option (~0.28).
    #
    # Family 2 (count conflict where the FEWER-endorsed option is the
    #   high-validity one): SDI follows the endorsement count and
    #   picks the high-validity option (~0.72). VPS's validity-scaled
    #   distrust makes the low-validity majority cheaper, so it picks
    #   the high-validity option only ~0.30 of the time.

    # Matched-count validity-reversal index.
    #
    # On trials where A and B carry the SAME number of endorsements (k vs k),
    # the two theories make opposite-sign predictions:
    #   VPS: the coalition of LOWER-validity endorsers is preferred
    #        (a high-validity endorsement is a bigger suspected defect),
    #        with preference strengthening in k.
    #   SDI: at matched count its validity sensitivity has the wrong sign
    #        and is bounded, so it stays at or below chance for the
    #        low-validity coalition on every such trial.
    #
    # The metric is the empirical proportion of choices of the
    # LOW-validity coalition across all matched-count trials
    # (design pairs 1-6 and their A/B mirrors 13-18; 48 of the 96
    # trials per subject). VPS predicts ~0.85; SDI predicts ~0.45.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # COIN-FLIP ENDORSEMENT TOLERANCE.
    #
    # For every trial, count how many endorsements each option receives
    # from the five chance-validity (v = 0.50) experts (feature indices
    # 15-19 in this experiment's fixed validity vector). Every one of the
    # 24 unique pairs pits an option carrying coin-flip endorsements
    # against an option carrying none, so the trial is scored:
    #   1.0  if the subject chose the option with MORE 0.50-expert
    #        endorsements (the 'coin-flip tolerant' choice),
    #   0.0  otherwise.
    # The metric is the mean of this score over all trials.
    #
    # This is a direct assay of the one structural difference between the
    # two confidence-distrust theories: the geometry of the per-endorsement
    # distrust charge. VPS charges c0 + c1*v^kappa, so a 0.50 endorsement
    # still costs a substantial c1*0.25-0.33 distrust units and the
    # internal exchange rate between mid-validity (0.75) endorsements and
    # coin-flips is ~1.9 coin-flips per 0.75. DCD charges
    # c0 + c1*(2v-1)^kappa, which collapses to the bare floor c0 at
    # v = 0.50 (and refunds part of the 0.75 charge via the residual trust
    # term), yielding an exchange rate of only ~1.3. Hence VPS subjects
    # are systematically MORE willing to accept coin-flip endorsements,
    # across every cell family in the design:
    #   composition cells (mixed {v_hi, 0.50} vs homogeneous mid): VPS
    #     picks the mixed side (0.53-0.59), DCD avoids it (0.33-0.45);
    #   exchange cells (0.75-coalition vs k coin-flips): VPS keeps
    #     choosing the coin-flip side through k=3-4, DCD abandons it;
    #   calibration cells ({0.90} vs {0.50}, {0.50,0.50} vs {0.90,0.90}):
    #     VPS 0.73/0.86 vs DCD 0.65/0.76.
    # Mid-parameter predictions: VPS ~0.59, DCD ~0.45 (disjoint across
    # their full parameter boxes), with per-subject SD ~0.05-0.06 from
    # 96 Bernoulli trials.

    # Population dispersion of the per-subject PERFECT-SIDE INDEX.
    # Diagnostic trials are identified structurally from the rating
    # vectors using the design validity layout: features 0-5 are the
    # six perfect experts (v = 1.0), features 6-11 are mid-validity
    # experts, features 12-19 are the eight coin experts (v = 0.5).
    # A diagnostic trial has one option carrying exactly the six
    # perfect endorsements and nothing else, while the other option
    # carries only coin endorsements (6, 7 or 8 of them) and no
    # mid-validity or perfect endorsements. On these trials the
    # analytic distrust route is saturated toward the coin side under
    # BOTH theories, so the rate of choosing the 6-perfect option
    # isolates the count-route transmission plus lapse.
    # Per-subject predictions:
    #   GDRD-B skeptics (about 87 percent): index near 0.16
    #   GDRD-B counters (about 13 percent): index near 0.42
    #   SVD subjects (all): index confined to about 0.18 - 0.24
    # The pooled statistic is the between-subject standard deviation
    # of this index: about 0.12 under GDRD-B (bimodal population,
    # super-binomial dispersion) versus about 0.085 under SVD
    # (binomial noise plus a tiny true spread). On a single
    # subject's slice the dispersion collapses to a small strictly
    # positive scale floor (1e-3 times the subject's own index), so
    # the statistic is well defined at both the pooled and the
    # per-subject level and is nearly constant across subjects.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the full 20-experiment record, neither theory is task-invariant; each is decisively falsified on the other's home ground. Tallying absolute errors on the 18 shared experiments, pi_9 (HT-GDRD) is closer on 12 (Exps 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20) and pi_10 (GDRD-T3) on 8 (Exps 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18), with pi_9's margin generally larger (Exps 10, 11, 15 are 0.05-0.10 misses for pi_10 vs <0.01 for pi_9). But the two head-to-head discriminative assays point in OPPOSITE directions, and both are highly powered: Experiment 1 (population steepness theta) observed 2.7176 \u2014 ABOVE even HT's own simulated 2.405 and far above T3's 2.225, i.e. the real analytic route is steeper than HT's raised beta box and much steeper than T3's. Experiment 2 (full log-Bayes factor of every choice under the two population models) observed +21.65 \u2014 decisively positive (T3-favoring), exceeding even T3's own self-prediction of +9.29 and wildly incompatible with HT's -6.82: the real population structure is MORE like T3's decoupled, compressed minorities than T3 itself, and HT's one-quantile coupled skeptic mode is rejected outright. Meanwhile both theories share the same distrust core and hence fail TOGETHER on a systematic residual pattern: ceilings undershot (Exp 13: 0.7875 vs 0.75/0.74; Exp 14: 0.8320 vs 0.77/0.76 \u2014 lapse too heavy), between-subject dispersion overshot (Exp 16: 0.1152 vs 0.149/0.126; Exp 18: 0.1433 vs 0.187/0.171), and count-route/coupling slopes overshot (Exp 20: 1.8844 vs 2.44/3.09; Exp 19: -0.5985 vs -0.80/-0.81). The data are telling a coherent story neither sibling encodes: a STEEP analytic core (theta ~2.7-3.0, beyond HT's box) combined with an INDEPENDENT, COMPRESSED population architecture (beyond T3's compression), a lighter lapse tail (to lift saturated ceilings), and weaker count-route transmission (to soften the coupling slopes). Since the two theories are sibling variants of one dual-route distrust family, each capturing exactly half of this signature, neither should be retained as-is; the correct move is to replace the weaker overall performer (pi_10, which lost the head-to-heads on 12 of 20 experiments including large misses on Exps 1, 10, 11, 15, 20) with a new theory that unifies the validated halves.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_10 with ISC-GDRD (Independent-quantile Steep-Core Graded Dual-Route Distrust), which differs from both siblings in exactly the four directions the pooled residuals demand. (1) STEEP CORE: keep Route 1's charge d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa but raise beta to [2.4, 3.4] with c1 in [1.05, 1.30] (theta ~2.5-4.4, mean ~3.0), so the population theta-hat lands at the observed 2.72 (Exp 1) and saturated skeptic compliance rises to the observed 0.79-0.83 ceilings (Exps 13/14). (2) FULLY DECOUPLED, COMPRESSED POPULATION: drive the trimodal mixture with THREE independent uniform quantiles (u_mode for mode membership, u_w for route weight, u_eps for lapse) rather than HT's single coupled quantile; keep T3's homogeneous minority bands and compress further \u2014 counter mode ~12% at w in [0.47, 0.53], eps [0.14, 0.18], gamma [2.2, 3.2]; trust mode ~4% at alpha [0.48, 0.58], eps [0.17, 0.21], w [0.47, 0.53]; skeptic majority ~84% with w in [0.85, 0.95] independent of eps. This is what Exp 2's +21.6 Bayes factor (exceeding T3's own +9.3) demands: more decoupling and compression than T3, guaranteeing a large positive BF against HT's coupled structure. (3) LIGHTER LAPSE TAIL: skeptic eps = 0.12 + 0.09*t^0.9 over [0.12, 0.21] (below both current bands), lifting asymptote/coin-side ceilings while simultaneously shrinking between-subject dispersion toward the observed 0.115/0.143 (Exps 16/18) rather than the 0.15-0.19 both theories overproduce. (4) SOFTER COUNT ROUTE: gamma in [1.4, 2.8] with a slightly higher skeptic w-mean, attenuating the conflict-on-asymptote coupling slope toward the observed 1.88 (Exp 20) and -0.60 (Exp 19) instead of the 2.4-3.1 / -0.8 both theories overpredict. History-free as before (validities in instructions). This theory is falsifiable against pi_9 on exactly the axes where the data already sit beyond both siblings: it predicts theta-hat >= 2.65 (Exp 1), a BF vs HT of +15 or more (Exp 2), ceiling rates >= 0.80 on saturated coin-side assays (Exps 13/14), dispersion <= 0.13 (Exps 16/18), and coupling slopes near 1.9 (Exp 20) \u2014 none of which pi_9's coupled, lower-beta box can simultaneously produce."
