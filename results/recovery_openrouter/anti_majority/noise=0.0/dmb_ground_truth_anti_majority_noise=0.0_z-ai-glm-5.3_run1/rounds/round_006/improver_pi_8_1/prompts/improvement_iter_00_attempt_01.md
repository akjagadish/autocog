# improvement_iter_00_attempt_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a NEW model instantiation of an EXISTING theory, given arbiter feedback on the previous instantiation. The theory's prose claim is fixed — you are NOT redefining the theory. You are regenerating only the runnable bits: the `predict` function, the `policy` function, and the `parameters` ranges. The newly proposed model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The goal of the model improvement process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
If your model fails to compile or behaves badly, you may receive feedback and have to propose another instantiation. Iterate until accepted.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new model instance that ignores the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ROUND THEORIES
The arbiter compared the two theories below this round. Your job is to regenerate ONLY the runnable bits (`predict`, `policy`, `parameters`) of the one tagged **TO REVISE**, keeping its description verbatim. The other theory is shown for context — it is NOT being changed.

### THEORY 1 — `pi_7` (other theory — context only, NOT revised)

**Description:**
Softened Validity-Distrust with Count Mixture (SVD). Every expert endorsement is a liability whose magnitude increases monotonically in the endorser's RAW claimed validity: d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa, with no dampening near v=0.5 and no trust refund. Decision making is a dual-process mixture at the trial level: with probability w the subject is a 'skeptic' who integrates the accumulated-suspicion difference D = P(B) - P(A) through sigmoid(beta*D); with probability (1-w) the subject is a 'counter' who simply chooses the option with FEWER total endorsements (indifferent at matched counts). Two heterogeneity mechanisms soften the pooled extremes and capture between-subject variability: (i) the sigmoid slope beta is sampled from a WIDE per-subject range, so the population is a mixture of shallow and steep sigmoids — sensitive near D=0 (matched-count validity-composition trials) yet compressed at large |D| (unequal-count trials); (ii) the uniform lapse epsilon is also sampled from a wide per-subject range, which pulls every saturated large-D assay toward 0.5 while adding genuine between-subject dispersion in overall choice rates.

### THEORY 2 — `pi_8` **TO REVISE**

**Description (PRESERVE VERBATIM — do not rewrite the prose):**
Graded Dual-Route Distrust with a Bimodal Strategy Population (GDRD-B). Subjects evaluate expert endorsements through two concurrent routes. ROUTE 1 (analytic distrust): every endorsement is a liability whose magnitude grows monotonically in the endorser's RAW claimed validity, d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa; accumulated suspicion P(X) = sum_j x_j*d_j is compared across options through sigmoid(beta*(P(B)-P(A))), plus a small residual micro-trust edge alpha*sum_j clip(logit(v_j),0,3)*(a_j-b_j) (capped so perfect experts exert bounded, not unbounded, trust pull). ROUTE 2 (graded counting): a continuous preference for the fewer-endorsement option, sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B-cnt_A)). The population is BIMODAL in the route weight w: a large majority (~88%) of 'skeptics' (w in [0.85, 0.95], moderate lapse) coexists with a minority (~12%) of 'counters' (w in [0.50, 0.62], low lapse, decisive count slope gamma >= 2). The mixture is implemented as a quantile transform of a single uniform per-subject population variable u_pop, which holds the population-MEAN route weight at its base value while exploding the between-subject behavioral variance — the empirically observed 3-12x super-binomial variance on the saturation assays (Exps 11, 12) that no uniform range-widening could reproduce.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_8`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_8`).

Keep the GDRD-B description (dual-route distrust with graded counting and bimodal route-weight population) intact; regenerate the parameter ranges and population mapping as follows. (1) LAPSE RECALIBRATION (fixes Exp 1): raise the skeptic-majority epsilon range from [0.08, 0.18] to approximately [0.14, 0.28] (mean ~0.21) and the counter-minority epsilon range from [0.05, 0.10] to approximately [0.10, 0.20]. Verify against Exp 1's ceiling-prevalence metric: per-subject saturation accuracy should now fall in ~[0.86, 0.95], yielding a pooled ceiling prevalence near the observed 0.28 rather than 0.52, while the conflict-compliance assays (Exps 13/14, observed 0.7875/0.8320) remain matched since (1-eps)*w + eps/2 is only mildly sensitive in this regime. (2) DISPERSION AMPLIFICATION (fixes the systematically underestimated between-subject variances): increase the counter-mode fraction from 0.12 to ~0.15-0.20, widen the skeptic w range to [0.80, 0.95] and the counter w range to [0.45, 0.62], and add modest within-mode jitter in w (e.g., the quantile-transform value plus a small independent per-subject perturbation) so the population variance on the saturation/conflict assays grows 2-4x while E[w] stays ~0.84, preserving the excellent mean-level fits on Exps 3-11. (3) Verify the Exp 2 v-metric is preserved: with the higher epsilon, counters' (x-0.21)^2 term (driven by the count route, lapse-robust) should continue to dominate their (r-0.96)^2 shortfall, keeping RMS(v) near 0.10-0.12; if skeptic x drifts too close to the 0.21 reference, lower the skeptic w floor to 0.80 to restore separation. (4) Keep the graded count slope gamma in [1.5, 3.5], the capped-logit micro-trust alpha in [0, 0.05], and recalibrate (c0, c1, kappa) only as needed to preserve the matched-count validity-reversal fits (Exps 10/11: observed 0.78/0.37, both currently well captured).

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.542)

**Description**
Validity-Proportional Skepticism (VPS), a.k.a. Confidence-Distrust Defect Integration. Subjects treat every expert endorsement not as an asset but as a liability whose magnitude scales with the endorser's claimed validity: a highly valid expert's praise is a strong claim, and strong claims attract the most suspicion. On each trial the decision maker computes a penalty for each option, P(X) = sum_j x_j * (c0 + c1 * v_j^kappa), where c0 is a flat defect-count term (c1 = 0 recovers pure unweighted defect counting) and c1 * v_j^kappa is the confidence-distrust term, with penalty INCREASING in the endorser's validity and kappa controlling how steeply. The subject chooses the lower-penalty option via P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. History is ignored because validities are communicated in the instructions, so skepticism weights are fixed for the whole block. VPS reproduces the sign of every observed metric while fixing the one structural blind spot of pure defect counting (SDI): on matched-count trials with a large validity gap (e.g., a single 0.90 endorser vs a single 0.60 endorser), SDI is pinned at 0.5 while VPS predicts a clear majority for the LOWER-validity endorser — exactly what the Experiment 6 composite (observed 0.193) requires.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.506)

**Description**
Dampened Confidence-Distrust Integration (DCD). Every expert endorsement is treated as a liability whose magnitude grows with the endorser's claimed validity: a highly valid expert's praise is a strong claim, and strong claims attract the most suspicion. The per-endorsement distrust charge is d_j = c0 + c1*(2*v_j - 1)^kappa, where the (2v-1) rescaling DAMPENS the charge near chance validity (a 55% expert's endorsement costs barely more than a coin flip's, i.e. only the flat baseline c0) while remaining steeply increasing toward confident experts. Two additions repair the incumbents' failures: (i) a large flat charge c0 preserves pure endorsement-count avoidance, so when the low-validity option carries MORE endorsements the count signal can overcome validity-distrust (the count-conflict cells where VPS is wrong); (ii) a small residual validity-weighted trust term alpha * sum_j logit(v_j)*(a_j - b_j) captures residual endorsement-following that pulls matched-count choices back toward and slightly past chance in the direction of the higher-validity endorser (softening VPS's extremes). The decision variable is D = (P(B) - P(A)) + alpha * sum_j logit(v_j)*(a_j - b_j), where P(X) = sum_j x_j*d_j is the accumulated suspicion for option X; the subject chooses via P(A) = sigmoid(beta*D) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. History is ignored because validities are communicated in the instructions, so distrust weights are fixed for the whole block. DCD nests VPS as a limiting case (alpha -> 0, rescaling absorbed) and SDI as another (c1 -> 0), while filling the empirically human region between them.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.257)

**Description**
Skeptical Defect Integration (SDI). Subjects do not treat an expert's positive rating ('1') as an asset; they treat it as a liability — an endorsement from a fallible expert is noise-laden, adverse evidence. On each trial the decision maker computes a penalty for each option, P(X) = sum_j d_j * x_j, where d_j = (1 - v_j)^delta is the skepticism weight attached to expert j (delta = 0 recovers pure unweighted defect counting — every endorsement is one unit of suspicion; larger delta discounts endorsements from low-validity experts more steeply, since a bad expert's praise is especially untrustworthy). The subject chooses the option with the LOWER total penalty, i.e., the option that attracted less endorsement. Choice probability is P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. Exact penalty ties are broken by a weak validity-weighted endorsement term alpha * sum_j logit(v_j) * (a_j - b_j), which captures residual heterogeneity: as alpha grows, SDI smoothly recovers VWEI-like endorsement-following behavior. The empirically human region sits at delta near 0 (near-pure defect counting) with moderate noise. SDI is the only account in this domain that reproduces the SIGN of every observed metric: it follows the TTB winner whenever the tally winner carries a larger endorsing coalition (Exp 1 metric positive), follows the tally loser / top-cue favorite when the tally winner has more endorsements (Exp 2 metric negative), prefers the option with fewer endorsements even when a dominant high-validity cue endorses the rival (Exp 3 metric strongly negative, HIGH minus LOW), and produces a negative signed-evidence slope because P(choose TTB winner) DECREASES as validity-weighted evidence accumulates behind the more-endorsed option (Exp 4). It makes a novel falsifiable prediction: on designs where the high-validity option carries MORE positive ratings than the low-validity option, SDI predicts majority choices OPPOSITE to both TTB and VWEI.

    Two trial classes:
      HIGH  : Erel >  3   -> pairs 1-4, where the 90% expert decides
             and VWEI strongly agrees (P(pick TTB winner) ~ 0.85).
      LOW   : Erel < -0.5 -> pairs 7-12 and 15-16, where cue 2 (or 3)
             decides but the weighted evidence of the opposing
             coalition dominates (P(pick TTB winner) ~ 0.35-0.47).

    Metric = P(choose TTB winner | HIGH) - P(choose TTB winner | LOW).

    TTB predicts the SAME choice probability on every non-tied pair
    (its score is binary), so this difference is 0 in expectation.
    VWEI predicts a large positive difference (~ +0.42). The contrast
    cancels each subject's overall response rate (beta / epsilon),
    leaving only the stimulus-driven validity sensitivity.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # "Validity-following rate in theory-conflict cells"
    #
    # The 15 experts split into a HIGH-validity group (features 0-6:
    # validities 0.95, 0.90, 0.90, 0.90, 0.85, 0.80, 0.65) and a
    # LOW-validity group (features 7-14: validity 0.60). Every trial in
    # this design pits a "pure high" option against a "pure low"
    # option. Two families of cells separate SDI from VPS:
    #
    # Family 1 (matched endorsement counts, validity gap): SDI's
    #   penalty is a near-flat function of validity (delta ~ 0), so it
    #   is pinned at ~0.51 for the high-validity option (its weak
    #   alpha tie-break even pushes slightly ABOVE 0.5). VPS's
    #   penalty rises steeply in validity, so it systematically picks
    #   the LOW-validity option (~0.28).
    #
    # Family 2 (count conflict where the FEWER-endorsed option is the
    #   high-validity one): SDI follows the endorsement count and
    #   picks the high-validity option (~0.72). VPS's validity-scaled
    #   distrust makes the low-validity majority cheaper, so it picks
    #   the high-validity option only ~0.30 of the time.
    #
    # The metric is the average of P(choose the high-validity-group
    #   option) over these two families. SDI predicts ~0.62; VPS
    #   predicts ~0.29.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # COIN-FLIP ENDORSEMENT TOLERANCE.
    #
    # For every trial, count how many endorsements each option receives
    # from the five chance-validity (v = 0.50) experts (feature indices
    # 15-19 in this experiment's fixed validity vector). Every one of the
    # 24 unique pairs pits an option carrying coin-flip endorsements
    # against an option carrying none, so the trial is scored:
    #   1.0  if the subject chose the option with MORE 0.50-expert
    #        endorsements (the 'coin-flip tolerant' choice),
    #   0.0  otherwise.
    # The metric is the mean of this score over all trials.
    #
    # This is a direct assay of the one structural difference between the
    # two confidence-distrust theories: the geometry of the per-endorsement
    # distrust charge. VPS charges c0 + c1*v^kappa, so a 0.50 endorsement
    # still costs a substantial c1*0.25-0.33 distrust units and the
    # internal exchange rate between mid-validity (0.75) endorsements and
    # coin-flips is ~1.9 coin-flips per 0.75. DCD charges
    # c0 + c1*(2v-1)^kappa, which collapses to the bare floor c0 at
    # v = 0.50 (and refunds part of the 0.75 charge via the residual trust
    # term), yielding an exchange rate of only ~1.3. Hence VPS subjects
    # are systematically MORE willing to accept coin-flip endorsements,
    # across every cell family in the design:
    #   composition cells (mixed {v_hi, 0.50} vs homogeneous mid): VPS
    #     picks the mixed side (0.53-0.59), DCD avoids it (0.33-0.45);
    #   exchange cells (0.75-coalition vs k coin-flips): VPS keeps
    #     choosing the coin-flip side through k=3-4, DCD abandons it;
    #   calibration cells ({0.90} vs {0.50}, {0.50,0.50} vs {0.90,0.90}):
    #     VPS 0.73/0.86 vs DCD 0.65/0.76.
    # Mid-parameter predictions: VPS ~0.59, DCD ~0.45 (disjoint across
    # their full parameter boxes), with per-subject SD ~0.05-0.06 from
    # 96 Bernoulli trials.

    # cells pairs 3, 4 and their mirrors 15, 16 (16 trials per subject).

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL
Propose a new model instance for the theory above from scratch. Keep the theory's prose claim implicit but unchanged — your only job is to regenerate `predict`, `policy`, and the `parameters` ranges so that the implementation actually displays the behavior the theory claims, while faithfully implementing the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed.

  "rationale": "This regeneration keeps the GDRD-B mechanism (dual-route distrust + graded counting + bimodal route-weight population via a single uniform quantile u_pop) intact and implements the arbiter's three recalibrations, targeting the one dominant error in the previous instantiation (Exp 13 ceiling prevalence: 0.52 vs observed 0.28) plus the systematically underestimated between-subject variances.\n\n(1) LAPSE RECALIBRATION. Skeptic-majority epsilon is raised from [0.08, 0.18] to [0.14, 0.28] (mean ~0.21) and counter-minority epsilon from [0.05, 0.10] to [0.10, 0.20]. On Exp 13's saturation cells both routes agree, so per-subject accuracy is 1 - eps/2 in [0.86, 0.95]; with ~24 saturation trials per subject, the analytic probability of a subject's empirical rate reaching >= 0.95 averages ~0.28 for skeptics and ~0.45 for the low-lapse counter mode, giving a pooled ceiling prevalence of ~0.28-0.31 — matching the observed 0.28 instead of 0.52. The higher lapse also pulls several slightly-overshooting mean fits toward the data (Exp 1: 0.767 -> ~0.74 vs 0.712; Exp 3: -0.595 -> ~-0.54 vs -0.547; Exp 5: 0.083 -> ~0.12 vs 0.114; Exp 10: 0.561 -> ~0.556 vs 0.510).\n\n(2) DISPERSION AMPLIFICATION. Counter-mode fraction 0.12 -> 0.17; skeptic w range widened to [0.80, 0.95], counter w range to [0.45, 0.62]; a new independent per-subject within-mode perturbation w_jitter in [-0.05, 0.05] is added and clipped to [0.40, 0.96]. E[w] stays ~0.82, so the excellent mean-level fits on Exps 3-11 are preserved, while the between-subject spread of every route-weighted statistic (saturation compliance (1-eps)*w + eps/2, conflict rates (1-eps)(1-w) + eps/2, matched-count mixtures) grows several-fold — directly attacking the 3-10x variance shortfalls on Exps 1, 3, 6, 8, 10-14.\n\n(3) EXP 14 v-METRIC PRESERVED. With the new mapping, skeptic conflict rates x = (1-eps)(1-w) + eps/2 cluster tightly around 0.11-0.28 (near the 0.21 reference, so their (x-0.21)^2 contribution stays small and is cancelled by their (r-0.96)^2 lapse shortfall), while the 17% counter mode sits at x in [0.40, 0.55], contributing (x-0.21)^2 of ~0.04-0.11 against a near-ceiling asymptote r = 1 - eps/2 in [0.90, 0.95]. The predicted RMS(v) is ~0.11-0.12, essentially the observed 0.1152 (previous value 0.1117), now with a larger counter mode reinforcing it.\n\n(4) UNCHANGED CORE. (c0, c1, kappa, beta, alpha) keep their previous ranges — the matched-count validity-reversal and signed-evidence-slope assays (Exps 4, 8, 9, 10) were already well captured and the distrust-charge geometry is not implicated in any failure. The residual costs are small, bounded regressions on the saturated conflict assays (Exp 11 ~0.75 vs 0.79, Exp 12 ~0.79 vs 0.83, Exp 8 ~0.76 vs 0.78) — a net win of roughly 0.2 in pooled point-estimate error once the 0.24 Exp-13 error is removed, before counting the variance improvements."
