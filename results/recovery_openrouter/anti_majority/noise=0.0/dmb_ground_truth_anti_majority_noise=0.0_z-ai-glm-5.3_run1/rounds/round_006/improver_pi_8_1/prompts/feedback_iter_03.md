# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_8`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_8`).

Keep the GDRD-B description (dual-route distrust with graded counting and bimodal route-weight population) intact; regenerate the parameter ranges and population mapping as follows. (1) LAPSE RECALIBRATION (fixes Exp 1): raise the skeptic-majority epsilon range from [0.08, 0.18] to approximately [0.14, 0.28] (mean ~0.21) and the counter-minority epsilon range from [0.05, 0.10] to approximately [0.10, 0.20]. Verify against Exp 1's ceiling-prevalence metric: per-subject saturation accuracy should now fall in ~[0.86, 0.95], yielding a pooled ceiling prevalence near the observed 0.28 rather than 0.52, while the conflict-compliance assays (Exps 13/14, observed 0.7875/0.8320) remain matched since (1-eps)*w + eps/2 is only mildly sensitive in this regime. (2) DISPERSION AMPLIFICATION (fixes the systematically underestimated between-subject variances): increase the counter-mode fraction from 0.12 to ~0.15-0.20, widen the skeptic w range to [0.80, 0.95] and the counter w range to [0.45, 0.62], and add modest within-mode jitter in w (e.g., the quantile-transform value plus a small independent per-subject perturbation) so the population variance on the saturation/conflict assays grows 2-4x while E[w] stays ~0.84, preserving the excellent mean-level fits on Exps 3-11. (3) Verify the Exp 2 v-metric is preserved: with the higher epsilon, counters' (x-0.21)^2 term (driven by the count route, lapse-robust) should continue to dominate their (r-0.96)^2 shortfall, keeping RMS(v) near 0.10-0.12; if skeptic x drifts too close to the 0.21 reference, lower the skeptic w floor to 0.80 to restore separation. (4) Keep the graded count slope gamma in [1.5, 3.5], the capped-logit micro-trust alpha in [0, 0.05], and recalibrate (c0, c1, kappa) only as needed to preserve the matched-count validity-reversal fits (Exps 10/11: observed 0.78/0.37, both currently well captured).


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Graded Dual-Route Distrust with a Bimodal Strategy Population (GDRD-B). Subjects evaluate expert endorsements through two concurrent routes. ROUTE 1 (analytic distrust): every endorsement is a liability whose magnitude grows monotonically in the endorser's RAW claimed validity, d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa; accumulated suspicion P(X) = sum_j x_j*d_j is compared across options through sigmoid(beta*(P(B)-P(A))), plus a small residual micro-trust edge alpha*sum_j clip(logit(v_j),0,3)*(a_j-b_j) (capped so perfect experts exert bounded, not unbounded, trust pull). ROUTE 2 (graded counting): a continuous preference for the fewer-endorsement option, sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B-cnt_A)). The population is BIMODAL in the route weight w: a large majority (~88%) of 'skeptics' (w in [0.85, 0.95], moderate lapse) coexists with a minority (~12%) of 'counters' (w in [0.50, 0.62], low lapse, decisive count slope gamma >= 2). The mixture is implemented as a quantile transform of a single uniform per-subject population variable u_pop, which holds the population-MEAN route weight at its base value while exploding the between-subject behavioral variance — the empirically observed 3-12x super-binomial variance on the saturation assays (Exps 11, 12) that no uniform range-widening could reproduce.

    #
    # NEUTRALITY COUPLING (replaces the failed within-mode jitters and
    # the failed skeptic-w-floor lowering): a skeptic's Exp-14 excess-
    # dispersion contribution is v = (x-0.21)^2 - (r-0.96)^2 with
    # x = (1-eps)(1-w) + eps/2 and r = 1 - eps/2. Setting x - 0.21 =
    # (r - 0.96) gives exactly (1-eps)(1-w) = 0.25 - eps, i.e.
    # w = 1 - (0.25 - eps)/(1 - eps). Tying w to eps along this curve
    # makes every skeptic's v approximately ZERO at ANY lapse level, so
    # the skeptic epsilon can be raised into [0.18, 0.27] to fix the
    # Exp-13 ceiling prevalence (per-subject saturation accuracy
    # 1 - eps/2 in [0.865, 0.91] -> pooled ceiling prevalence ~0.28-0.30)
    # WITHOUT collapsing the Exp-14 v-statistic the way the iter-2
    # uncoupled raise did. E[w] stays ~0.93-0.94, preserving the
    # distrust-dominant means on Exps 8, 9, 11, 12 that the iter-3

`rationale`:
This is a minimal-diff edit of the accepted iter-1 base that implements the critic's iter-3 prescription while explicitly avoiding the two levers the gate validated as harmful (the skeptic w-floor lowering and the large within-mode jitters, both retracted by the critic).

(1) RECONSTRUCT THE VALIDATED ITER-2 CORE. f_counter 0.17 -> 0.13, counter w -> [0.45, 0.62] with counter eps [0.12, 0.22] and gamma [2.0, 3.5] (gamma >= 2 keeps the prose's 'decisive count slope'), and beta reverted to [1.3, 2.4] (the iter-3 beta revert demonstrably repaired Exps 3 and 10). These settings empirically delivered Exp 6 = 0.209 (obs 0.1925), Exp 12 = 0.811 (obs 0.832), Exp 3 = -0.525 (obs -0.547), Exp 10 = 0.546 — the best values seen on those assays.

(2) REMOVE THE FAILED JITTERS. The +/-0.05/0.08/0.12 jitters failed twice: they contaminate Exp 6 (jitter-blurred skeptics act counter-like on gap/coalition cells) and Exp 13 (the eps-jitter floor re-creates ceiling subjects), while leaving every between-subject variance metric essentially unmoved (the metric-relevant quantities are compressed functions of (w, eps)). Only a tiny w_spread +/-0.02 around the skeptic neutrality curve survives.

(3) FIX THE EXP-13-vs-EXP-14 TENSION WITH THE NEUTRALITY COUPLING, not with the w floor. Raising skeptic eps fixes Exp 13 (per-subject saturation accuracy 1 - eps/2 in [0.865, 0.91] gives pooled ceiling prevalence ~0.28-0.30 vs the observed 0.28, versus the base's 0.40), but an uncoupled raise collapsed Exp 14 to 0.0 in iter-2 because x = (1-eps)(1-w) + eps/2 slid onto the 0.21 reference while (r-0.96)^2 grew. Tying w to eps along w = 1 - (0.25-eps)/(1-eps) (clipped to the prose band [0.85, 0.95]) makes every skeptic's v = (x-0.21)^2 - (r-0.96)^2 approximately zero at any lapse level: at eps=0.18, w=0.91 -> x=0.156, r=0.910, v ~ +0.0004; at eps=0.25, w=0.95 -> v ~ -0.003. The 13% counter mode (x ~ 0.45-0.55, near-ceiling r) then carries E[v] > 0, keeping Exp 14 in the 0.05-0.09 band instead of clipping to zero. Crucially E[w] stays ~0.93-0.94 — the distrust-dominant means the iter-3 w-floor lowering destroyed (Exps 8, 11, 12) are preserved: projected Exp 8 ~ 0.78 (obs 0.781), Exp 11 ~ 0.80 (obs 0.788), Exp 12 ~ 0.815 (obs 0.832), Exp 9 ~ 0.38 (obs 0.373).

(4) VARIANCE: per the critic's retraction, I stop chasing the 3-6x between-subject shortfalls with within-skeptic heterogeneity — two failed attempts show the derived behavioral quantities are too compressed for that lever, and the residual shortfall is shared by every theory in the reference set. The only retained variance lever is the slightly widened counter mode (w down to 0.45, gamma to 3.5), which enlarges between-mode dispersion without touching the majority that sets every mean.

(5) UNCHANGED CORE. (c0, c1, kappa, alpha) keep their ranges — the distrust-charge geometry is not implicated in any failure, and the c0 exchange-rate lever trades Exp 10 against Exp 1 in opposite directions, so it is left alone. Net projected movement versus the accepted base: Exp 13 error +0.12 -> ~+0.02, Exp 6 +0.065 -> ~+0.01, Exp 12 -0.055 -> ~-0.02, Exp 1 +0.052 -> ~+0.03, Exp 9 +0.031 -> ~+0.01, Exp 11 -0.024 -> ~+0.01, with Exps 2, 4, 5, 7 essentially unchanged and Exp 14 held near its base value (~0.08 vs 0.084) by the coupling. That is a large net reduction in pooled point-estimate error at essentially no variance cost, which should clear the 0.0602 accept-gate floor.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0602 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0632 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0736 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0545 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.0545.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # "Validity-following rate in theory-conflict cells"
    #
    # The 15 experts split into a HIGH-validity group (features 0-6:
    # validities 0.95, 0.90, 0.90, 0.90, 0.85, 0.80, 0.65) and a
    # LOW-validity group (features 7-14: validity 0.60). Every trial in
    # this design pits a "pure high" option against a "pure low"
    # option. Two families of cells separate SDI from VPS:
    #
    # Family 1 (matched endorsement counts, validity gap): SDI's
    #   penalty is a near-flat function of validity (delta ~ 0), so it
    #   is pinned at ~0.51 for the high-validity option (its weak
    #   alpha tie-break even pushes slightly ABOVE 0.5). VPS's
    #   penalty rises steeply in validity, so it systematically picks
    #   the LOW-validity option (~0.28).
    #
    # Family 2 (count conflict where the FEWER-endorsed option is the
    #   high-validity one): SDI follows the endorsement count and
    #   picks the high-validity option (~0.72). VPS's validity-scaled
    #   distrust makes the low-validity majority cheaper, so it picks
    #   the high-validity option only ~0.30 of the time.
    #
    # The metric is the average of P(choose the high-validity-group
    #   option) over these two families. SDI predicts ~0.62; VPS
    #   predicts ~0.29.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # COIN-FLIP ENDORSEMENT TOLERANCE.
    #
    # For every trial, count how many endorsements each option receives
    # from the five chance-validity (v = 0.50) experts (feature indices
    # 15-19 in this experiment's fixed validity vector). Every one of the
    # 24 unique pairs pits an option carrying coin-flip endorsements
    # against an option carrying none, so the trial is scored:
    #   1.0  if the subject chose the option with MORE 0.50-expert
    #        endorsements (the 'coin-flip tolerant' choice),
    #   0.0  otherwise.
    # The metric is the mean of this score over all trials.
    #
    # This is a direct assay of the one structural difference between the
    # two confidence-distrust theories: the geometry of the per-endorsement
    # distrust charge. VPS charges c0 + c1*v^kappa, so a 0.50 endorsement
    # still costs a substantial c1*0.25-0.33 distrust units and the
    # internal exchange rate between mid-validity (0.75) endorsements and
    # coin-flips is ~1.9 coin-flips per 0.75. DCD charges
    # c0 + c1*(2v-1)^kappa, which collapses to the bare floor c0 at
    # v = 0.50 (and refunds part of the 0.75 charge via the residual trust
    # term), yielding an exchange rate of only ~1.3. Hence VPS subjects
    # are systematically MORE willing to accept coin-flip endorsements,
    # across every cell family in the design:
    #   composition cells (mixed {v_hi, 0.50} vs homogeneous mid): VPS
    #     picks the mixed side (0.53-0.59), DCD avoids it (0.33-0.45);
    #   exchange cells (0.75-coalition vs k coin-flips): VPS keeps
    #     choosing the coin-flip side through k=3-4, DCD abandons it;
    #   calibration cells ({0.90} vs {0.50}, {0.50,0.50} vs {0.90,0.90}):
    #     VPS 0.73/0.86 vs DCD 0.65/0.76.
    # Mid-parameter predictions: VPS ~0.59, DCD ~0.45 (disjoint across
    # their full parameter boxes), with per-subject SD ~0.05-0.06 from
    # 96 Bernoulli trials.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the arbiter's prescribed GDRD-B family and its three recalibrations, and the mean-level fits remain strong: Exps 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 are all within ~0.02-0.03 of the observed values, and the distrust-charge geometry (c0, c1, kappa, beta, alpha) is clearly doing real work across experiments. The gate accepted it, and correctly so — it beats the previous instantiation. But three systematic residuals remain, and they are exactly the ones the arbiter flagged: (1) Exp 13 ceiling prevalence improved from 0.52 to only 0.40 vs observed 0.28 — the rationale's analytic estimate (~0.28-0.31) was optimistic because the per-subject saturation trial count is small, so an empirical rate >= 0.95 is much easier to hit than the 24-trial binomial calculation assumed; the epsilon raise was undersized. (2) Exp 14's v-metric REGRESSED from 0.1117 (previous) to 0.0843 vs observed 0.1152: the higher skeptic epsilon pushed skeptic conflict rates x = (1-eps)(1-w) + eps/2 toward the 0.21 reference (cancelling their (x-0.21)^2 term) while increasing their (r-0.96)^2 asymptote shortfall — the arbiter anticipated this failure mode. (3) The dispersion amplification did NOT deliver: between-subject variances are still 3-6x short almost everywhere (Exp 1: 0.0031 vs 0.0205; Exp 3: 0.0116 vs 0.0421; Exp 7: 0.0043 vs 0.0238; Exp 9: 0.0040 vs 0.0159; Exp 10: 0.0025 vs 0.0121; Exp 11: 0.0183 vs 0.0537 — the last actually WORSE than the previous candidate's 0.0289; Exp 12: 0.0121 vs 0.0438). The structural cause is that (w, epsilon, gamma) are all deterministic functions of a single uniform u_pop plus a tiny w_jitter (±0.05): the population is effectively one-dimensional, which caps per-metric between-subject variance far below what the data show (e.g., Exp 11's var=0.0537 implies subjects spread from ~0.3 to ~1.0). Additionally, raising the counter fraction to 0.17 caused two mean-level regressions: Exp 6 (0.2575 vs observed 0.1925; the previous 0.12-fraction instantiation got 0.2050 — counters are near-blind on the matched-count gap cells and drag the composite up) and Exp 12 (0.7775 vs 0.8320 — counters pick the fewer-endorsement perfect-heavy side, dragging the coin-side rate down).
Rationale: verdict=regenerate

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0602 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0632 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The gate REJECTED this candidate (loss 0.0632 vs the accepted 0.0602), and the per-experiment breakdown shows a sharply bimodal outcome: the three targeted fixes mostly landed, but one change caused a catastrophic regression that dominates the loss. WHAT WORKED: (i) Exp 13 ceiling prevalence is now essentially solved — 0.2600 vs observed 0.2800 (was 0.4000); the round-2 epsilon raise to [0.19, 0.31] was correctly sized. (ii) Exp 6 recovered to 0.2087 vs 0.1925 (was 0.2575) — trimming the counter fraction to 0.13 worked exactly as intended. (iii) Exp 12 improved to 0.8110 vs 0.8320 (was 0.7775). (iv) Exp 1 improved to 0.7503 (was 0.7639), Exp 2 remains essentially perfect (-0.2572 vs -0.2562). WHAT FAILED: (1) EXP 14 COLLAPSED TO 0.0000 (observed 0.1152; iter 1 had 0.0843). This is the single worst possible outcome for that metric — mean(v) went non-positive for the entire population. The mechanism is identifiable: the proposer RAISED the skeptic w range to [0.86, 0.98], which is the exact OPPOSITE of the arbiter's explicit contingency instruction ('if skeptic x drifts too close to the 0.21 reference, lower the skeptic w floor to 0.80 to restore separation'). With w in [0.86, 0.98] and eps in [0.19, 0.31], skeptic conflict rates x = (1-eps)(1-w) + eps/2 land in ~[0.11, 0.27], hugging the 0.21 reference and annihilating the (x-0.21)^2 term, while the same epsilon drives r = 1 - eps/2 down to ~0.85-0.90, inflating (r-0.96)^2 to ~0.005-0.013 per skeptic. The 13% counter mode at w in [0.42, 0.56] contributes positive v, but not enough to offset 87% of skeptics at negative v, so the RMS clips to zero. This is a faithfulness violation against the arbiter recommendation, not a family drift — the GDRD-B structure itself is intact. (2) THE DISPERSION AMPLIFICATION STILL DID NOT DELIVER: the 2D jitter (w ±0.08, eps ±0.05) left between-subject variances 3-6x short essentially everywhere (Exp 1: 0.0034 vs 0.0205; Exp 3: 0.0163 vs 0.0421; Exp 7: 0.0055 vs 0.0238; Exp 9: 0.0027 vs 0.0159; Exp 10: 0.0037 vs 0.0121; Exp 11: 0.0150 vs 0.0537; Exp 12: 0.0087 vs 0.0438; Exp 13: 0.0036 vs 0.0133). The jitters are simply too small: the observed Exp 11 variance (0.0537) implies skeptic conflict compliance spreading from ~0.3 to ~1.0 across subjects, which requires much wider w (and/or eps) heterogeneity within the skeptic mode than [0.86, 0.98] ± 0.08. (3) TWO MEAN-LEVEL REGRESSIONS from the compensating changes: Exp 3 worsened to -0.4975 vs -0.5467 (was -0.5075) and Exp 10 worsened to 0.5594 vs 0.5096 (was 0.5415) — both coincide with the beta raise to [1.5, 2.8] and the higher lapse compressing the assays. Net: the epsilon recalibration and counter-fraction trim are validated; the skeptic-w raise, the undersized jitters, and the beta raise are the failures.
Rationale: verdict=regenerate. The candidate was rejected by the gate, so the next iteration builds on the iter-1 base; the new direction should KEEP the validated pieces and reverse the specific errors. Concretely: (A) KEEP the round-2 lapse calibration (skeptic eps [0.19, 0.31], counter eps [0.12, 0.22]) — it delivered Exp 13 = 0.26 vs 0.28 — and KEEP f_counter = 0.13 with counter w in [0.42, 0.56] — it delivered Exp 6 = 0.209 and Exp 12 = 0.811. Do not re-trim these; they are no longer the binding residuals. (B) REVERSE the skeptic w raise: restore the arbiter's contingency by LOWERING the skeptic w floor to ~0.78-0.82 (range approximately [0.79, 0.95]) instead of [0.86, 0.98]. This is the single highest-leverage change: it moves skeptic conflict x = (1-eps)(1-w) + eps/2 from ~0.21 out to ~0.26-0.30, restoring the (x-0.21)^2 term on Exp 14; it widens the skeptic compliance spread ((1-eps)w + eps/2 now spans roughly [0.65, 0.90] before jitter), directly attacking the 3-6x variance shortfalls on Exps 11/12/14; and it should pull the Exp 1 mean (currently +0.039 too high) toward 0.71 via the stronger count-route contribution. Monitor Exp 11's mean (0.7662 vs 0.7875) — if it drops below ~0.75, skew the skeptic eps distribution toward its lower half rather than raising w back. (C) ENLARGE the within-mode heterogeneity substantially: the ±0.08/±0.05 jitters demonstrably failed to move any variance metric; widen to w_jitter ±0.10-0.12 and eps_jitter ±0.10-0.12 (keeping the clips), so that lapse and route weight vary near-independently over most of each mode's width. The variance targets (Exp 11 var 0.0537, Exp 12 var 0.0438) cannot be met with the current compressed skeptic mode. (D) REVERT beta toward [1.3, 2.4]: the raise to [1.5, 2.8] coincided with the Exp 3 (-0.4975 vs -0.5467) and Exp 10 (0.5594 vs 0.5096) regressions; with the lower skeptic w from (B) restoring route sharpness on the distrust assays, the steeper sigmoid is no longer needed and is actively hurting the two most beta-sensitive means. If Exp 10 remains too high after these changes, nudge c0 upward slightly (e.g., [0.08, 0.16]) to reduce coin-flip tolerance. (E) VERIFY Exp 14 end-to-end this time: after (B)+(C), the counter mode (x ~ 0.45-0.60, r ~ 0.89-0.94) and the widened skeptic x spread should jointly push RMS(v) back toward the 0.10-0.12 band; if it still clips near zero, the culprit is the skeptic (r-0.96)^2 shortfall from eps up to 0.31 — in that case trim only the skeptic eps CEILING to ~0.28 (Exp 13's prevalence is a threshold statistic and is insensitive to the ceiling at the current mean). The GDRD-B family itself is faithfully implemented and should not be redesigned; every fix above is an in-family parameter/population-mapping adjustment.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0632 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0736 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The gate REJECTED this candidate (loss 0.0736 vs the accepted iter-1 base at 0.0602), and it is the worst-scoring instantiation of the loop so far. The proposer faithfully followed my iter-2 prescription — lowered the skeptic w floor to 0.79, enlarged both jitters to ±0.12, reverted beta, trimmed the eps ceiling — and the outcome is instructive: the pieces I flagged as fixes for Exp 14 and the variances either under-delivered or actively broke the mean-level assays that were previously excellent. Concretely: (1) THE W-FLOOR LOWERING BROKE EVERY DISTRUST-DOMINANT MEAN. Lowering the skeptic mode to [0.79, 0.95] plus a ±0.12 jitter clipped at 0.55 dropped the effective E[w] to ~0.83, handing the count route extra weight everywhere it is indifferent or opposed: Exp 8 fell to 0.7183 (obs 0.7808; iter 2 had 0.7596) because the count route is indifferent at matched counts and pulls toward 0.5; Exp 9 rose to 0.4240 (obs 0.3729) by the same pull; Exp 11 fell to 0.7175 (obs 0.7875) because the count route votes against the skeptic side on saturated conflict cells; Exp 12 fell to 0.7830 (obs 0.8320) because the count route prefers the fewer-endorsement perfect-heavy side, i.e. votes against the coin side. (2) THE ENLARGED JITTERS WERE A DEAD LEVER — AGAIN. Despite w spanning ~[0.67, 0.96] and eps ~[0.07, 0.35] across subjects, the between-subject variances did not move (Exp 11 var 0.0139 vs 0.0537; Exp 12 var 0.0077 vs 0.0438; Exp 1 var 0.0035 vs 0.0205). The reason is structural: the metric-relevant quantities (e.g. Exp 11 compliance (1-eps)w + eps/2) are compressed functions of (w, eps), so even this much parameter heterogeneity yields only ~0.013 population variance; the observed ~0.05 (which already includes ~0.01 of per-subject binomial noise on 16-40 trials) is not reachable in this family without destroying the means — and no reference theory reaches it either (pi_8: 0.0289/0.0089). Meanwhile the jitter's low eps clip (0.05) re-created low-lapse subjects, regressing Exp 13's ceiling prevalence back to 0.3600 (obs 0.2800; iter 2 had solved it at 0.2600), and the jitter-blurred skeptics behave partially counter-like on Exp 6's gap/coalition cells, regressing it to 0.2638 (obs 0.1925; iter 2 had 0.2087). (3) WHAT DID WORK: Exp 14 recovered from 0.0000 to 0.0659 (obs 0.1152) — the (x-0.21)^2 term is partially restored — and the beta revert to [1.3, 2.4] fixed the iter-2 regressions on Exp 3 (-0.5246 vs -0.5467, was -0.4975) and Exp 10 (0.5456, was 0.5594), while Exp 1 improved to 0.7394 (obs 0.7117). The lesson from three iterations is now clear: the skeptic mode must stay HIGH-w and clean (no large within-mode jitter), the counter mode must stay at f_counter ≈ 0.13 with w in [0.42, 0.56], and Exp 14 must be fixed not by lowering w but by a targeted correlation between w and eps inside the skeptic mode.
Rationale: verdict=regenerate. The candidate was rejected by the gate, so the next iteration rebuilds on the iter-1 base; my iter-2 items (B) 'lower the skeptic w floor' and (C) 'enlarge the within-mode jitters' were validated as harmful by the gate and must NOT be repeated — I explicitly retract them. The new direction: (A) RECONSTRUCT the population from the validated iter-2 core: skeptic eps in [0.19, 0.28], f_counter = 0.13, counter w in [0.42, 0.56] with counter eps in [0.12, 0.22], beta in [1.3, 2.4] (the beta revert demonstrably fixed Exps 3 and 10). (B) REMOVE the within-mode jitters entirely (or shrink to ±0.03): they have now failed twice — they contaminate Exp 6 (jitter-blurred skeptics act counter-like on the gap/coalition cells) and Exp 13 (the eps_jitter's 0.05 floor re-creates ceiling subjects) while adding almost nothing to any variance metric. (C) FIX EXP 14 BY CORRELATING (w, eps) WITHIN THE SKEPTIC MODE ALONG ITS NEUTRALITY CURVE, NOT BY LOWERING w. The arithmetic: a skeptic's v = (x-0.21)^2 - (r-0.96)^2 with x = (1-eps)(1-w) + eps/2 and r = 1 - eps/2. Setting these equal on the high-w branch gives (1-eps)(1-w) = 0.25 - eps, i.e. w = 1 - (0.25 - eps)/(1-eps): eps = 0.15 -> w = 0.88, eps = 0.20 -> w = 0.94, eps = 0.24 -> w = 0.97. So a skeptic mode with eps in ~[0.15, 0.24] and w tied to eps by this relation (plus a tiny ±0.02 spread, clipped at ~0.97) makes every skeptic's v approximately zero, letting the 13% counter mode (x ~ 0.45-0.60, r ~ 0.90, v ~ +0.08) carry the population E[v] to ~0.011, i.e. RMS(v) ~ 0.10-0.11 against the observed 0.1152 — while KEEPING E[w] ~ 0.92-0.94, which is exactly what Exps 8, 9, 11, and 12 need (they all regressed in iter 3 purely because E[w] fell). This resolves the iter-2-vs-iter-3 oscillation on the skeptic w floor by refusing the one-dimensional knob and using the second dimension (the w-eps coupling) instead. (D) VERIFY EXP 13 EMPIRICALLY after the eps range shift to [0.15, 0.24] (mean ~0.20 vs iter 2's 0.25): prevalence is a threshold statistic driven by the low-eps tail, so if it falls below ~0.22, shift the range to [0.17, 0.26] and re-solve the neutrality pairing accordingly (the relation in (C) degrades gracefully for eps up to 0.25). (E) ON VARIANCE: stop chasing the 3-6x between-subject shortfalls with within-skeptic heterogeneity — two failed attempts show the derived behavioral quantities are too compressed for that lever. The only in-family variance lever that does not move the skeptic means is widening the COUNTER mode's separation: extend counter w down to [0.40, 0.62] and let gamma span its full [1.5, 3.5] range, which enlarges between-mode dispersion on Exps 11/12/14 without touching the majority that sets every mean. Accept that the residual variance shortfall is shared by every theory in the reference set and that the aggregate loss is dominated by the means. The GDRD-B family itself remains faithfully implemented and well-supported (Exps 2, 4, 5, 7 are essentially exact); every change above is an in-family population-mapping recalibration.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0736 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0545 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

  "interpretation": "The gate ACCEPTED this candidate (loss 0.0545, the best of the loop), and my iter-3 prescription is validated: the neutrality coupling did exactly what the arithmetic predicted. Exp 14 recovered to 0.0939 vs observed 0.1152 (was 0.0000 in iter 2, 0.0843 in iter 1) \u2014 the (x-0.21)^2 term is preserved at any lapse level while E[w] stays ~0.93, and the counter mode carries E[v] > 0. The distrust-dominant means held: Exp 11 = 0.7812 vs 0.7875 (essentially exact, best of the loop), Exp 12 = 0.8090 vs 0.8320, Exp 8 = 0.7454 vs 0.7808, Exp 4 = -0.1941 vs -0.1938 (exact), Exp 2 and Exp 7 remain close, and Exp 1 improved again to 0.7278 vs 0.7117. Removing the jitters was also correct \u2014 no variance metric moved in iters 2-3 anyway, and the mean assays stopped being contaminated. However, three systematic residuals remain, and two of them share a single identifiable cause: (1) EXP 3 REGRESSED TO -0.4558 vs observed -0.5467 (iter 1: -0.5075, iter 3: -0.5246). The metric is a difference of two choice probabilities, and the skeptic epsilon raise to [0.18, 0.27] (mean ~0.225, vs ~0.13 in iter 1) compresses both toward 0.5 by a factor (1-eps), shrinking the contrast. This is a clean lapse-compression signature, not a geometry problem. (2) EXP 13 UNDERSHOOTS: 0.2200 vs observed 0.2800 \u2014 the coupling's epsilon is now slightly too high on average, producing too few ceiling subjects (iter 2's eps mean ~0.25 gave 0.26; the current 0.225 with the w-coupling gives 0.22). Both residuals point the same direction: lower the skeptic epsilon. (3) EXP 6 is elevated at 0.2475 vs 0.1925 \u2014 the only substantive change from iter 2's validated 0.2087 on this assay is the counter w range drifting from [0.42, 0.56] to [0.45, 0.62]; the higher-w counters are less count-decisive on the gap/coalition cells. The remaining residuals (Exp 9 +0.039, Exp 10 +0.038, Exp 5 +0.028) have been stable across all four iterations regardless of epsilon, w, or beta settings \u2014 they are persistent but small and not worth risking the validated core for. Between-subject variances remain 3-6x short everywhere, but as established over iters 2-3, the metric-relevant quantities are too compressed functions of (w, eps) for any in-family heterogeneity lever to close that gap without destroying the means, and no reference theory reaches it either (pi_8: 0.0289/0.0089 on Exps 11/12).",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "verdict=regenerate, but only as a final minimal-diff tuning pass on the accepted iter-4 base \u2014 the structure is correct and every change below is an in-family parameter recalibration of the validated neutrality-coupled population. (A) LOWER THE SKEPTIC EPSILON RANGE from [0.18, 0.27] to approximately [0.15, 0.23] (mean ~0.19), re-solving the neutrality pairing w = 1 - (0.25 - eps)/(1 - eps) over the new range (eps = 0.15 -> w ~ 0.88; eps = 0.23 -> w ~ 0.97, clipped at 0.95 \u2014 the clip only makes skeptic v slightly positive, which is the safe direction for Exp 14). This single change attacks the two largest residuals simultaneously: it decompresses the Exp 3 contrast back toward -0.50 to -0.52, and it raises the Exp 13 ceiling prevalence back toward the observed 0.28 (iter 2 demonstrated the prevalence statistic responds to the eps mean in exactly this regime). Critically, the coupling makes the saturated-conflict compliance (1-eps)*w + eps/2 approximately eps-invariant along the neutrality curve (~0.82-0.83 at every point), so the excellent Exp 11/12 means are structurally protected \u2014 this is the key property that makes the eps reduction low-risk, and it should be verified numerically. (B) RESTORE THE COUNTER w RANGE to the iter-2-validated [0.42, 0.56] (from the current [0.45, 0.62]), keeping f_counter = 0.13, counter eps [0.12, 0.22], and counter gamma >= 2. This should pull Exp 6 back toward 0.21 from the current 0.2475 without touching any other assay (counters set no other mean at 13% mass). (C) CHANGE NOTHING ELSE: keep beta [1.3, 2.4], (c0, c1, kappa, alpha) ranges, the tiny +/-0.02 w_spread, and the jitter-free population \u2014 these are all now empirically validated across iterations, and the iter-2/iter-3 history shows that touching the skeptic w floor, the jitters, or beta destroys more than it gains. (D) DO NOT chase the Exp 9/10 residuals (+0.04) or the between-subject variance shortfall: both have been stable across every parameterization tried in this loop, the variance gap is shared by every reference theory, and two dedicated attempts to close it were rejected by the gate. If the eps reduction and counter-w restoration land as projected (Exp 3 error ~+0.04, Exp 13 error ~+0.02, Exp 6 error ~+0.01, everything else unchanged), the pooled loss should fall clearly below 0.0545; if any projection misses, ship the iter-4 base as-is, since it is already the strongest instantiation of the GDRD-B family this loop has produced."
