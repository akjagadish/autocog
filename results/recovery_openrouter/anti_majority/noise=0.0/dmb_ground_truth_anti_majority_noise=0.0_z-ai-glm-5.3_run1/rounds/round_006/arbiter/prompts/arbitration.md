# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_7" and "pi_8") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_7" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_8" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_7
Softened Validity-Distrust with Count Mixture (SVD). Every expert endorsement is a liability whose magnitude increases monotonically in the endorser's RAW claimed validity: d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa, with no dampening near v=0.5 and no trust refund. Decision making is a dual-process mixture at the trial level: with probability w the subject is a 'skeptic' who integrates the accumulated-suspicion difference D = P(B) - P(A) through sigmoid(beta*D); with probability (1-w) the subject is a 'counter' who simply chooses the option with FEWER total endorsements (indifferent at matched counts). Two heterogeneity mechanisms soften the pooled extremes and capture between-subject variability: (i) the sigmoid slope beta is sampled from a WIDE per-subject range, so the population is a mixture of shallow and steep sigmoids — sensitive near D=0 (matched-count validity-composition trials) yet compressed at large |D| (unequal-count trials); (ii) the uniform lapse epsilon is also sampled from a wide per-subject range, which pulls every saturated large-D assay toward 0.5 while adding genuine between-subject dispersion in overall choice rates.

## THEORY 2 — pi_8
Graded Dual-Route Distrust with a Bimodal Strategy Population (GDRD-B). Subjects evaluate expert endorsements through two concurrent routes. ROUTE 1 (analytic distrust): every endorsement is a liability whose magnitude grows monotonically in the endorser's RAW claimed validity, d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa; accumulated suspicion P(X) = sum_j x_j*d_j is compared across options through sigmoid(beta*(P(B)-P(A))), plus a small residual micro-trust edge alpha*sum_j clip(logit(v_j),0,3)*(a_j-b_j) (capped so perfect experts exert bounded, not unbounded, trust pull). ROUTE 2 (graded counting): a continuous preference for the fewer-endorsement option, sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B-cnt_A)). The population is BIMODAL in the route weight w: a large majority (~88%) of 'skeptics' (w in [0.85, 0.95], moderate lapse) coexists with a minority (~12%) of 'counters' (w in [0.50, 0.62], low lapse, decisive count slope gamma >= 2). The mixture is implemented as a quantile transform of a single uniform per-subject population variable u_pop, which holds the population-MEAN route weight at its base value while exploding the between-subject behavioral variance — the empirically observed 3-12x super-binomial variance on the saturation assays (Exps 11, 12) that no uniform range-widening could reproduce.

**Rationale:** NOVEL AXIS (vs. Exps 0-11): the first head-to-head between SVD (advocated) and GDRD-B (competing) — two theories that share the SAME distrust core (penalty c0 + c1*v^kappa, sigmoid comparison, lapse) AND, by construction, the same population-MEAN route weight (~0.86): GDRD-B's bimodal quantile transform explicitly holds E[w] at SVD's base value. A box-robust sign conflict is therefore provably impossible (the skeptic cores are near-identical and their boxes overlap), and pooled-mean gaps on any single cell are bounded at ~3 points. The dissociation must be fought on three quantitative fronts, all exploited here: (1) the SATURATION ASYMPTOTE LEVEL (a pure lapse assay: on cells where both branches saturate, P = 1 - E[eps]/2 — SVD .910 with every subject in [.874,.940]; GDRD-B .938 with NO subject below .899 and ~65% above .940); (2) a POOLED-MEAN DOUBLE CROSSING (GDRD-B is ABOVE SVD on saturated cells by its lower lapse, but BELOW SVD on single-vs-many exchange cells by its higher w and graded — not step — count route: an interaction no reparameterization can mimic, since eps and w push in opposite directions across the two families); (3) the PER-SUBJECT DISTRIBUTION (GDRD-B's 12% counter minority with w in [.50,.62] lands 8-20 points OUTSIDE SVD's box on count-conflict cells, producing the bimodality/super-binomial variance GDRD-B claims — turned here into its falsifiable liability: SVD bounds EVERY subject's conflict-cell rate >= .69 because w >= .80 and eps >= .12). VALIDITY ENGINEERING: 6 perfect experts (v=1.0) give the maximum, KAPPA-INVARIANT charge c0+c1 (closing every corner-escape route, as in Exp 11) and a capped logit (3) that bounds GDRD-B's micro-trust term at 0.15/endorsement vs a >= 0.6 per-pair charge gap — verified: saturation survives every corner of BOTH boxes including alpha=0.05; 8 coin experts (v=0.50) give the cheapest charge (c0+c1*0.5^k in [0.39,0.57]) and ZERO logit (alpha-inert); 2 experts at v=0.65 have a coin-charge ratio of 1.36-1.54 across BOTH entire boxes, making the 2-vs-3 penalty-matched cell residual |D| <= 0.14 (skeptic in [.44,.61]) by arithmetic. 8 base pairs, each exactly A/B-mirrored (16 unique pairs, K = 96//16 = 6, 96 trials, 12 samples per base cell per subject), perfectly side-balanced. Mid parameters quoted: SVD (c0=.085, c1=1.125, kappa=1.65, beta=1.9, w=.86, eps=.18); GDRD-B majority (c0=.095, c1=1.175, kappa=1.85, beta=1.9, w=.90, eps=.13, gamma=2.25, alpha=.025) and minority (w=.56, eps=.075, gamma=2.5); box ranges verified at box corners. FAMILY 1 — SATURATED CONFLICT / COUNTER-TAIL CELLS (pairs 1-2, primary): A = 8 (then 7) coin endorsements vs B = 6 (then 5) perfect endorsements. Skeptic evidence is saturated toward A at every corner of both boxes (|D| >= 2.16; SVD s_A >= .93, GDRD s_A >= .90 even after the worst alpha pull), while the count route saturates toward B (A carries MORE endorsements). SVD: P(A) = (1-eps)*w*s_A + eps/2, every subject in [.685,.870] (population ~.79). GDRD-B: skeptic majority [.72,.92], but the 12% counter minority lands in [.46,.62] — DISJOINT from SVD's box by >= 7 points on both pairs. FALSIFICATION: any subject with a pooled conflict-cell rate < .65 (24 trials) is outside SVD's entire box (w >= .80, eps >= .12, s >= .93 make it unreachable); conversely, ZERO such subjects in N >= 40 (P = .88^40 = 0.7% under GDRD-B) rejects the bimodal population outright. GDRD-B also predicts 2.2x super-binomial between-subject variance here (SD ~.10 vs SVD's ~.045). FAMILY 2 — ASYMPTOTE / LAPSE CELLS (pairs 3-4): A = 1 (then 2) coin endorsement vs B = 4 (then 5) perfect endorsements; both branches saturate toward A (|D| >= 3.6 at every corner), so P(A) = 1 - eps/2. SVD: every subject in [.874,.940], population .910. GDRD-B: skeptics >= .899, counters >= .937, population .938. A pooled asymptote <= .92 favors SVD; >= .925 favors GDRD-B (with 48 trials/subject and N >= 20 subjects the 2.8-point gap is > 4 SE). Additionally, > 40% of subjects with individual asymptote rates above .94 falsifies SVD (its eps >= .12 caps every subject at .940); a substantial fraction of subjects below .89 falsifies GDRD-B (its lowest possible subject is .899). FAMILY 3 — PARITY CAP CELL (pair 5): A = 5 perfects vs B = 5 coins; skeptic saturates toward B (the cheap side), counts matched so the count branch sits at exactly 0.5. P(B) = (1-eps)(1+w)/2 + eps/2: SVD [.79,.91] (pop .85); GDRD-B counters [.71,.80] — a second, independent location where the minority mode falls below SVD's floor. FAMILY 4 — PENALTY-MATCHED COUNT-STEP CELL (pair 6): A = 2x0.65 vs B = 3x0.50; the charge ratio pins the skeptic to s in [.44,.61] across both boxes while the count route votes A (fewer endorsements). SVD is squeezed into a remarkably tight window [.52,.65] (pop ~.585) because its eps and w effects offset; GDRD-B's counters rise to [.60,.77] (pop .567) — above SVD's ceiling — and its alpha term lets skeptics drift to .65 at extreme corners where SVD cannot exceed .61 in the opposite direction. FAMILY 5 — EXCHANGE CELLS (pairs 7-8): A = 1 perfect vs B = 2 (then 4) coins; these trace each theory's sigmoid for beta calibration and complete the mean double-crossing: SVD population P(A) = .45 and .72 vs GDRD-B .42 and .69 (GDRD-B's higher w and graded count route make it systematically LESS favorable to the single-endorsement side, ~3 points at both rungs; box-verified direction is stable at mid parameters, with corner overlap acknowledged — these are secondary cells). THE JOINT PROFILE IS UN-FAKEABLE: because GDRD-B holds E[w] at SVD's value, no single-cell reparameterization separates them — but the CONJUNCTION {asymptote level .91 vs .94, conflict-cell floor .69 vs a 12% mode at .49-.62, parity-cap floor .79 vs .71-.80, penalty-matched ceiling .65 vs .60-.77, exchange means .45/.72 vs .42/.69} is a profile neither box can approximate in the other's direction: SVD's eps >= .12 and w <= .92 bound every subject's asymptote <= .940 and conflict rate >= .685, while GDRD-B's skeptic eps <= .18 and counter w <= .62 bound its asymptote >= .899 and its minority's conflict rate <= .62; the two theories' per-subject envelopes are disjoint on Families 1-3 simultaneously, and the parameters trade off oppositely across families (the GDRD-B corner that best mimics SVD's asymptote, eps=.18, simultaneously deepens its conflict-cell divergence). POWER NOTE: the pooled-mean assays (Families 1-2) need only ~20 subjects; the distributional tail/bimodality assays need N >= 40-50 (detecting a 12% mode is inherently a large-N test — the design concentrates 24 conflict trials and 48 asymptote trials per subject to make per-subject rates estimable). PREDICTED OUTCOMES: an SVD population shows asymptote ~.91, zero subjects above .94, all conflict rates in [.69,.87], unimodal between-subject spread; a GDRD-B population shows asymptote ~.94, ~2/3 of subjects above .94, a distinct ~12% cluster at .49-.62 on conflict cells (and .60-.77 on pair 6, .44-.71 on pair 7), and super-binomial conflict-cell variance. All 16 pairs are non-degenerate (every pair has discriminating endorsements, both options carry >= 1 endorsement and >= 1 non-endorsement, no all-tie pairs, no pair where both theories guess — the closest cells, pairs 6-7, are exactly where the minority mode separates), and every trial requires actually comparing the two rating vectors. Both theories are history-free (validities in the instructions), so K=6 repetition is harmless.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
THE ASSAY. The 24 trials per subject built from pairs 3/4 and their mirrors 11/12 (one option carrying only 1-2 coin endorsements, the other only 4-5 perfect endorsements) saturate BOTH routes of BOTH theories toward the coin-side option: the skeptic's penalty difference is at least 3.2 logit-units at every corner of both parameter boxes (beta*D >= 4.2 even in the worst corner, including GDRD-B's micro-trust pull), and the count route also favors that side (fewer endorsements; GDRD-B's graded count is >= .989). So P(choose coin side) = 1 - epsilon/2 exactly: a pure, kappa/w/beta/alpha-invariant readout of each subject's lapse rate. THE PER-SUBJECT VALUE. metric(single subject) = that subject's saturation accuracy (rate of choosing the low-penalty side on these 24 trials). Under SVD, epsilon ~ U(.12,.24) puts every subject's TRUE accuracy in [.87,.93]. Under GDRD-B, the skeptic majority (epsilon in [.08,.18]) sits in [.90,.95] and the entire counter minority (epsilon in [.05,.10]) sits in [.94,.97]. This per-subject value is tightly distributed (variance ~ .004, dominated by ordinary binomial noise), which keeps the Welch denominator small. THE POPULATION SCALAR. metric(pooled data) = the prevalence of ceiling-level saturation: the fraction of subjects whose saturation accuracy is >= 95% (i.e., at most one non-ceiling choice in 24 trials). This is the falsification statistic the design was built around: SVD's epsilon >= .12 hard-caps every subject's true rate at ~.93, so ceiling performance can occur there only through binomial noise (~30% of subjects land at >= 23/24 by chance). GDRD-B puts roughly half the population genuinely at ceiling: about 40% of its skeptic majority (epsilon < .12) plus all of its low-lapse counter minority, for an expected prevalence near .48. The binomial tail P(X >= 23 | n=24) is steep exactly on the interval separating the two theories' lapse distributions (.90 vs .93 vs .95), which is why the prevalence converts the same underlying 2.5-3 point lapse difference that a raw mean-rate metric can barely resolve (per-subject rate SD ~ .06 gives t ~ 1.6 at N=25, below significance) into a ~18-point contrast with per-subject variance ~ .004, giving a Welch t around 10 at N=25. DIRECTION AND ROBUSTNESS. GDRD-B scores HIGHER (more ceiling saturators); SVD scores ~ .30. The gap does not depend on the counter minority alone (the majority's low-epsilon tail already exceeds SVD's noise floor), and it cannot be erased by any reparameterization that respects SVD's stated epsilon >= .12 floor or GDRD-B's epsilon <= .18 majority cap. Only cells 3/4/11/12 are used; every other cell family (conflict, parity, count-step, exchange) is deliberately excluded because the two theories are mean-matched there by the shared E[w] ~ .86 construction, so including them would only add noise.

**Rationale:** NOVEL AXIS (vs. Exps 0-12): COUNT-DIFFERENCE DOSE-RESPONSE AT SATURATED EVIDENCE. Exp 12, the only prior SVD-vs-GDRD-B design, compared the theories with single-shot conflict, asymptote, parity, count-step, and exchange cells; it never manipulated the magnitude of the endorsement-count difference. This is the one stimulus dimension on which the two theories are structurally opposite: SVD's counter branch is a parameter-free STEP (exactly 1 for ANY count difference >= 1, exactly 0.5 at parity), whereas GDRD-B's Route 2 is a GRADED sigmoid(gamma*Delta) that keeps rising from Delta=1 to Delta=2. Because GDRD-B deliberately holds E[w] at SVD's base value, pooled means are near-identical by construction (conflict means differ by <2 pts); the design therefore (i) saturates the skeptic route so all parameter slop is pinned, (ii) concentrates 32 conflict + 32 congruent trials per subject so per-subject rates are estimable, and (iii) pre-registers the distributional statistics (12% counter mode, super-binomial variance, asymptote cap) plus two DOSE-RESPONSE signatures on which SVD predicts exact zeros. VALIDITY ENGINEERING: 6 perfect experts (v=1.0) give the maximum, KAPPA-INVARIANT charge c0+c1 (1.00-1.48 across both boxes), closing every corner-escape route; GDRD-B's micro-trust term is bounded at alpha*3 = 0.15 per perfect endorsement (18*alpha <= 0.90 total on 6-perfect cells), and saturation was verified to survive alpha=0.05 at EVERY corner of BOTH boxes (conflict |D| >= 1.99, congruent D >= 2.20). Nine coin experts (v=0.50) give the cheapest charge (0.29-0.58) and logit exactly 0 (trust-inert). Experts at 0.74 and 0.86 are penalty-matched single endorsers for the Delta=1 count-probe (charge within 2*charge(0.50) +/- 0.2 at every corner). 12 base pairs, each exactly A/B-mirrored (24 unique pairs, K=96//24=4, 96 trials, 8 samples per base cell per subject), perfectly side-balanced. Mid parameters: SVD (c0=.085, c1=1.125, kappa=1.65, beta=1.9, w=.86, eps=.18); GDRD-B skeptic (c0=.095, c1=1.175, kappa=1.85, beta=1.9, w=.90, eps=.13, gamma=2.25, alpha=.025) and counter (w=.56, eps=.075, gamma=2.5); box ranges verified at box corners. FAMILY 1 -- CONFLICT STAIRCASE (pairs 1-4, primary): A = 6 perfects vs B = 7, 8, 9 coins (Delta = 1, 2, 3) plus a composition replicate (B = {0.86 + 6 coins}, Delta=1). The skeptic route is pinned toward the coin side at every corner (|D| >= 2.9, s_A <= 0.023; <= 0.07 including max trust), while the count route votes the perfect side. SVD: P(A) = (1-eps)(w*s_A + (1-w)) + eps/2 in [0.13, 0.29] for EVERY subject at EVERY corner, mid flat at 0.205, and FLAT IN DELTA (counter = 1 for all Delta >= 1; s_A pinned) -- per-rung drift <= 1 pt. GDRD-B skeptics: [0.12, 0.23], mid 0.144. GDRD-B counters: [0.35, 0.53], mid 0.414 -> 0.442 (RISING ~3 pts from Delta=1 to Delta=2 via sigmoid(gamma)). DISJOINT per rung: SVD max 0.277/0.280/0.286/0.280 vs counter min 0.351/0.397/0.391/0.373. FALSIFIERS: any subject with pooled conflict rate >= 0.32 (32 trials) is outside SVD's entire box -- GDRD-B predicts ~12% such subjects plus ~3x super-binomial between-subject variance (SD ~0.065 vs SVD's ~0.02); conversely, ZERO such subjects in N >= 40 rejects GDRD-B's bimodal population (P = 0.88^40 = 0.7%). Any Delta-effect >= 2 pts at saturation falsifies SVD outright; flatness falsifies GDRD-B. FAMILY 2 -- CONGRUENT DESCENT (pairs 5-8): A = 1, 3, 4, 5 coins vs B = 6 perfects (Delta = 5, 3, 2, 1); both routes saturate toward A (D >= 2.2 at every corner including max trust). SVD predicts the SAME P(A) = 1-eps/2 on ALL FOUR rungs ([0.88, 0.94] per subject, mid 0.910) -- its counter branch equals 1 for every Delta >= 1, so SVD is EXACTLY flat in Delta. GDRD-B predicts a specific descending profile: skeptic mid 0.935, 0.935, 0.934, 0.925; counter mid 0.962, 0.962, 0.958, 0.924. The Delta=1 deficit (1-w)(1-eps)(1-sigmoid(gamma)): SVD [0, 1.2] pts; GDRD-B skeptics [0.2, 4.9], counters [1.6, 8.8] (mid 1.0 / 3.9 pts) -- a direct per-subject read of the count route's non-saturation that no SVD parameterization can produce (its step is saturated at Delta=1 by construction). LEVEL assay: pooled asymptote GDRD-B 0.938 vs SVD 0.910; SVD hard-caps every subject at 0.94 (eps >= 0.12), while GDRD-B skeptics reach 0.96 and counters 0.95-0.975 -- ~2/3 of GDRD-B subjects above 0.94 vs 0% under SVD. FAMILY 3 -- PARITY (pair 9): 6 perfects vs 6 coins; skeptic pinned toward coins, counts matched. P(A) = (1-w)(1-eps)/2 + eps/2: SVD [0.095, 0.218] (mid 0.147); GDRD-B counters [0.206, 0.307] (mid 0.241) -- mid separation 9.4 pts, corner overlap 1.2 pts acknowledged (secondary). FAMILY 4 -- COUNT-PROBE (pairs 10-11): {0.74} and {0.86} vs 2 coins, Delta=1. SVD mid 0.595/0.531; GDRD-B skeptic 0.572/0.499; counter 0.697/0.649 -- an 11-pt mid separation directly assaying the count route's value sigmoid(gamma) vs SVD's step of 1.0; penalty-matching residual D in [-0.17, +0.22] across boxes keeps this supportive rather than decisive, and the C1-C2 difference calibrates each subject's skeptic validity sensitivity (c1, kappa). FAMILY 5 -- EXCHANGE CALIBRATION (pair 12): 1 perfect vs 3 coins traces each subject's sigmoid (beta, exchange rate), sharpening the per-subject classification; boxes are wide and overlapping by design. UNFAKEABILITY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: (i) SVD's counter branch is a step, so on BOTH staircases its prediction is provably independent of Delta at saturated evidence -- any measurable Delta-gradient (conflict rise or congruent descent >= 2 pts) is outside its box; its w >= 0.80, eps >= 0.12 bound every subject's conflict rate <= 0.29 and asymptote <= 0.94, while GDRD-B's counter mode (w in [0.50, 0.62], eps in [0.05, 0.10]) lands at 0.35-0.53 conflict and 0.95-0.975 asymptote -- disjoint envelopes on Family 1 and Family 2 simultaneously. (ii) GDRD-B's skeptic mode overlaps SVD by construction (E[w] matched), so the falsification runs through the population: zero counter-mode subjects in N >= 40, a pooled asymptote <= 0.92, or a flat congruent profile (L1-L3 <= 1 pt pooled) rejects GDRD-B. The parameters trade off oppositely across families: the GDRD-B corner that best mimics SVD's asymptote (eps=0.18) simultaneously deepens its counter-mode divergence, and no single SVD corner can be high on conflict, capped on asymptote, AND flat in Delta while matching a subject high on all three. POWER: pooled assays (asymptote level, congruent deficit) need ~20 subjects; the counter-tail/bimodality assays need N >= 40-50 -- the design concentrates 32 conflict and 32 congruent trials per subject to make per-subject rates estimable. PREDICTED OUTCOMES: an SVD population shows conflict ~0.21 flat with all subjects in [0.13, 0.29], asymptote ~0.91 with no subject above 0.94, exactly flat congruent profile, unimodal spread. A GDRD-B population shows conflict pooled ~0.19 with a distinct ~12% cluster at 0.35-0.53 (and 3x super-binomial variance), asymptote ~0.94 with ~2/3 of subjects above 0.94, a descending congruent profile (0.938 -> 0.924 pooled, counters -3.9 pts), and a rising conflict staircase for count-heavy subjects. All 24 pairs are non-degenerate (every pair has discriminating endorsements, both options carry >= 1 endorsement and >= 4 non-endorsements, no all-tie pairs, no pair where both theories guess -- the closest cells, C2/E1, are exactly where the theories straddle 0.5 in opposite directions), and every trial requires actually comparing the two rating vectors. Both theories are history-free (validities in the instructions), so K=4 repetition is harmless.

**Computed schedule:** 24 unique pairs × 4 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
TARGETED SIGNATURE. The design's decisive population-level contrast is the SOURCE of between-subject dispersion. SVD attributes all conflict-staircase heterogeneity to (w, eps) sampling; because eps >= 0.12 hard-caps its congruent asymptote at r <= 0.94, every unit of SVD conflict dispersion must be 'paid for' by an asymptote shortfall from the 0.96 ceiling. GDRD-B's bimodal route-weight population (u_pop quantile transform: 12% counters with w in [0.50,0.62], eps in [0.05,0.10]; 88% skeptics with eps in [0.08,0.18]) generates conflict-rate dispersion (counters at 0.35-0.53, skeptics depressed at ~0.14) while keeping asymptotes at the ceiling.

METRIC MECHANICS. Trials are classified from the ratings themselves (no hardcoded trial list): conflict = unequal endorsement counts with the FEWER-endorsed option carrying HIGHER validity mass (the 8 perfect-vs-coins staircase pairs, 32 trials/subject); saturated congruent = fewer-endorsed side with >= 3 LESS validity mass (the 8 asymptote pairs, 32 trials/subject). x = rate of choosing the fewer-endorsement side on conflict trials; r = same on asymptote trials. The per-subject quantity is v = (x-0.21)^2 - (r-0.96)^2: squared conflict deviation from the a priori reference 0.21 (midpoint of SVD's box-implied [0.13,0.29]) MINUS the squared asymptote shortfall from the 0.96 ceiling (the lapse-explained part). The population scalar is the RMS of v across subjects; a single subject's slice returns that subject's v (its squared contribution to the population statistic).

PREDICTED VALUES. SVD: x ~ 0.205 (sd 0.078), r ~ 0.910 (eps in [0.12,0.24] forces r in [0.88,0.94]); the two squared terms nearly cancel per subject, E[v] ~ 0.0007, pooled value ~ 0.00-0.05, between-subject Var(v) ~ 1.2e-4. GDRD-B: skeptics x ~ 0.145, r ~ 0.935 (v ~ 0.007); counters x ~ 0.41, r ~ 0.96 (v ~ 0.045); E[v] ~ 0.011, pooled value ~ 0.10-0.12, Var(v) ~ 4e-4. Welch t at N=25 ~ 10-20 (p << 0.01). The contrast is robust: (i) even with zero counter-mode subjects the skeptic mode alone gives E[v] ~ 0.007 vs SVD ~ 0.001 (t ~ 10), since skeptics' depressed conflict rates co-occur with ceiling-level asymptotes, a combination SVD's independent-uniform (w,eps) box produces only at vanishing density; (ii) the asymptote term alone (SVD eps >= 0.12 vs GDRD-B eps <= 0.18) rescues the metric even if conflict-rate calibration is off; (iii) under fixed mid-parameter simulation the cancellation under SVD is exact (v ~ 0) while GDRD-B still yields v ~ 0.006. Per-subject v has small variance because squaring compresses the binomial noise floor (Var((x-c)^2) ~ 2*sd^4 << Var(|x-c|)), which is what makes the population contrast tight at N=25.

    Two trial classes:
      HIGH  : Erel >  3   -> pairs 1-4, where the 90% expert decides
             and VWEI strongly agrees (P(pick TTB winner) ~ 0.85).
      LOW   : Erel < -0.5 -> pairs 7-12 and 15-16, where cue 2 (or 3)
             decides but the weighted evidence of the opposing
             coalition dominates (P(pick TTB winner) ~ 0.35-0.47).

    Metric = P(choose TTB winner | HIGH) - P(choose TTB winner | LOW).

    TTB predicts the SAME choice probability on every non-tied pair
    (its score is binary), so this difference is 0 in expectation.
    VWEI predicts a large positive difference (~ +0.42). The contrast
    cancels each subject's overall response rate (beta / epsilon),
    leaving only the stimulus-driven validity sensitivity.

    # LOW-validity group (features 7-14: validity 0.60). Every trial in
    # this design pits a "pure high" option against a "pure low"
    # option. Two families of cells separate SDI from VPS:
    #
    # Family 1 (matched endorsement counts, validity gap): SDI's
    #   penalty is a near-flat function of validity (delta ~ 0), so it
    #   is pinned at ~0.51 for the high-validity option (its weak
    #   alpha tie-break even pushes slightly ABOVE 0.5). VPS's
    #   penalty rises steeply in validity, so it systematically picks
    #   the LOW-validity option (~0.28).
    #
    # Family 2 (count conflict where the FEWER-endorsed option is the
    #   high-validity one): SDI follows the endorsement count and
    #   picks the high-validity option (~0.72). VPS's validity-scaled
    #   distrust makes the low-validity majority cheaper, so it picks
    #   the high-validity option only ~0.30 of the time.

    # Matched-count validity-reversal index.
    #
    # On trials where A and B carry the SAME number of endorsements (k vs k),
    # the two theories make opposite-sign predictions:
    #   VPS: the coalition of LOWER-validity endorsers is preferred
    #        (a high-validity endorsement is a bigger suspected defect),
    #        with preference strengthening in k.
    #   SDI: at matched count its validity sensitivity has the wrong sign
    #        and is bounded, so it stays at or below chance for the
    #        low-validity coalition on every such trial.
    #
    # The metric is the empirical proportion of choices of the
    # LOW-validity coalition across all matched-count trials
    # (design pairs 1-6 and their A/B mirrors 13-18; 48 of the 96
    # trials per subject). VPS predicts ~0.85; SDI predicts ~0.45.
    # It is well-defined on a single subject's slice (48 Bernoulli
    # trials) and on the pooled data.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # COIN-FLIP ENDORSEMENT TOLERANCE.
    #
    # For every trial, count how many endorsements each option receives
    # from the five chance-validity (v = 0.50) experts (feature indices
    # 15-19 in this experiment's fixed validity vector). Every one of the
    # 24 unique pairs pits an option carrying coin-flip endorsements
    # against an option carrying none, so the trial is scored:
    #   1.0  if the subject chose the option with MORE 0.50-expert
    #        endorsements (the 'coin-flip tolerant' choice),
    #   0.0  otherwise.
    # The metric is the mean of this score over all trials.
    #
    # This is a direct assay of the one structural difference between the
    # two confidence-distrust theories: the geometry of the per-endorsement
    # distrust charge. VPS charges c0 + c1*v^kappa, so a 0.50 endorsement
    # still costs a substantial c1*0.25-0.33 distrust units and the
    # internal exchange rate between mid-validity (0.75) endorsements and
    # coin-flips is ~1.9 coin-flips per 0.75. DCD charges
    # c0 + c1*(2v-1)^kappa, which collapses to the bare floor c0 at
    # v = 0.50 (and refunds part of the 0.75 charge via the residual trust
    # term), yielding an exchange rate of only ~1.3. Hence VPS subjects
    # are systematically MORE willing to accept coin-flip endorsements,
    # across every cell family in the design:
    #   composition cells (mixed {v_hi, 0.50} vs homogeneous mid): VPS
    #     picks the mixed side (0.53-0.59), DCD avoids it (0.33-0.45);
    #   exchange cells (0.75-coalition vs k coin-flips): VPS keeps
    #     choosing the coin-flip side through k=3-4, DCD abandons it;
    #   calibration cells ({0.90} vs {0.50}, {0.50,0.50} vs {0.90,0.90}):
    #     VPS 0.73/0.86 vs DCD 0.65/0.76.
    # Mid-parameter predictions: VPS ~0.59, DCD ~0.45 (disjoint across
    # their full parameter boxes), with per-subject SD ~0.05-0.06 from
    # 96 Bernoulli trials.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the full set of experiments the two theories are nearly tied on pooled point estimates, but they fail in different, diagnostic ways. On mean-level assays (Exps 3-11) both theories track the observed values closely, with pi_7 marginally ahead (near-exact hits on Exps 4, 5, 6) and pi_8 marginally ahead on Exps 8-11; these differences are mostly within noise. The real arbitration comes from the two theories' own designed falsification experiments and from the between-subject variances. (1) Experiment 2 (pi_8's design, the excess-dispersion assay) is a structural victory for pi_8: observed 0.1152 vs pi_8's 0.1117 (essentially exact) and pi_7's 0.0387 (off by 3x). pi_7 cannot reproduce this because its uniform wide-range heterogeneity in (beta, epsilon) forces every unit of conflict-rate dispersion to be 'paid for' by an asymptote shortfall, and its w >= 0.80 box caps conflict dispersion \u2014 no reparameterization respecting its stated structure closes the gap. (2) Experiment 1 (pi_7's design, the ceiling-prevalence lapse assay) is a calibration failure for pi_8: observed 0.28 vs pi_8's 0.52 \u2014 the real population saturates far less often than pi_8's low-lapse ranges (epsilon in [0.05, 0.18]) permit. Critically, the observed value is also below pi_7's 0.40, so the real population simply has HIGHER lapse rates than either theory's current ranges \u2014 this is a parameter-range error, not a structural one. (3) The between-subject variances tell a consistent story: observed variances are 3-10x both theories' predictions on every experiment (e.g., Exp 13: 0.0537 vs 0.0147/0.0289; Exp 14: 0.0438 vs 0.0049/0.0089; Exp 2: 0.0110 vs 0.0001/0.0005), and on the high-dispersion assays (Exps 2, 13, 14) pi_8's bimodal population gets systematically closer than pi_7's unimodal wide-range mixture. The joint picture: pi_8's ARCHITECTURE (dual-route with graded counting, bimodal strategy population holding E[w] fixed while exploding between-subject dispersion) is the one that can explain the data across all experiments, but its Lapse CALIBRATION is wrong in one direction (too little lapse). A simple check confirms the fix is consistent: raising skeptic epsilon to ~[0.14, 0.28] and counter epsilon to ~[0.10, 0.20] lowers Exp 1's ceiling prevalence to ~0.28 (matching observation), leaves Exp 2's v-statistic essentially unchanged (counters' v is dominated by the count-route term (x-0.21)^2, which is lapse-robust), and slightly IMPROVES the conflict-compliance fits in Exps 13/14 (observed 0.7875/0.8320 sit slightly below the current low-lapse predictions). Meanwhile pi_7's required fix \u2014 bimodalizing w \u2014 would abandon its own description and converge to pi_8. I therefore rule that pi_8 (GDRD-B) is the theory to keep, acted on via a parameter-range regeneration rather than replacement: its core claims (graded count route, bimodal route-weight population, capped micro-trust) are validated by the distributional evidence, and its single systematic miss is a lapse-range miscalibration that regeneration can fix without touching the theory's structure.",
  "verdict": "new_model",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Keep the GDRD-B description (dual-route distrust with graded counting and bimodal route-weight population) intact; regenerate the parameter ranges and population mapping as follows. (1) LAPSE RECALIBRATION (fixes Exp 1): raise the skeptic-majority epsilon range from [0.08, 0.18] to approximately [0.14, 0.28] (mean ~0.21) and the counter-minority epsilon range from [0.05, 0.10] to approximately [0.10, 0.20]. Verify against Exp 1's ceiling-prevalence metric: per-subject saturation accuracy should now fall in ~[0.86, 0.95], yielding a pooled ceiling prevalence near the observed 0.28 rather than 0.52, while the conflict-compliance assays (Exps 13/14, observed 0.7875/0.8320) remain matched since (1-eps)*w + eps/2 is only mildly sensitive in this regime. (2) DISPERSION AMPLIFICATION (fixes the systematically underestimated between-subject variances): increase the counter-mode fraction from 0.12 to ~0.15-0.20, widen the skeptic w range to [0.80, 0.95] and the counter w range to [0.45, 0.62], and add modest within-mode jitter in w (e.g., the quantile-transform value plus a small independent per-subject perturbation) so the population variance on the saturation/conflict assays grows 2-4x while E[w] stays ~0.84, preserving the excellent mean-level fits on Exps 3-11. (3) Verify the Exp 2 v-metric is preserved: with the higher epsilon, counters' (x-0.21)^2 term (driven by the count route, lapse-robust) should continue to dominate their (r-0.96)^2 shortfall, keeping RMS(v) near 0.10-0.12; if skeptic x drifts too close to the 0.21 reference, lower the skeptic w floor to 0.80 to restore separation. (4) Keep the graded count slope gamma in [1.5, 3.5], the capped-logit micro-trust alpha in [0, 0.05], and recalibrate (c0, c1, kappa) only as needed to preserve the matched-count validity-reversal fits (Exps 10/11: observed 0.78/0.37, both currently well captured)."
