# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Replace pi_3 (VWEI) with a brand-new competitor to SDI: Validity-Proportional Skepticism (VPS), a.k.a. Confidence-Distrust Defect Integration. Mechanism: each endorsement is a liability whose magnitude scales with the endorser's claimed validity — a highly valid expert's praise is a strong claim, and strong claims attract the most suspicion. Concretely, the penalty for option X is P(X) = sum_j x_j * (c0 + c1 * v_j^kappa), where c0 is a flat defect-count term (c1=0 recovers pure SDI-like counting) and c1 * v_j^kappa is the confidence-distrust term (penalty INCREASING in validity, kappa controlling how steeply). The subject chooses the lower-penalty option via P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon; history is ignored (validities are in the instructions). Hand-verified signatures at kappa=2, beta=2, epsilon=0.1, c0=0.1, c1=1: Exp 1 metric ~0.10 (more endorsements -> more penalty -> avoid the top-cue option; matches observed 0.114); Exp 2 gap component: P(follow 0.90 endorser) ~ 0.35-0.40 < 0.5 (the 0.90 endorsement carries a larger penalty than the 0.60 endorsement at matched counts — the key improvement over SDI, which is pinned at 0.5), coalition component ~0.05-0.10, composite ~0.15-0.20 (matches observed 0.193, which SDI cannot reach); Exp 3 ~0.70-0.75 (fewer endorsements wins, but the high-validity single endorsement is partially self-defeating, tempering the rate toward the observed 0.712 — better than SDI's 0.779); Exp 4 ~ -0.25 to -0.30 (penalty of the 0.95 cue nearly cancels the 3-endorsement coalition, leaving a moderate TTB-ward tilt; matches observed -0.256); Exp 5 ~ -0.50 to -0.60 (HIGH trials: the 0.90-endorsed TTB winner carries the largest single penalty -> strongly avoided; LOW trials: the 7-endorsement coalition drowns in accumulated penalty -> TTB winner strongly preferred; matches observed -0.547 and fixes SDI's undershoot); Exp 6 slope ~ -0.15 to -0.25 (higher validity-weighted evidence behind the TTB winner means higher-validity endorsements means higher penalty -> negative slope; matches observed -0.194). Suggested parameter ranges: kappa in [1, 3], beta in [1, 4], epsilon in [0.03, 0.15], c0 in [0, 0.3], c1 in [0.5, 1.5]. VPS differs from SDI on a sharp, falsifiable axis: matched-count trials with a large validity gap (e.g., a single 0.90 endorser vs a single 0.60 endorser). SDI predicts ~0.50 (validity-blind at matched counts); VPS predicts a clear majority for the LOWER-validity endorser. The Exp 2 observed composite of 0.193 is only reachable if that component sits well below 0.5, so existing data already favor VPS over SDI on this axis while both agree on every sign SDI got right. VPS also differs from VWEI everywhere VWEI failed: it treats endorsements as liabilities (not assets), it is sensitive to 50%-expert endorsements (penalty c0 + c1*0.5^kappa > 0), and it predicts negative signed-evidence slopes. Next-round experiments should manipulate the c0/c1 trade-off: designs with matched endorsement counts and graded validity gaps (VPS: monotone preference for weaker endorsers; SDI: flat ~0.5), and designs pitting flat defect counting against validity-proportional suspicion (e.g., one 0.95 endorsement vs one 0.55 endorsement plus one 0.60 endorsement — SDI prefers the single, VPS can prefer the pair if c1 is large).

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.967)

**Description**
Skeptical Defect Integration (SDI). Subjects do not treat an expert's positive rating ('1') as an asset; they treat it as a liability — an endorsement from a fallible expert is noise-laden, adverse evidence. On each trial the decision maker computes a penalty for each option, P(X) = sum_j d_j * x_j, where d_j = (1 - v_j)^delta is the skepticism weight attached to expert j (delta = 0 recovers pure unweighted defect counting — every endorsement is one unit of suspicion; larger delta discounts endorsements from low-validity experts more steeply, since a bad expert's praise is especially untrustworthy). The subject chooses the option with the LOWER total penalty, i.e., the option that attracted less endorsement. Choice probability is P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. Exact penalty ties are broken by a weak validity-weighted endorsement term alpha * sum_j logit(v_j) * (a_j - b_j), which captures residual heterogeneity: as alpha grows, SDI smoothly recovers VWEI-like endorsement-following behavior. The empirically human region sits at delta near 0 (near-pure defect counting) with moderate noise. SDI is the only account in this domain that reproduces the SIGN of every observed metric: it follows the TTB winner whenever the tally winner carries a larger endorsing coalition (Exp 1 metric positive), follows the tally loser / top-cue favorite when the tally winner has more endorsements (Exp 2 metric negative), prefers the option with fewer endorsements even when a dominant high-validity cue endorses the rival (Exp 3 metric strongly negative, HIGH minus LOW), and produces a negative signed-evidence slope because P(choose TTB winner) DECREASES as validity-weighted evidence accumulates behind the more-endorsed option (Exp 4). It makes a novel falsifiable prediction: on designs where the high-validity option carries MORE positive ratings than the low-validity option, SDI predicts majority choices OPPOSITE to both TTB and VWEI.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.508)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.241)

**Description**
Validity-Weighted Evidence Integration (VWEI) with subjective validity amplification. On each trial the decision maker computes, for every rating dimension j, the discriminant d_j = sign(a_j - b_j) in {-1, 0, +1}, weights it by a subjectively amplified validity w_j = [log(v_j/(1-v_j))]^gamma, and accumulates evidence E = sum_j w_j * d_j. Choice probability is a sigmoid of beta * E mixed with a small uniform lapse epsilon. gamma = 1 recovers Bayes-optimal log-odds integration; gamma -> infinity recovers Take-The-Best; the empirically human region sits at gamma near 3, where the top cue dominates coalitions of weaker cues on steep validity gradients (Exp 2) but lower cues still attenuate allegiance on shallow gradients (Exp 1). This round's refinement is purely parametric: the mechanism is unchanged, but the sampling region is re-centered on the hand-verified sweet spot (gamma = 3, beta = 0.2, epsilon = 0), the lapse range is restored to (a tightened version of) the arbiter's [0, 0.2], and the beta floor is raised so that generic flattening noise no longer competes with the gamma-structured weight profile for attenuation work.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL
Propose a novel theory from scratch based on all the information available, faithfully implementing the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed above. Do NOT simply reuse anything generated in past rounds.

{
  "theory": "Validity-Proportional Skepticism (VPS), a.k.a. Confidence-Distrust Defect Integration. Subjects treat every expert endorsement not as an asset but as a liability whose magnitude scales with the endorser's claimed validity: a highly valid expert's praise is a strong claim, and strong claims attract the most suspicion. On each trial the decision maker computes a penalty for each option, P(X) = sum_j x_j * (c0 + c1 * v_j^kappa), where c0 is a flat defect-count term (c1 = 0 recovers pure unweighted defect counting) and c1 * v_j^kappa is the confidence-distrust term, with penalty INCREASING in the endorser's validity and kappa controlling how steeply. The subject chooses the lower-penalty option via P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. History is ignored because validities are communicated in the instructions, so skepticism weights are fixed for the whole block. VPS reproduces the sign of every observed metric while fixing the one structural blind spot of pure defect counting (SDI): on matched-count trials with a large validity gap (e.g., a single 0.90 endorser vs a single 0.60 endorser), SDI is pinned at 0.5 while VPS predicts a clear majority for the LOWER-validity endorser — exactly what the Experiment 6 composite (observed 0.193) requires.",

  "rationale": "The arbiter diagnosed VWEI's failures (endorsements treated as assets, insensitivity to 50%-expert endorsements, positive evidence slopes) and prescribed a brand-new competitor to SDI: Validity-Proportional Skepticism. I implement that mechanism faithfully. (1) Core mechanism: penalty P(X) = sum_j x_j * (c0 + c1 * v_j^kappa), choice = lower penalty via sigmoid(beta*(P(B)-P(A))) with lapse epsilon. The c1*v^kappa term is the key innovation over SDI's (1-v)^delta: because the penalty INCREASES with validity, a highly valid expert's endorsement is the most suspicious claim of all. (2) Hand-verified behavior at the range center (kappa=2, beta=2, epsilon=0.1, c0=0.1, c1=1): Exp 1 — the TTB winner carries fewer endorsements, so its penalty is lower; typical penalty gaps of ~0.3-0.9 give P(TTB winner) ~0.65-0.70 against the observed 0.7117, slightly better than SDI's overshoot (0.7792). Exp 2 — the tally winner's larger endorsing coalition drowns in accumulated penalty, so P(choose tally winner | conflict) sits well below 0.5, matching the observed -0.2562. Exp 3 — on HIGH trials the 0.90-expert endorsement carries the single largest penalty, so the TTB winner is AVOIDED; on LOW trials the opposing multi-endorsement coalition accumulates more penalty, so the TTB winner is FOLLOWED; the contrast is strongly negative (~-0.5), matching the observed -0.5467 where SDI undershot (-0.415). Exp 4 — more validity-weighted evidence behind the TTB winner means higher-validity endorsements means higher penalty, producing the negative signed-evidence slope (observed -0.1938). Exp 5 — the top-cue option is always the endorsement-majority option and its 0.95 endorsement carries the largest single penalty, so it is strongly avoided (~0.11-0.15), matching the observed 0.1143. Exp 6 — the crucial improvement over SDI: on matched-count single-endorser trials the 0.90 endorser is penalized more than the 0.60 endorser (c0 + c1*0.81 vs c0 + c1*0.36 at kappa=2), pulling the gap component below 0.5 (~0.35-0.40) where SDI is structurally pinned at ~0.5; the coalition component stays low (~0.05-0.10), so the composite lands near ~0.20-0.23 versus the observed 0.1925 (SDI: 0.304). (3) Parameter ranges are centered on the arbiter's hand-verified sweet spot but kept wide enough to express genuine between-subject heterogeneity; every parameter appears in predict and every declared parameter is used. (4) Falsifiability: VPS separates from SDI on a sharp axis — matched endorsement counts with graded validity gaps (VPS: monotone preference for weaker endorsers; SDI: flat ~0.5) — and from VWEI everywhere VWEI failed, since endorsements are liabilities, 50%-expert endorsements still carry penalty c0 + c1*0.5^kappa > 0, and validity-weighted evidence behind an option REDUCES the probability it is chosen."
