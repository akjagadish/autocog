## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended decision-making theories make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every theory agrees, and prefer pairs that maximally dissociate the candidate theories. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Skeptical Defect Integration (SDI). Subjects do not treat an expert's positive rating ('1') as an asset; they treat it as a liability — an endorsement from a fallible expert is noise-laden, adverse evidence. On each trial the decision maker computes a penalty for each option, P(X) = sum_j d_j * x_j, where d_j = (1 - v_j)^delta is the skepticism weight attached to expert j (delta = 0 recovers pure unweighted defect counting — every endorsement is one unit of suspicion; larger delta discounts endorsements from low-validity experts more steeply, since a bad expert's praise is especially untrustworthy). The subject chooses the option with the LOWER total penalty, i.e., the option that attracted less endorsement. Choice probability is P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. Exact penalty ties are broken by a weak validity-weighted endorsement term alpha * sum_j logit(v_j) * (a_j - b_j), which captures residual heterogeneity: as alpha grows, SDI smoothly recovers VWEI-like endorsement-following behavior. The empirically human region sits at delta near 0 (near-pure defect counting) with moderate noise. SDI is the only account in this domain that reproduces the SIGN of every observed metric: it follows the TTB winner whenever the tally winner carries a larger endorsing coalition (Exp 1 metric positive), follows the tally loser / top-cue favorite when the tally winner has more endorsements (Exp 2 metric negative), prefers the option with fewer endorsements even when a dominant high-validity cue endorses the rival (Exp 3 metric strongly negative, HIGH minus LOW), and produces a negative signed-evidence slope because P(choose TTB winner) DECREASES as validity-weighted evidence accumulates behind the more-endorsed option (Exp 4). It makes a novel falsifiable prediction: on designs where the high-validity option carries MORE positive ratings than the low-validity option, SDI predicts majority choices OPPOSITE to both TTB and VWEI.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Validity-Proportional Skepticism (VPS), a.k.a. Confidence-Distrust Defect Integration. Subjects treat every expert endorsement not as an asset but as a liability whose magnitude scales with the endorser's claimed validity: a highly valid expert's praise is a strong claim, and strong claims attract the most suspicion. On each trial the decision maker computes a penalty for each option, P(X) = sum_j x_j * (c0 + c1 * v_j^kappa), where c0 is a flat defect-count term (c1 = 0 recovers pure unweighted defect counting) and c1 * v_j^kappa is the confidence-distrust term, with penalty INCREASING in the endorser's validity and kappa controlling how steeply. The subject chooses the lower-penalty option via P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. History is ignored because validities are communicated in the instructions, so skepticism weights are fixed for the whole block. VPS reproduces the sign of every observed metric while fixing the one structural blind spot of pure defect counting (SDI): on matched-count trials with a large validity gap (e.g., a single 0.90 endorser vs a single 0.60 endorser), SDI is pinned at 0.5 while VPS predicts a clear majority for the LOWER-validity endorser — exactly what the Experiment 6 composite (observed 0.193) requires.

## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] This design creates a quantitative double dissociation between Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying by exploiting their core structural difference: TTB's choice depends ONLY on the single highest-validity discriminating cue, while Tallying's choice depends ONLY on the total count of feature-wise wins. Validities are strictly spread and strictly ordered (0.90, 0.80, 0.70, 0.60, 0.55) so TTB's cue cascade is unambiguous. The design contains three families of trials, each mirrored across A/B to control for side bias. (1) Tally-tie trials (e.g., A=[1,0,0,0,0] vs B=[0,1,0,0,0]): the top cue favors one option but the tally is exactly 1-1. TTB predicts P(top-cue winner) = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2, which rises above 50% as beta grows; Tallying predicts EXACTLY 50% regardless of beta (softmax over equal scores is uniform), so any systematic preference here falsifies Tallying. (2) The critical conflict-gradient family: the top cue favors A, but B wins on an increasing number of lower cues (tally margins 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 against A). TTB predicts P(A) is CONSTANT across these margins (always sigmoid(beta) for A, since only cue 1 is consulted), whereas Tallying predicts a monotone, graded shift toward B as the tally margin grows (sigmoid(beta), sigmoid(2*beta), sigmoid(3*beta)). This flat-vs-graded profile is the central quantitative signature: a subject whose P(A) declines with tally margin is following Tallying; a subject whose P(A) stays flat is following TTB. (3) A second-order family where cues 1-2 tie and discrimination first occurs at cue 3 (with tally conflicts), testing whether the cascade truly skips tied cues. All 16 unique pairs are non-degenerate (no all-tie pairs) and every pair places the two theories in disagreement or in a guess-vs-decide asymmetry. With K = 96 // 16 = 6 repetitions per pair, each subject contributes 6 samples per cell of the design, giving good power to estimate the flat-vs-graded choice gradient that separates the theories.

[1] This design is the complementary mirror of the already-explored experiment: instead of holding TTB's deciding cue fixed and varying the tally margin, it holds the TALLY MARGIN fixed and varies WHICH CUE TTB's cascade lands on. Six experts with validities [0.95, 0.90, 0.85, 0.65, 0.60, 0.55] create a sharp gap between high-validity cues (1-3) and low-validity cues (4-6), so the identity of TTB's first discriminating cue is unambiguous. Every trial is built around a designated tally-winner W with a fixed tally margin m in {1, 2, 3}, crossed with the DIRECTION of the top discriminating cue: CONGRUENT cells (top cue favors W, so TTB and Tallying agree in direction) and CONFLICT cells (top cue favors the loser, so TTB and Tallying point in opposite directions). Within conflict cells at m=1, the deciding cue's position d is also varied (d=1..4), testing whether choices track the validity of the deciding cue. The quantitative signature is a 2x3 factorial of predicted P(W): Tallying predicts P(W) = sigmoid(m*beta) + lapse, i.e., IDENTICAL across congruent/conflict cells at each margin and a monotone gradient across margins [sigma(beta) < sigma(2*beta) < sigma(3*beta)]. TTB predicts P(W) = sigmoid(beta) in every congruent cell and 1 - sigmoid(beta) in every conflict cell, i.e., IDENTICAL across margins (its noise model does not scale with the number of supporting cues) and independent of which cue d decides. Thus Tallying predicts a main effect of margin only; TTB predicts a main effect of top-cue direction only. A subject whose P(W) rises with m at fixed direction is Tallying; a subject whose P(W) is flat across m but flips with cue direction is TTB. Even the congruent cells dissociate at m>=2 (sigma(beta) vs sigma(2*beta)), and the m=1 congruent cells serve as agreement baselines for estimating beta. All 12 base pairs are mirrored (A/B swapped) to control side bias, giving 24 unique pairs with K = 96 // 24 = 4 repetitions each (96 trials total, 8 samples per base cell per subject). No pair is degenerate (every pair has discriminating cues, none is an all-tie), and no pair leaves both theories in pure-guess agreement. Secondary exploratory axis: both theories predict FLAT P(W) across the deciding-cue position d (TTB because its softmax does not scale with validity, Tallying because it ignores validity entirely), so any graded sensitivity to d would falsify both — but the primary dissociation rests on the margin x direction interaction.

[2] This design exploits a structural chasm between TTB and VWEI: TTB's score is binary (winner=1, loser=0), so its softmax NEVER sees cue validity, coalition size, or coalition composition. Consequence: TTB predicts ONE constant choice probability, P(pick TTB's winner) = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2, on ALL 16 pairs — whether the deciding cue is the 90% expert or the 76% expert, and whether 0 or 7 lower cues oppose it. VWEI, with its bounded parameters (gamma in [2.8,3.2], beta in [0.18,0.23]), predicts a specific, monotone, non-flat profile across the same 16 pairs. The validity vector [0.90, 0.78, 0.76, 0.74, 0.72, 0.70, 0.68, 0.66, 0.64] is engineered so that (a) cue 1 (v=0.90, w=10.6) dominates every possible coalition, (b) cue 2 (v=0.78, w=2.03) is beaten by coalitions of 2+ of the next cues (w3+w4=2.68) but not by any single lower cue or by weak cues (w8+w9=0.48) — creating sign flips that are robust across the entire gamma range [2.8, 3.2] and beta range [0.18, 0.23] (verified: pair-7 E ranges -0.93..-0.95; pair-11 E ranges -3.35..-3.41; pair-13 E ranges +0.96..+1.14). Four dissociation signatures: (1) COALITION-SIZE GRADIENT (pairs 5-12): cue 1 ties, cue 2 picks the TTB winner, and the opposing coalition below cue 2 grows from 1 to 2 to 3 to 7 cues. TTB: P(cue-2 winner) flat at sigmoid(beta). VWEI: monotone decline 0.525 -> 0.468 -> 0.426 -> 0.354, crossing 50% between one and two opponents. (2) COMPOSITION AT FIXED COUNT (pairs 13/14 vs 7/8): exactly two opposing cues, but weak ones (experts 8-9) vs strong ones (experts 3-4). TTB: identical predictions (cue 2 decides in all four; validity-blind). VWEI: an ~11-point gap (0.577 vs 0.468) — this weight-magnitude sensitivity at fixed count falsifies TTB (and any count-based heuristic) while confirming VWEI's amplified log-odds weighting. (3) DECIDING-CUE VALIDITY FLATNESS (pairs 1-4 vs 5-14 vs 15-16): when the 90% expert decides (pairs 1-4, agreement baselines), VWEI predicts P(winner)=0.85-0.89; when the 78% expert decides, ~0.35-0.58; when the 76% expert decides against a 3-cue coalition (pairs 15-16, cascade-depth test), 0.447. TTB predicts the SAME probability in all three regimes — a large cross-family validity effect falsifies TTB, flatness falsifies VWEI. (4) SIGN CONFLICTS: on pairs 7-12 and 15-16 the theories point in OPPOSITE directions (TTB follows cue 2/3; VWEI's evidence sum favors the coalition), so a single trial type can flip a subject's majority choice. Every pair is non-degenerate (a discriminating cue always exists), the design is perfectly side-balanced (8 pairs with TTB winner = A, 8 with TTB winner = B; pairs are exact A/B mirrors), and with 16 unique pairs, K = 96//16 = 6 gives 96 trials and 12 samples per mirrored cell — enough per-subject power to estimate the flat-vs-graded profile that adjudicates the theories. A TTB subject is a horizontal line; a VWEI subject is a specific descending curve that no constant can fit (VWEI's spread 0.89->0.35 exceeds anything TTB's two noise parameters can produce, since TTB has no mechanism for any stimulus-driven variation at all).

[3] NOVEL AXIS (vs. Exps 0-2): a SHALLOW validity gradient with a NEAR-TIE at the top. All prior dissociation designs used a dominant top cue; here the maximum validity is 0.74 and the top two experts differ by only 0.01 (0.74 vs 0.73). This is the sharpest possible probe of TTB's ordinal cascade against VWEI's cardinal weights: TTB commits HARD to the 74% expert whenever it discriminates (a 1-point validity edge produces a full-strength decision), while VWEI's amplified weights for the top two differ by only w1-w2 = 0.16 (at gamma=3), so a single 70% expert (w=0.61) outweighs the entire top-two gap. Validities: [0.74, 0.73, 0.70, 0.69, 0.68, 0.67, 0.66, 0.65, 0.64] (9 experts; weights at gamma=3: 1.145, 0.984, 0.609, 0.512, 0.428, 0.356, 0.292, 0.237, 0.190; no cue can dominate: even all 8 lower weights sum to only 3.61 vs w1=1.145, so coalitions of 2-4 lower cues can override any single cue). 12 base pairs, each exactly A/B-mirrored (24 unique pairs, K=96//24=4, 96 trials, 8 samples per base cell per subject). In every base pair TTB's winner is A, so TTB predicts ONE constant P(A) = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta)+eps/2 on all 12 base pairs (and its complement on mirrors) -- stimulus-invariant by construction. VWEI predicts a specific 25-point graded, anti-symmetric profile (verified robust across the full parameter box gamma in [2.8,3.2], beta in [0.18,0.23]; all evidence signs stable). FOUR QUANTITATIVE SIGNATURES: (1) NEAR-TIE ATTENUATION GRADIENT (pairs 1-8): cue 1 favors A, cue 2 favors B, and the net lower-cue support sweeps from +7 to -7. TTB: flat (cue 1 always decides for A). VWEI: monotone P(A) = 0.636, 0.585, 0.538, 0.508, 0.478, 0.452, 0.429, 0.388 (range across the parameter box: 0.617-0.670 down to 0.380-0.396), crossing 50% between zero and one opposing cue. Any nonzero slope of P(A) on coalition weight falsifies TTB; a flat profile falsifies VWEI. (2) CONTINUITY AT THE VALIDITY TIE (pair 4): the 0.74-vs-0.73 conflict alone. TTB commits fully to A at sigmoid(beta); VWEI predicts 0.508 (range 0.507-0.510) -- statistically a guess -- because a 1-point validity edge is worth only 0.16 evidence units. (3) CASCADE-INVARIANCE VIOLATION (pair 1 vs pair 11): pair 1 is decided by cue 1 with all lower cues congruent; pair 11 is decided by cue 2 (cue 1 ties) with all lower cues opposed. TTB predicts IDENTICAL P(A) on both (first discriminating cue favors A in both; its softmax never sees anything else). VWEI predicts 0.636 vs 0.420 -- a 22-point gap in opposite directions of deviation that no constant can fit. Similarly pair 8 vs 11 (0.388 vs 0.420) shows TTB-equivalent pairs differing by deciding-cue identity. (4) SIGN CONFLICTS: on 7 of 12 base pairs (5-8, 10-12) VWEI predicts a B-majority (P(A) = 0.388-0.478) where TTB predicts an A-majority; majority-B choices there directly falsify TTB at any beta (TTB's winner probability is always >= 0.5). Family C (pair 12) additionally tests deep-cascade skipping: cues 1-3 all tie, cue 4 decides for A against a 5-cue coalition; TTB says A at the same constant; VWEI says 0.451. Because TTB's prediction on this entire design is a single stimulus-invariant constant (plus its mirror), VWEI's 25-point stimulus-driven spread -- spanning both sides of 50% with a specific monotone shape -- is a profile no TTB parameterization can approximate, while every VWEI prediction is sign-robust across its entire parameter box. All pairs are non-degenerate (every pair has discriminating cues; no all-tie pairs; no pair where both theories guess), the design is perfectly side-balanced (12 TTB-winner-A, 12 TTB-winner-B), and every trial requires actually comparing the two rating vectors.

[4] NOVEL AXIS (vs. Exps 0-3): ZERO-WEIGHT EXPERTS. All prior designs dissociated theories that all read endorsements as positive evidence. SDI versus VWEI is a clash of SIGN and of WEIGHTING PROFILE: SDI treats every endorsement as a liability (penalty d_j = (1-v_j)^delta, nearly uniform at ~0.86-1.0 across the whole validity range for delta in [0, 0.05]) and prefers the option with FEWER endorsements; VWEI weights endorsements by amplified log-odds (w_j = logit(v_j)^gamma, enormous spread: 25.5 at v=.95 down to 0.61 at v=.70) and prefers the option with MORE validity-weighted wins. The design's keystone is four experts at validity EXACTLY 0.50: VWEI's weight for a 50% expert is logit(0.5)^gamma = 0 for EVERY gamma — a 50% expert's endorsement is structurally invisible to VWEI under any parameterization — while SDI's skepticism weight is (1-0.5)^delta in [0.966, 1], its NEAR-MAXIMUM penalty. A coin-flip expert's praise is, for SDI, a full unit of suspicion. Validities: [0.95, 0.90, 0.85, 0.80, 0.75, 0.70, 0.50, 0.50, 0.50, 0.50] (10 experts; VWEI weights at gamma=3: 25.5, 10.6, 5.2, 2.7, 1.3, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0; SDI penalty weights at delta=0.025: 0.93, 0.94, 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.97, 0.98, 0.98, 0.98, 0.98). 16 base pairs, each exactly A/B-mirrored (32 unique pairs, K = 96//32 = 3, 96 trials, 6 samples per base cell per subject). In every base pair VWEI's winner is A, so the design is perfectly side-balanced. FOUR QUANTITATIVE SIGNATURES (P(A) at SDI mid-params delta=.025, beta=1, eps=.115, alpha=.025; VWEI mid-params gamma=3, beta=.205, eps=.015; all signs verified robust across the FULL parameter boxes): (1) JUNK-ENDORSEMENT GRADIENT, VWEI STRUCTURALLY FLAT (pairs 1-5): the 95% expert endorses A; k = 0..4 of the 50% experts also endorse A. VWEI: E = 25.5 regardless of k (50% weight is exactly 0 at any gamma), so P(A) is flat at 0.98-0.99. SDI: each junk endorsement adds ~0.98 penalty units to A, so P(A) declines monotonone 0.32 -> 0.18 -> 0.11 -> 0.08 -> 0.06 (~6-7 points per junk endorsement; box ranges 0.32-0.33 down to 0.05-0.08). ANY measurable effect of 50%-expert endorsements on choice falsifies VWEI outright — it has no mechanism, at any gamma, beta, or epsilon, for a zero-weight cue to move its prediction off a constant; flatness at ~0.99 with no decline falsifies SDI. Pairs 6-7 run the mirror logic (junk endorsements on B): VWEI flat 0.99; SDI rises 0.53 -> 0.72 as B accumulates 'suspicion'. (2) OPPOSITE-SLOPE DOUBLE DISSOCIATION (pairs 10-14): cue 1 (95%) endorses A while the opposing coalition among cues 2-6 grows from 1 to 5. VWEI: E = 25.5 - cumulative weight, so P(A) DECLINES 0.95 -> 0.87 -> 0.81 -> 0.76 -> 0.74. SDI: each opposing endorsement adds a penalty to B, so P(A) RISES 0.51 -> 0.69 -> 0.82 -> 0.89 -> 0.92. The two profiles are anti-correlated and CROSS between k=2 and k=3 — slope signs are parameter-independent (VWEI's E strictly decreases in k because every added cue has positive weight; SDI's D strictly increases because every added endorsement adds positive penalty), so the sign of the empirical slope across this 5-point gradient adjudicates the theories with no free parameters able to reverse it. (3) SIGN CONFLICT AT CEILING (pairs 8-9, plus mirrors 24-25): A endorsed by 3 (then 5) high-validity experts, B by none. VWEI: P(A) ~ 0.99. SDI: P(A) = 0.12 (3 endorsements) falling to 0.07 (5 endorsements) — majority choices OPPOSITE to VWEI on stimuli where VWEI is at ceiling, which is SDI's novel falsifiable prediction (high-validity option carrying MORE endorsements). SDI additionally predicts a within-family decline (0.12 -> 0.07) where VWEI is flat at ceiling. (4) VALIDITY-BLINDNESS AT MATCHED ENDORSEMENT COUNTS (pairs 15-16): exactly one endorsement per option, varying expert identity (95% vs 70%; 90% vs 70%). SDI: P(A) = 0.51-0.52 regardless — its penalty weights span only ~9% across the entire validity range at delta <= 0.05, so at matched counts SDI is essentially indifferent to WHO endorses (its only tilt, +1-2 points toward the higher-validity endorser, comes from delta and the alpha tie-break). VWEI: 0.99 and 0.88 — a 40+ point sensitivity to expert identity that SDI cannot produce under any delta in [0, 0.05]. No pair is degenerate: every pair has discriminating cues, no pair leaves both theories guessing (the closest SDI gets to 0.5 is on D-1/E pairs where VWEI is at 0.88-0.95), and every pair requires actually comparing the two rating vectors. The conjunction is un-fakeable in both directions: a VWEI subject is a flat line at ~0.99 across the entire junk gradient and a declining line across the coalition gradient; an SDI subject is a specific descending curve on junk endorsements, a specific ascending curve on opposing coalitions, near-50% at matched counts, and B-majorities on the ceiling-conflict pairs. Neither theory's parameter box can approximate the other's profile because the key contrasts (zero vs. near-maximal weight on 50% experts; fewer- vs. more-endorsements preference) are structural, not parametric.

[5] NOVEL AXIS (vs. Exps 0-4): a CARDINAL WEIGHT-MATCHING RIDGE built from duplicate moderate validities, with no zero-validity experts and no dominant top cue. Exp 4 dissociated VWEI from SDI structurally (50% experts are invisible to VWEI, penalized by SDI) and via 95%-anchored ceiling conflicts. This design instead engineers trials where VWEI's evidence sum is arithmetically pinned to ~0 by matching coalitions of moderate experts against single stronger experts, and dual trials where SDI's penalty difference is pinned to ~0 by matching endorsement counts. The validities [0.90, 0.85, 0.80, 0.80, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.65, 0.60] are chosen so that VWEI's amplified log-odds weights satisfy 2*w(0.75) = w(0.80) exactly at gamma = ln2/ln(1.2616) = 2.98 and 4*w(0.75) = w(0.85) exactly at gamma = ln4/ln(1.579) = 3.03 -- both crossing points sit at the CENTER of VWEI's own gamma box [2.8, 3.2], so the weight-matching holds (|E| <= 0.53, hence P within +/-2.5 points of 0.50) across the ENTIRE parameter box, verified at gamma in {2.8, 3.0, 3.2} x beta in {0.18, 0.23}. 12 base pairs, each exactly A/B-mirrored (24 unique pairs, K = 96//24 = 4, 96 trials, 8 samples per base cell per subject), perfectly side-balanced. FAMILY 1 -- EVIDENCE-MATCHED COUNT GRADIENT (pairs 1-5): one option carries 1 (or 2) endorsements, the other carries a weight-matched coalition of 2-4 moderate experts (e.g., A = {85%} vs B = {80%, 75%, 75%}: E = 5.22 - 5.32 = -0.10). VWEI is pinned at chance: P(fewer-endorsement option) = 0.49-0.50 on all five pairs (box range 0.48-0.52) -- it has no mechanism, at any gamma/beta/epsilon in its box, for these stimuli to move it off a guess, because its cardinal weights cancel by construction. SDI climbs monotonically with endorsement-count difference: 0.69 (1v2), 0.70 (1v2, second realization), 0.83 (1v3), 0.83 (2v4), 0.89 (1v4) (box ranges 0.65-0.73 up to 0.86-0.92), since every net endorsement adds ~0.96 penalty units and its D strictly increases with count difference -- the slope sign is parameter-independent. Any systematic departure from 50% toward the fewer-endorsement option on pairs 1-5 falsifies VWEI; flatness at 50% falsifies SDI. FAMILY 2 -- COUNT-MATCHED VALIDITY-GAP GRADIENT (pairs 6-9): exactly one endorsement per side, with the endorser validity gap shrinking (.90 vs .60; .85 vs .65; .85 vs .80; .80 vs .75). SDI is pinned at 0.50-0.52 on all four (its penalty weights (1-v)^delta span <5% across the whole validity range at delta <= 0.05, and the alpha tie-break adds at most 3 points) -- structurally near-blind to WHO endorses at matched counts. VWEI sweeps 0.89 -> 0.73 -> 0.62 -> 0.56 (box ranges 0.84-0.95 down to 0.55-0.59), a 33-point monotone gradient in endorser validity that no SDI parameterization can produce. FAMILY 3 -- SIGN CONFLICT AT THE RIDGE CREST (pair 10): four 75% experts (total weight 5.30) vs one 80% expert (weight 2.66). VWEI: majority for the 4-endorsement coalition, P(A) = 0.63 (box 0.61-0.65). SDI: majority for the single endorsement, P(A) = 0.10 (box 0.08-0.12) -- opposite majorities, both far from chance, sign-robust across both boxes. BASELINE/SUB-RIDGE (pairs 11-12): pair 11 ({90%} vs {65%, 60%}) is the one agreement cell (VWEI 0.89, SDI 0.71 -- both prefer A, calibrating each theory's scale where they concur); pair 12 ({80%, 75%} vs {85%}) sits just BELOW the matching ridge (VWEI 0.43, SDI 0.30 -- both prefer B but at parametrically distinct depths, gap >= 9 points across boxes). THE DOUBLE DISSOCIATION IS UN-FAKEABLE: the two theories are placed in orthogonal indifference regimes -- VWEI is indifferent exactly when endorsement counts differ at matched evidence (Family 1), SDI is indifferent exactly when counts match but validity composition differs (Family 2) -- and no reparameterization of either theory can escape its own indifference condition (VWEI's weights cancel by arithmetic fixed at gamma ~ 3; SDI's penalty weights are count-driven and validity-flat by delta <= 0.05). A VWEI subject is a flat 50% line across the entire count gradient and a steep monotone curve across the gap gradient; an SDI subject is a steep monotone climb across the count gradient and a flat ~51% line across the gap gradient, plus a strong majority for the single endorser on pair 10 where VWEI favors the coalition. All pairs are non-degenerate (every pair has discriminating cues; no all-tie pairs; no pair leaves both theories guessing), and every trial requires actually comparing the two rating vectors.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — theories that depend on validity order re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) make many candidate theories indistinguishable, so spread them out.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended theories be dissociated; avoid trials where every theory agrees.

  "rationale": "NOVEL AXIS (vs. Exps 0-5): the first head-to-head between the two DEFECT-INTEGRATION theories. SDI and VPS agree that every endorsement is a liability, but they disagree about the WEIGHT PROFILE attached to the endorser's validity: SDI's skepticism weight (1-v)^delta is nearly FLAT across the whole validity range (0.86-0.98 at delta <= 0.05, a <14% spread; at delta=0 exactly flat), so SDI is essentially a validity-blind endorsement COUNTER; VPS's weight c0 + c1*v^kappa INCREASES steeply in validity (a 0.95 expert's endorsement costs ~2.9x a 0.50 expert's at mid parameters), so VPS actively prefers options endorsed by WEAKER experts. The design places the two theories in orthogonal indifference regimes: SDI is pinned at chance exactly when endorsement counts match but validity composition differs; VPS is pinned at (near) chance exactly when counts differ but its validity-scaled penalties cancel. Validities (15 experts): [0.95, 0.90, 0.90, 0.90, 0.85, 0.80, 0.65, 0.60, 0.60, 0.60, 0.55, 0.50, 0.50, 0.50, 0.50] -- duplicates are required to build coalitions; the spread 0.50-0.95 spans the full range. 12 base pairs, each exactly A/B-mirrored (24 unique pairs, K = 96//24 = 4, 96 trials, 8 samples per base cell per subject), perfectly side-balanced. All predictions below are given as P(A) at SDI mid-params (delta=.025, beta=1, eps=.115, alpha=.025) and VPS mid-params (kappa=2, beta=2, eps=.10, c0=.1, c1=1), with full-box ranges verified sign-robust. FAMILY 1 -- VALIDITY-GAP LADDER AT MATCHED COUNTS (pairs 1-5): 1v1 pairs with shrinking endorser gaps (.95/.50, .90/.55, .85/.60, .80/.65) plus the doubled 2v2 max-gap pair (.95+.90 vs .55+.50). VPS predicts a monotone ladder BELOW 50%: 0.24, 0.29, 0.34, 0.40, 0.13 -- it always prefers the LOWER-validity endorser, structurally (its penalty is strictly increasing in v for any c1>0, so D<0 at matched counts for EVERY parameterization). SDI is pinned at 0.51 +/- 0.02 (box 0.50-0.56): its penalty weights vary <14% and its only tilt, the alpha<=0.05 tie-break, pushes TOWARD the high-validity endorser -- i.e., AWAY from VPS's prediction, so no SDI parameterization can mimic the ladder. A monotone descending P(A) in gap falsifies SDI; a flat ~0.51 line falsifies VPS. FAMILY 2 -- SIGN CONFLICTS, OPPOSITE MAJORITIES (pairs 6-8): (a) 3x0.50 vs 2x0.90: VPS 0.79 (box 0.60-0.90) vs SDI 0.26 (box 0.24-0.30); (b) 4x0.50 vs 3x0.90: VPS 0.89 (box 0.75-0.93) vs SDI 0.25 (box 0.26-0.31); (c) 2x0.90 vs 3x0.60: VPS 0.31 (box 0.17-0.45) vs SDI 0.72 (box 0.68-0.75). Every conflict is sign-robust across BOTH entire parameter boxes (e.g., pair 6: VPS D = -c0 + c1(2*0.9^kappa - 3*0.5^kappa) > 0 always since c0/c1 <= 0.214 < 0.700; pair 8: D < 0 always since c0/c1 <= 0.214 < 0.365). A single majority choice on any conflict cell adjudicates the theories with no free parameters able to reverse it. FAMILY 3 -- JUNK-COUNT GRADIENT VS FIXED 2x0.90 (pairs 9, 10, 6): k = 1, 2, 3 endorsements from 50% experts on A against the same two 90% endorsements on B. SDI declines 0.66 -> 0.45 -> 0.26, CROSSING 50% between k=1 and k=2 (each junk endorsement adds ~0.97 penalty units; crossing at count parity is structural). VPS declines only 0.91 -> 0.86 -> 0.79 and does NOT cross through k=3, because each 0.50 endorsement costs only ~0.35 penalty units vs ~0.91 for a 0.90 endorsement -- it takes ~2.5 junk endorsements to offset one 90% endorsement for VPS but only 1 for SDI. The LOCATION OF THE CROSSING POINT is the quantitative signature. FAMILY 4 -- INDIFFERENCE ASYMMETRY (pairs 11-12): pair 11 (one 0.90 vs two 0.60s) is engineered so 2*0.6^kappa ~= 0.9^kappa (within 0.04-0.19 across kappa in [1.6, 2.4]), with the c0 count term partially cancelling the residual: VPS's D ranges only [-0.20, +0.20] over its ENTIRE box, keeping P(A) in [0.40, 0.61] (mid 0.50) -- near chance -- while SDI delivers a clear majority, P(A) = 0.70 (box 0.65-0.71), because B carries one extra endorsement. Pair 12 (3x0.90 vs 2x0.50) is the floor test: both theories prefer B, but SDI only moderately (P(A) = 0.35, box 0.28-0.42) while VPS is pinned at the floor (P(A) = 0.07, box 0.04-0.10) -- a 25+-point magnitude gap where sign cannot adjudicate. THE DISSOCIATION IS UN-FAKEABLE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: a VPS subject is a descending ladder in Family 1 (all rungs < 0.47), stays above 0.60 through k=3 in Family 3, and sits at chance on pair 11; an SDI subject is a flat ~0.51 line across the entire ladder (its alpha tie-break can only push it ABOVE 0.5, opposite to VPS), crosses 50% at k=2 in Family 3, and shows a 0.70 majority on pair 11. Because SDI's stimulus-driven variation at matched counts is bounded by alpha*delta-logit <= 0.25 penalty units while VPS's ladder spans D in [-1.6, -0.41], and because VPS's indifference on pair 11 is arithmetic (2*0.6^kappa ~= 0.9^kappa across its kappa box) while SDI's count signal there is a full penalty unit, neither theory's parameter box can approximate the other's profile. All pairs are non-degenerate (every pair has discriminating endorsements, no all-tie pairs, no pair where both theories guess -- the closest, pair 11, is precisely the cell where they maximally diverge), and every trial requires actually comparing the two rating vectors.",
