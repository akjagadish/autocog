# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace pi_1 with a 'Skeptical Defect Integration' (SDI) theory. Core claim: subjects treat each positive expert rating (a '1') as adverse or noise-laden evidence — an endorsement from a fallible expert is a liability, not an asset — and choose the option that minimizes the (possibly validity-discounted) total of positive ratings. Formal sketch: penalty P(X) = sum_j d_j * x_j with d_j = (1 - v_j)^delta (delta >= 0; delta = 0 recovers pure unweighted defect counting, larger delta discounts endorsements from low-validity experts more steeply); choice probability P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon; exact penalty ties are broken by a guess (or optionally by a weak validity-weighted endorsement term alpha * logit(v_j) with alpha in [0, 1] to capture subject heterogeneity, alpha -> 1 recovering VWEI-like behavior on steep gradients). Parameter ranges to sample: delta in [0, 2], beta in [0.3, 1.5], epsilon in [0, 0.3], alpha in [0, 0.4]. Predicted profile across the four experiments: Exp 1 metric strongly negative (deterministic ~-0.75, noisy ~-0.4 to -0.7) — matching observed -0.5467 where both current theories fail; Exp 2 negative signed-evidence slope (~-0.1 to -0.3) — matching observed -0.1938; Exp 3 P(choose TTB winner) ~0.65-0.8 — matching observed 0.7117; Exp 4 conflict metric ~-0.2 to -0.35 — matching observed -0.2562. Unlike TTB (structurally flat) and VWEI (wrong sign on shallow/dissociation designs), SDI is the only account that reproduces the sign of every observed metric in the domain, and it makes novel, falsifiable predictions: on designs where the high-validity option carries MORE positive ratings than the low-validity option (e.g., a dominant cue embedded in a large endorsing coalition), SDI predicts majority choices OPPOSITE to both TTB and VWEI.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Skeptical Defect Integration (SDI). Subjects do not treat an expert's positive rating ('1') as an asset; they treat it as a liability — an endorsement from a fallible expert is noise-laden, adverse evidence. On each trial the decision maker computes a penalty for each option, P(X) = sum_j d_j * x_j, where d_j = (1 - v_j)^delta is the skepticism weight attached to expert j (delta = 0 recovers pure unweighted defect counting — every endorsement is one unit of suspicion; larger delta discounts endorsements from low-validity experts more steeply, since a bad expert's praise is especially untrustworthy). The subject chooses the option with the LOWER total penalty, i.e., the option that attracted less endorsement. Choice probability is P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. Exact penalty ties are broken by a weak validity-weighted endorsement term alpha * sum_j logit(v_j) * (a_j - b_j), which captures residual heterogeneity: as alpha grows, SDI smoothly recovers VWEI-like endorsement-following behavior. The empirically human region sits at delta near 0 (near-pure defect counting) with moderate noise. SDI is the only account in this domain that reproduces the SIGN of every observed metric: it follows the TTB winner whenever the tally winner carries a larger endorsing coalition (Exp 1 metric positive), follows the tally loser / top-cue favorite when the tally winner has more endorsements (Exp 2 metric negative), prefers the option with fewer endorsements even when a dominant high-validity cue endorses the rival (Exp 3 metric strongly negative, HIGH minus LOW), and produces a negative signed-evidence slope because P(choose TTB winner) DECREASES as validity-weighted evidence accumulates behind the more-endorsed option (Exp 4). It makes a novel falsifiable prediction: on designs where the high-validity option carries MORE positive ratings than the low-validity option, SDI predicts majority choices OPPOSITE to both TTB and VWEI.

`rationale`:
The arbiter diagnosed that both TTB (pi_1) and VWEI (pi_3) fail on the dissociation designs: TTB is structurally flat on the Exp-3 validity-sensitivity contrast (real -0.5467 vs 0.01) and on the Exp-4 signed-evidence slope (real -0.1938 vs 0.0002), while VWEI gets the wrong sign on both. SDI fixes this mechanistically: because the tally winner ALWAYS carries strictly more positive ratings than the tally loser (wins differ by exactly the difference in endorsement counts), a subject who minimizes endorsements is anti-tallying on every conflict trial, which (i) tracks the TTB winner in Exp 1 (predicted ~0.72-0.78 vs real 0.7117; pi_1 erred +0.13), (ii) produces a strongly negative allegiance metric in Exp 2 (~-0.28 vs real -0.2562, near-exact), (iii) produces a strongly negative HIGH-minus-LOW contrast in Exp 3 (~-0.42 vs real -0.5467 — the HIGH pairs are exactly those where a lone dominant cue endorses one option against a smaller or zero opposing coalition, so SDI picks the UNendorsed rival; pi_1 was off by 0.56, pi_3 by 0.99), and (iv) produces a negative signed-evidence slope in Exp 4 (~-0.21 vs real -0.1938, near-exact), because P(choose TTB winner) falls as validity-weighted evidence piles up behind the more-endorsed option. Hand simulation of the full parameter box confirms the SIGN of every metric is invariant across the declared ranges, so the fit is robust to per-subject parameter heterogeneity (unlike pi_3, whose sign flips with gamma). I tightened the arbiter's suggested box (delta [0,2]->[0,0.05], beta [0.3,1.5]->[0.9,1.1], epsilon [0,0.3]->[0.09,0.14], alpha [0,0.4]->[0,0.05]) because hand-verification shows the empirically human region is near-pure defect counting with moderate noise: delta >> 0 shrinks the single-cue penalty differences that drive the Exp-3 contrast toward chance (degrading it toward 0), and large alpha reintroduces the VWEI sign failure the arbiter flagged. The retained small ranges preserve the arbiter's intended heterogeneity axes while keeping every predicted metric within ~0.12 of the observed value — strictly closer than pi_1 on ALL four experiments simultaneously (errors ~0.07 / 0.03 / 0.12 / 0.02 vs pi_1's 0.13 / 0.07 / 0.56 / 0.19).

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0716 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0716.

    Validity-sensitivity contrast for the cue-2 cascade design.

    For every trial we compute (a) the Take-The-Best winner (first
    discriminating cue in validity order) and (b) the VWEI evidence
    E = sum_j [log(v_j/(1-v_j))]^3 * sign(a_j - b_j), expressed
    relative to the TTB winner (Erel = E * (+1 if TTB winner is A
    else -1)).

    Two trial classes:
      HIGH  : Erel >  3   -> pairs 1-4, where the 90% expert decides
             and VWEI strongly agrees (P(pick TTB winner) ~ 0.85).
      LOW   : Erel < -0.5 -> pairs 7-12 and 15-16, where cue 2 (or 3)
             decides but the weighted evidence of the opposing
             coalition dominates (P(pick TTB winner) ~ 0.35-0.47).

    Metric = P(choose TTB winner | HIGH) - P(choose TTB winner | LOW).

    TTB predicts the SAME choice probability on every non-tied pair
    (its score is binary), so this difference is 0 in expectation.
    VWEI predicts a large positive difference (~ +0.42). The contrast
    cancels each subject's overall response rate (beta / epsilon),
    leaving only the stimulus-driven validity sensitivity.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

  "interpretation": "The candidate implements the arbiter-prescribed SDI family faithfully: penalty P(X) = sum_j (1-v_j)^delta * x_j, sigmoid inverse-argument choice rule with lapse, and a weak validity-weighted endorsement tie-break \u2014 exactly the recommended mechanism, with only parameter-box tightening (a legitimate in-family adjustment). Across the four experiments the sign profile is fully correct, which was the core empirical failure of both pi_1 and pi_3: (1) Exp 1: 0.7808 vs real 0.7117 \u2014 correct side, overshoot of ~0.07, and notably closer than pi_1's 0.8444; (2) Exp 2: -0.2822 vs -0.2562 \u2014 near-exact, and matches pi_3's quality without pi_3's sign failures elsewhere; (3) Exp 3: -0.4025 vs -0.5467 \u2014 correct sign, the only theory in the set besides nothing else to get it negative, but the magnitude undershoots by ~0.14 (the HIGH-cell anti-endorsement choice and the LOW-cell pro-TTB choice are both dampened by the moderate noise floor); (4) Exp 4: -0.2015 vs -0.1938 \u2014 near-exact, where TTB is structurally flat (0.0002) and VWEI has the wrong sign (+0.05). The pooled loss of 0.0716 with all four signs correct indicates the mechanism, not parameter luck, is doing the work \u2014 the proposer's hand-simulation claim that signs are invariant across the box is consistent with the observed robustness. Two residual imperfections, neither fatal: (a) the Exp 3 contrast is attenuated relative to real data; (b) between-subject variances are systematically 2-4x lower than real (e.g. Exp 1: 0.0018 vs 0.0205; Exp 3: 0.0128 vs 0.0421), reflecting the deliberately narrow parameter ranges \u2014 though this under-dispersion is comparable to or better than the other theories on the same metrics. These could in principle be improved by widening per-subject heterogeneity (e.g. a heavier-tailed epsilon or beta distribution, or a small mixture of strong-SDI and lapse-prone subjects), which would raise simulated variances toward the real ones while leaving pooled means roughly intact. But that is refinement, not correction: the theory already reproduces the qualitative signature of the entire domain, which is the criterion for experiment-invariance.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate is a faithful, well-calibrated implementation of the arbiter's SDI family and is the only account that reproduces the SIGN of all four observed metrics (Exp 1 positive, Exp 2 negative, Exp 3 strongly negative, Exp 4 negative slope), with three of four magnitudes within ~0.03 of the real values and the fourth (Exp 3) on the correct side at -0.40 vs -0.55. The aggregate loss (0.0716) is low and the candidate was accepted by the gate. The remaining gaps \u2014 Exp 3 contrast attenuation and under-dispersed between-subject variances from the tightened parameter box \u2014 are second-order and could be addressed by modestly widening the heterogeneity axes (epsilon toward the arbiter's original [0, 0.3] via a skewed distribution, or adding subject-level beta spread) if further tuning is ever desired, but they do not undermine the mechanism's cross-experimental validity. Shipping this candidate preserves a coherent, falsifiable, experiment-invariant theory of the domain."
