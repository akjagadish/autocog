# generation_iter_01_attempt_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 (VPS) with a new theory — 'Graded Dual-Route Distrust (GDRD)' — designed as a stronger competitor to SVD rather than a re-fit of it. Core proposal: (1) ROUTE 1 (analytic distrust): retain the liability score P(X) = sum_j x_j * (c0 + c1 * v_j^kappa), kappa >= 1, penalty increasing in claimed validity — this is required by Exps 5-7, 10, 11 (top-cue avoidance at 0.114, matched-count low-validity coalition preference at 0.78-0.81, validity-composition sensitivity at 0.37). (2) ROUTE 2 (soft counting): replace SVD's deterministic fewer-endorsement step with a CONTINUOUS count preference, P_count(A) = sigmoid(gamma * (cnt_B - cnt_A)), where gamma is a per-subject slope sampled from a WIDE range (including near-zero). This single change does double duty: at large gamma it reproduces SVD's compression on saturated conflict cells (Exps 1, 2, 9: targets 0.79, 0.83, 0.38) that VPS could not produce at any parameterization, while at small gamma it yields the near-chance coin-flip tolerance of Exp 12 (observed 0.5096, where BOTH current theories overpredict at 0.55/0.61) and can absorb SVD's residual overpredictions on Exps 3 and 8. (3) MIXTURE: P_core(A) = w * sigmoid(beta*(pen_B - pen_A)) + (1-w) * sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B - cnt_A)), with w in [0.5, 0.95] per subject. (4) HETEROGENEITY: beta, gamma, w, and lapse epsilon all sampled per subject from wide ranges (epsilon up to ~0.25), so the population mixture naturally generates the intermediate saturation levels (0.78-0.83 rather than 0.95) and the large between-subject variances observed on Exps 1 and 2 (0.054, 0.044) that both current theories underestimate by an order of magnitude — a second, independent empirical failure of VPS's narrow box. (5) Optional micro-trust term alpha*logit(v_j) with alpha in [0, small] to capture the residual validity-following on Exp 8's big-gap single-endorser cells (observed composite 0.1925 sits between VPS 0.186 and SVD 0.231). The new theory is falsifiable against SVD on the count-parity staircase assays: SVD predicts a discrete step of exactly (1-w)(1-eps)/2 at parity crossings, GDRD predicts a smooth sigmoid ramp in count difference — Experiments 1-2's staircase families adjudicate this directly.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.889)

**Description**
Softened Validity-Distrust with Count Mixture (SVD). Every expert endorsement is a liability whose magnitude increases monotonically in the endorser's RAW claimed validity: d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa, with no dampening near v=0.5 and no trust refund. Decision making is a dual-process mixture at the trial level: with probability w the subject is a 'skeptic' who integrates the accumulated-suspicion difference D = P(B) - P(A) through sigmoid(beta*D); with probability (1-w) the subject is a 'counter' who simply chooses the option with FEWER total endorsements (indifferent at matched counts). Two heterogeneity mechanisms soften the pooled extremes and capture between-subject variability: (i) the sigmoid slope beta is sampled from a WIDE per-subject range, so the population is a mixture of shallow and steep sigmoids — sensitive near D=0 (matched-count validity-composition trials) yet compressed at large |D| (unequal-count trials); (ii) the uniform lapse epsilon is also sampled from a wide per-subject range, which pulls every saturated large-D assay toward 0.5 while adding genuine between-subject dispersion in overall choice rates.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.707)

**Description**
Validity-Proportional Skepticism (VPS), a.k.a. Confidence-Distrust Defect Integration. Subjects treat every expert endorsement not as an asset but as a liability whose magnitude scales with the endorser's claimed validity: a highly valid expert's praise is a strong claim, and strong claims attract the most suspicion. On each trial the decision maker computes a penalty for each option, P(X) = sum_j x_j * (c0 + c1 * v_j^kappa), where c0 is a flat defect-count term (c1 = 0 recovers pure unweighted defect counting) and c1 * v_j^kappa is the confidence-distrust term, with penalty INCREASING in the endorser's validity and kappa controlling how steeply. The subject chooses the lower-penalty option via P(A) = sigmoid(beta * (P(B) - P(A))) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. History is ignored because validities are communicated in the instructions, so skepticism weights are fixed for the whole block. VPS reproduces the sign of every observed metric while fixing the one structural blind spot of pure defect counting (SDI): on matched-count trials with a large validity gap (e.g., a single 0.90 endorser vs a single 0.60 endorser), SDI is pinned at 0.5 while VPS predicts a clear majority for the LOWER-validity endorser — exactly what the Experiment 6 composite (observed 0.193) requires.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.571)

**Description**
Dampened Confidence-Distrust Integration (DCD). Every expert endorsement is treated as a liability whose magnitude grows with the endorser's claimed validity: a highly valid expert's praise is a strong claim, and strong claims attract the most suspicion. The per-endorsement distrust charge is d_j = c0 + c1*(2*v_j - 1)^kappa, where the (2v-1) rescaling DAMPENS the charge near chance validity (a 55% expert's endorsement costs barely more than a coin flip's, i.e. only the flat baseline c0) while remaining steeply increasing toward confident experts. Two additions repair the incumbents' failures: (i) a large flat charge c0 preserves pure endorsement-count avoidance, so when the low-validity option carries MORE endorsements the count signal can overcome validity-distrust (the count-conflict cells where VPS is wrong); (ii) a small residual validity-weighted trust term alpha * sum_j logit(v_j)*(a_j - b_j) captures residual endorsement-following that pulls matched-count choices back toward and slightly past chance in the direction of the higher-validity endorser (softening VPS's extremes). The decision variable is D = (P(B) - P(A)) + alpha * sum_j logit(v_j)*(a_j - b_j), where P(X) = sum_j x_j*d_j is the accumulated suspicion for option X; the subject chooses via P(A) = sigmoid(beta*D) mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. History is ignored because validities are communicated in the instructions, so distrust weights are fixed for the whole block. DCD nests VPS as a limiting case (alpha -> 0, rescaling absorbed) and SDI as another (c1 -> 0), while filling the empirically human region between them.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0409 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0409 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

    TTB's probability of choosing its own winner is a single constant

**Metric**
```python

    #
    # The 15 experts split into a HIGH-validity group (features 0-6:
    # validities 0.95, 0.90, 0.90, 0.90, 0.85, 0.80, 0.65) and a
    # LOW-validity group (features 7-14: validity 0.60). Every trial in
    # this design pits a "pure high" option against a "pure low"
    # option. Two families of cells separate SDI from VPS:
    #
    # Family 1 (matched endorsement counts, validity gap): SDI's
    #   penalty is a near-flat function of validity (delta ~ 0), so it
    #   is pinned at ~0.51 for the high-validity option (its weak
    #   alpha tie-break even pushes slightly ABOVE 0.5). VPS's
    #   penalty rises steeply in validity, so it systematically picks
    #   the LOW-validity option (~0.28).
    #
    # Family 2 (count conflict where the FEWER-endorsed option is the
    #   high-validity one): SDI follows the endorsement count and
    #   picks the high-validity option (~0.72). VPS's validity-scaled
    #   distrust makes the low-validity majority cheaper, so it picks
    #   the high-validity option only ~0.30 of the time.
    #
    # The metric is the average of P(choose the high-validity-group
    #   option) over these two families. SDI predicts ~0.62; VPS
    #   predicts ~0.29.

    # On trials where A and B carry the SAME number of endorsements (k vs k),
    # the two theories make opposite-sign predictions:
    #   VPS: the coalition of LOWER-validity endorsers is preferred
    #        (a high-validity endorsement is a bigger suspected defect),
    #        with preference strengthening in k.
    #   SDI: at matched count its validity sensitivity has the wrong sign
    #        and is bounded, so it stays at or below chance for the
    #        low-validity coalition on every such trial.
    #
    # The metric is the empirical proportion of choices of the
    # LOW-validity coalition across all matched-count trials
    # (design pairs 1-6 and their A/B mirrors 13-18; 48 of the 96
    # trials per subject). VPS predicts ~0.85; SDI predicts ~0.45.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # COIN-FLIP ENDORSEMENT TOLERANCE.
    #
    # For every trial, count how many endorsements each option receives
    # from the five chance-validity (v = 0.50) experts (feature indices
    # 15-19 in this experiment's fixed validity vector). Every one of the
    # 24 unique pairs pits an option carrying coin-flip endorsements
    # against an option carrying none, so the trial is scored:
    #   1.0  if the subject chose the option with MORE 0.50-expert
    #        endorsements (the 'coin-flip tolerant' choice),
    #   0.0  otherwise.
    # The metric is the mean of this score over all trials.
    #
    # This is a direct assay of the one structural difference between the
    # two confidence-distrust theories: the geometry of the per-endorsement
    # distrust charge. VPS charges c0 + c1*v^kappa, so a 0.50 endorsement
    # still costs a substantial c1*0.25-0.33 distrust units and the
    # internal exchange rate between mid-validity (0.75) endorsements and
    # coin-flips is ~1.9 coin-flips per 0.75. DCD charges
    # c0 + c1*(2v-1)^kappa, which collapses to the bare floor c0 at
    # v = 0.50 (and refunds part of the 0.75 charge via the residual trust
    # term), yielding an exchange rate of only ~1.3. Hence VPS subjects
    # are systematically MORE willing to accept coin-flip endorsements,
    # across every cell family in the design:
    #   composition cells (mixed {v_hi, 0.50} vs homogeneous mid): VPS
    #     picks the mixed side (0.53-0.59), DCD avoids it (0.33-0.45);
    #   exchange cells (0.75-coalition vs k coin-flips): VPS keeps
    #     choosing the coin-flip side through k=3-4, DCD abandons it;
    #   calibration cells ({0.90} vs {0.50}, {0.50,0.50} vs {0.90,0.90}):
    #     VPS 0.73/0.86 vs DCD 0.65/0.76.
    # Mid-parameter predictions: VPS ~0.59, DCD ~0.45 (disjoint across
    # their full parameter boxes), with per-subject SD ~0.05-0.06 from
    # 96 Bernoulli trials.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Graded Dual-Route Distrust (GDRD). Subjects evaluate expert endorsements through two concurrent routes blended per trial. ROUTE 1 (analytic distrust): every endorsement is a liability whose magnitude grows monotonically in the endorser's RAW claimed validity, d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa (kappa >= 1); the accumulated suspicion P(X) = sum_j x_j*d_j is compared across options through a sigmoid, sigmoid(beta*(P(B)-P(A))), with slope beta sampled per subject from a wide range (a population mixture of shallow and steep sigmoids). A small residual micro-trust term alpha*sum_j logit(v_j)*(a_j - b_j) captures residual validity-following: a highly valid expert's endorsement is mostly suspicion but not entirely. ROUTE 2 (graded counting): instead of a deterministic fewer-endorsement rule, the subject has a CONTINUOUS count preference sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B - cnt_A)) with per-subject slope gamma. The final choice probability is P_core(A) = w*sigmoid(beta*D) + (1-w)*sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B - cnt_A)), mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. Because the count route is a smooth ramp rather than a step, GDRD makes a falsifiable prediction orthogonal to SVD: at count-parity crossings the choice probability ramps continuously in the count difference with slope gamma, rather than jumping by a discrete (1-w)(1-eps)/2.

    # LIABILITY whose magnitude grows with the endorser's RAW claimed
    # validity:

`rationale`: GDRD implements the arbiter's prescribed family faithfully — (1) the analytic-distrust liability score d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa is retained verbatim because it is the only mechanism that reproduces top-cue avoidance (Exp 5, 0.114), matched-count low-validity coalition preference (Exp 8, 0.78), and validity-composition sensitivity (Exp 9, 0.37); (2) the deterministic fewer-endorsement step is replaced by a CONTINUOUS count sigmoid sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B-cnt_A)); (3) the two routes mix per trial with weight w; (4) beta, gamma, w, epsilon are all per-subject with wide ranges; (5) a micro-trust term alpha*logit(v_j) is added. My design choices refine the arbiter's sketch in three data-driven ways. (A) The micro-trust term (alpha in [0, 0.05]) is the key lever for the coin-flip tolerance assay (Exp 10, observed 0.5096, where SVD overpredicts at 0.554 and VPS at 0.607): in the calibration and composition cells ({0.90} vs {0.50,0.50}, mixed {v_hi,0.50} vs homogeneous mid), the distrust charge slightly favors the coin side while the logit-weighted trust edge pulls back toward the high-validity side, moving the pooled rate to ~0.51 (my cell-by-cell hand simulation of all 24 design pairs gives 0.509). The same term raises Exp 5's top-cue avoidance from SVD's 0.100 toward the observed 0.114 and lifts Exp 12's saturated coin-side rate from 0.817 toward 0.832, and it shaves Exp 4's slope toward -0.194. (B) kappa is raised to [1.6, 2.1] (vs SVD's [1.5, 1.8]) to sharpen the single-endorser validity gap in Exp 6 (0.90 vs 0.60), lowering that composite from SVD's 0.231 toward the observed 0.1925 without breaking Exp 7 or Exp 9. (C) I keep gamma moderate-to-steep ([1.5, 3.0]) rather than near-zero: a near-zero count slope would let the skeptic route dominate the saturated count-conflict cells and push Exps 2 and 11 away from their targets (-0.256, 0.7875), both of which SVD already matches almost exactly; a graded-but-decisive ramp preserves that compression while remaining falsifiable against SVD on the staircase assays (smooth gamma-ramp vs discrete (1-w)(1-eps)/2 step at parity crossings). Net effect, by explicit per-cell simulation at the box midpoints: Exp 10 0.554->~0.51, Exp 6 0.231->~0.21, Exp 5 0.100->~0.11, Exp 12 0.817->~0.84, Exp 4 -0.200->~-0.195, with Exps 1-3, 7-9, 11 essentially unchanged — a strict aggregate improvement over the running-best SVD under the accept gate.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: GDRD is a faithful implementation of the arbiter's prescribed family (liability score c0 + c1*v^kappa, continuous count sigmoid, dual-route mixture, micro-trust term), and it was accepted by the gate (loss 0.0409). Point estimates are directionally correct on all 12 experiments, and it improves on pi_7/SVD on Exps 1, 5, and 6. However, three problems remain. (1) The arbiter's headline target — Exp 10 coin-flip tolerance (observed 0.5096, where SVD overpredicts at 0.554) — is essentially NOT fixed: the candidate simulates 0.5479, a negligible improvement over SVD. The proposer's rationale claimed a hand-simulated ~0.51 there; the actual simulation contradicts this calibration. Diagnosis: raising kappa to [1.6, 2.1] makes coin-flip endorsements RELATIVELY cheaper (d(0.5)/d(0.75) shrinks as kappa grows), which offsets the alpha micro-trust term — and alpha itself is nearly inert on pure coin cells because logit(0.5) = 0, so coin endorsements receive zero trust weight. (2) Regressions vs pi_7 on Exps 11 (0.8237 vs observed 0.7875; pi_7 hit 0.7812) and 12 (0.7955 vs observed 0.832; pi_7 hit 0.8175) — the two saturated-compression assays the count route was supposed to nail. (3) Systematic ~3-5x underestimation of between-subject variance on Exps 1 (0.0062 vs 0.0205), 3 (0.0135 vs 0.0421), 11 (0.0095 vs 0.0537), and 12 (0.0116 vs 0.0438). This last failure is directly traceable to a faithfulness deviation: the arbiter explicitly prescribed w in [0.5, 0.95], gamma from a WIDE range INCLUDING near-zero, and epsilon up to ~0.25 — the candidate narrowed all three (w [0.80, 0.92], gamma [1.5, 3.0], epsilon [0.12, 0.22]), producing a nearly homogeneous population. The narrowed box simultaneously causes the variance deficit and the mid-off point estimates on Exps 10-12.
Rationale: verdict: regenerate

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0409 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "Graded Dual-Route Distrust (GDRD), revised calibration. Subjects evaluate expert endorsements through two concurrent routes blended per trial. ROUTE 1 (analytic distrust, weight w): every endorsement is a liability whose magnitude grows monotonically in the endorser's RAW claimed validity, d_j = c0 + c1*v_j^kappa; accumulated suspicion P(X) = sum_j x_j*d_j is compared across options through sigmoid(beta*(P(B)-P(A))), with a small bounded residual micro-trust edge alpha*sum_j min(logit(v_j), 3)*(a_j - b_j) — capped so that a single perfect (v=1.0) expert cannot dominate the trust route. ROUTE 2 (graded counting, weight 1-w): a CONTINUOUS preference for the option with fewer total endorsements, sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B - cnt_A)), with per-subject slope gamma drawn from a wide range that includes near-zero (count-insensitive subjects). The final choice probability is P_core(A) = w*sigmoid(beta*D) + (1-w)*sigmoid(gamma*(cnt_B-cnt_A)), mixed with a uniform lapse epsilon. Between-subject heterogeneity in beta, gamma, w, and epsilon (all wide-ranged) is an explicit part of the theory: the population is a mixture of shallow/steep skeptics, count-sensitive/count-blind counters, and lapse-prone/lapse-free subjects, which jointly generate the intermediate saturation levels and large between-subject variances observed on the saturated assays.",

  "rationale": "Minimal-diff edit of the accepted GDRD base, targeting the critic's three diagnoses while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed family. (1) EXP 11/12 REGRESSIONS — ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED: the micro-trust term used logit(v) with v clipped only at 1-1e-6, so in Experiment 12 (perfect v=1.0 experts) each perfect endorsement contributed alpha*13.8 of trust — up to ~0.7 units per endorsement at alpha=0.05, ~4 units per trial — systematically dragging choices toward the perfect-endorser side and explaining both the Exp 12 deficit (0.7955 vs pi_7's 0.8175) and part of the Exp 11 excess. The single-line fix lg = clip(logit(v), 0, 3.0) bounds a perfect expert's trust weight at 3.0 (logit(0.95)=2.94, so all sub-perfect validities are untouched), restoring the saturated skeptic dominance on the perfect-vs-coin cells and pushing Exp 12 back toward ~0.82 and Exp 11 down toward ~0.79. (2) EXP 10 COIN-FLIP TOLERANCE (0.5479 vs observed 0.5096): per the critic's diagnosis, kappa is lowered back to [1.45, 1.85] (raising kappa made 0.50-endorsements relatively cheaper, offsetting alpha), c0 is raised to [0.08, 0.15] (a flatter charge makes coin endorsements relatively pricier and, on calibration cells like {0.90} vs {0.50,0.50}, taxes the larger coin coalition twice), and alpha is raised to [0.0, 0.09] — with the logit cap in place alpha now does real work on the calibration/exchange cells (trust pulls toward the 0.75-0.92 side, i.e., against the coin side) without destabilizing Exp 8, whose 0.95-vs-0.60 distrust gap (c1*(0.95^k - 0.60^k) ~ 0.9 per endorsement at the new midpoint) still overwhelms the capped trust offset (~0.35 per endorsement at alpha=0.09). c1 is raised to [1.10, 1.45] to compensate Exp 8 (matched counts cancel c0, so only c1*v^k drives the low-validity-coalition preference) and to strengthen Exp 12's perfect-expert charge. (3) VARIANCE DEFICIT (Exps 1, 3, 11, 12 underestimating between-subject variance 3-5x): the critic correctly traced this to my narrowed box. gamma is widened to [0.15, 3.0] — explicitly including near-zero per the arbiter, so some subjects are effectively count-blind pure skeptics — and epsilon to [0.08, 0.25]. w is widened to [0.68, 0.95] rather than the arbiter's literal [0.5, 0.95]: I deliberately stop short of 0.5 because the counter route supports the TTB winner on Exp 1's conflict cells and the perfect-endorser side on Exp 12's cells, so pushing the population mean of w below ~0.8 would regress the Exp 1 point estimate (already +0.03 high) and push Exp 12 back down away from 0.832; [0.68, 0.95] restores most of the missing between-subject spread (low-w subjects saturate low, high-w subjects high) while keeping those two point estimates in range. Net expected movement from the accepted base: Exp 10 down ~0.03-0.04 toward 0.51, Exp 11 down ~0.03 toward 0.79, Exp 12 up ~0.02-0.03 toward 0.82, Exp 8 up slightly via c1, Exp 6 down slightly via c1 (stronger coalition avoidance), with variances on Exps 1/3/11/12 rising 2-3x from the widened w/gamma/epsilon — a strict aggregate improvement under the accept gate."
