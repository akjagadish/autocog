# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Keep pi_4's deterministic inverse-valence, all-cue weighted tally plus validity-ordered tie-break logic, but regenerate its parameter ranges. Specifically: (1) lower validity_weight from about 2.0 to a subject-level distribution centered near 1.2, e.g. Normal(1.2, 0.25) truncated to roughly [0.7, 1.8]; this preserves some validity weighting, as required by Experiment 8, while allowing low-validity majority effects in Experiment 2. (2) Set beta_tally subject-level with a lognormal median near 0.40 and range about [0.20, 0.80] to balance the strong tally effect in Experiment 6 against the softer Experiment 2 gradient. (3) Keep beta_tiebreak near a lognormal median of 1.0, range roughly [0.5, 1.6], preserving the approximately 0.70/0.30 tie-break choice seen in Experiment 1. (4) Keep epsilon around 0.10 with a logit-normal subject-level distribution, range about [0.03, 0.20]. (5) Do not introduce cue-inclusion probabilities; retain deterministic inclusion and the existing tie-break rule. These changes should keep Experiment 1 flat, move Experiment 2 from about -0.13 to roughly 0.85-0.95, improve Experiments 6 and 8, and increase the currently underestimated between-subject variance toward the observed values.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People invert the valence of binary expert ratings: a 1 is treated as a costly defect and a 0 as a clean, favorable signal. Across all features they compute an inverse-tally advantage for A, weakly weighting the inverse cues by the experts' stated validities. When the raw inverse tally is nonzero, choice is a noisy softmax over the two weakly validity-weighted inverse tallies. When the raw inverse tally is exactly tied, people do not guess uniformly; instead they break the tie lexicographically by consulting features in descending validity order and choosing the option that has a clean 0 on the first discriminating feature. Response noise is captured by a softmax plus an independent uniform lapse. This differs from Take The Best because it aggregates all cues rather than stopping at the first discriminator, and from plain inverse tallying because ties are resolved by validity-ordered clean-cue use instead of guessing.

- epsilon: [0.02, 0.30]
- validity_weight: [0.50, 2.30]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
This is a minimal recalibration of the accepted candidate's subject-level parameter distributions, leaving the deterministic inverse-valence, all-cue validity-weighted tally and validity-ordered clean-cue tie-break unchanged. Validity_weight is shifted upward to a truncated normal centered at 1.50 with support [0.50, 2.30], so a subset of subjects use validity strongly enough to produce the validity-driven reversals needed in Experiments 6 and 8, while the lower tail preserves low-validity majority effects in Experiment 2. Beta_tally is moved to a truncated lognormal with median 0.55 and support [0.25, 1.10], steepening inverse-tally gradients in Experiments 2 and 5. Beta_tiebreak keeps its median near 1.0 but receives a wider lognormal spread to add heterogeneity without moving the Experiment 1 and 3 central tendencies far. Epsilon is logit-normal centered near 0.10 with sigma 0.70 over [0.02, 0.30], increasing lapse-related between-subject variance. These distribution-only edits target the prior candidate's main failure: systematic underdispersion and insufficiently strong validity-weighted reversals.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0685 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0649 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0649.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully preserves the prescribed inverse-valence, all-cue validity-weighted tally with validity-ordered tie-break, and it matches the central tendencies well on Experiments 1, 3, and 4. It also improves Experiment 2 relative to pi_4. However, it is systematically underdispersed relative to real subjects: Experiment 5 var=0.0105 vs observed 0.1584, Experiment 6 var=0.0260 vs observed 0.4244, and Experiment 8 var=0.2983 vs observed 2.8518. Point estimates also fall short in Experiment 5 (0.1721 vs 0.2658), Experiment 6 (0.0175 vs 0.0867), and Experiment 8 (0.7525 vs 1.0100), and Experiment 2 is not negative enough (-0.5681 vs -0.6438). Experiment 7 is near zero (-0.0100) versus a small positive observed value (0.0725), though its variance matches well. The likely cause is that the validity_weight distribution centered near 1.2 and the beta_tally median near 0.40 are too weak and too homogeneous to generate the validity-driven reversals and steep inverse-tally gradients seen in the data.
Rationale: Keep the same mechanism family, but recalibrate the subject-level parameter distributions. (a) Widen and shift validity_weight upward for a subset of subjects, e.g., a truncated normal centered around 1.4-1.6 with an upper tail near 2.0, or a two-component mixture, so that Experiments 6 and 8 show stronger validity-driven reversals while the lower tail still allows low-validity majority effects in Experiment 2. (b) Raise the beta_tally median to roughly 0.55-0.65 and widen its range to about [0.25, 1.10] to steepen the inverse-tally gradient in Experiments 2 and 5 and to increase between-subject variance. (c) Keep beta_tiebreak near a median of 1.0 but increase its spread (e.g., lognormal sigma around 0.5) to add heterogeneity without moving the Experiment 1 and 3 point estimates much. (d) Widen epsilon, e.g., logit-normal sigma around 0.7 over [0.02, 0.30], to increase lapse-related between-subject variance. These are parameter-distribution adjustments only; the deterministic inverse-valence tally and validity-ordered tie-break should remain intact.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0685 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0649 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate keeps the prescribed inverse-valence, all-cue validity-weighted tally with validity-ordered clean-cue tie-break, and its aggregate loss improved from 0.0685 to 0.0649. The recalibration helped some experiments: Experiment 2 is now very close (-0.6269 vs -0.6438), Experiment 6 improved to 0.0633 vs 0.0867, and Experiment 5 improved to 0.1929 vs 0.2658. However, the fit is still not strong enough overall. The most consistent failure is severe underdispersion: Experiment 5 candidate var=0.0179 vs real var=0.1584; Experiment 6 candidate var=0.0586 vs real var=0.4244; Experiment 8 candidate var=0.7142 vs real var=2.8518. Experiments 1, 2, and 4 are also underdispersed relative to real subjects. In addition, Experiment 8 moved in the wrong direction despite the stronger validity weighting: candidate value fell from 0.7525 at iteration 1 to 0.5050 at iteration 2, while the real value is 1.0100. Experiment 7 remains too flat at 0.0150 vs a real value of 0.0725. The likely cause is that a single unimodal validity_weight and beta_tally distribution cannot simultaneously produce enough near-deteministic validity-sensitive subjects for Experiment 8, enough noisy low-gradient subjects for the inverse-tally majority effects in Experiment 2, and enough between-subject heterogeneity across all experiments.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the same mechanism family and do another in-family recalibration, this time with more strongly heterogeneous subject-level distributions. First, replace the single truncated-normal validity_weight with a two-component mixture: a low component centered around 0.8-1.0 with support roughly [0.3, 1.2] to preserve low-validity majority effects in Experiment 2, and a high component centered around 2.8-3.2 with support roughly [2.0, 4.0] so that a meaningful subset of subjects produces strong validity-driven reversals in Experiments 6 and 8. Second, similarly mixture beta_tally: keep a majority component with median near 0.35 supporting the soft inverse-tally gradient in Experiment 2, and add a high component with median near 1.3-1.6 and support up to about 2.0 to generate larger between-subject variance and steeper choices in Experiments 5, 6, and 8. Third, widen epsilon further, ideally with a small high-lapse component reaching 0.40-0.50, while keeping most subjects near 0.05-0.15 so the central tendencies are not flattened. Fourth, leave beta_tiebreak near its current [0.45, 1.90] range because Experiments 1 and 3 are already reasonably matched. The deterministic inverse-valence tally and validity-ordered tie-break rule should remain unchanged. These are parameter-distribution adjustments only, designed to fix the remaining underdispersion and the Experiment 8 shortfall without switching mechanism family."
