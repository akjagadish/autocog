# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Propose a validity-weighted inverse-clean-count theory without an orientation mixture, without a top-cue bonus, and with exchangeable tied cues. All subjects treat an expert rating of 0 as clean/favorable and 1 as a defect, preserving the Experiment 1 result of zero positively valenced subjects. Every discriminating cue contributes continuous weighted evidence rather than entering an all-or-none tally: option A gains w_j when feature j has A=0/B=1 and loses w_j when A=1/B=0. Subject-specific weights are monotone, heavy-tailed transforms of communicated validity, e.g., w_j = exp(a_i * logit(v_j) + b_i), so high-validity cues dominate when validity gaps are clear but low-validity cues can still matter enough to produce large individual differences on difficult designs like Experiment 10. Choice is a softmax over net evidence with subject-specific gain and lapse/epsilon noise. When net evidence is near zero or no cue discriminates, subjects inspect high-validity experts in order; if several experts share the highest validity, the order is randomly permuted per trial/subject or their weight is split equally, avoiding the stable-sorting artifact that inflates top-cue effects in Experiment 2. This new theory should keep pi_5's successful universal inverse-valence and variance behavior while replacing inclusion gating and the deterministic tie-break with continuous weighting and tied-cue exchangeability.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Human subjects uniformly treat a binary expert rating of 1 as a defect and 0 as a clean/favorable signal. Every discriminating expert cue contributes continuous weighted evidence rather than entering an all-or-none tally: option A gains subjective weight w_j when feature j has A=0/B=1 and loses w_j when A=1/B=0. The weights are subject-specific monotone transforms of communicated validity, w_j = exp(a_i * (logit(v_j) - mean(logit(v)))), normalized to average one, so high-validity experts dominate clear validity gaps while low-validity majorities still move choice. Choice is a numerically stable softmax over net inverse-clean evidence with a subject-specific gain and an independent lapse. When net evidence falls below a subject-specific inconclusiveness threshold, people inspect changed experts in descending validity order, but any tied top-validity experts are randomly ordered per trial so tied cues are exchangeable. The model contains no valence-orientation mixture and no separate top-cue bonus.

- validities: validities

`rationale`:
This theory keeps the successful universal inverse-valence behavior of pi_5 while removing all-or-none inclusion gating, the valence-orientation mixture, and the deterministic stable-sort tie-break. The continuous exponential validity weights ensure every discriminating cue contributes, so low-validity majorities can still influence difficult designs such as Experiment 10, while clear validity gaps let high-validity experts dominate. Heavy-tailed subject-level slope, gain, and lapse distributions preserve realistic between-subject variance. The near-zero evidence fallback uses a validity-ordered scan only after continuous evidence is inconclusive, and randomly permutes tied top-validity cues across trials, preventing the stable-sorting artifact that inflated top-cue effects in Experiment 2 and Experiment 12. The absence of positively valenced orientation subjects directly reproduces the Experiment 11 result of zero positive subjects and strengthens inverse-choice effects in Experiment 1.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2897 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2897.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family: universal inverse valence (0=clean, 1=defect), continuous validity-weighted evidence instead of inclusion gating, no orientation mixture, no top-cue bonus, softmax plus subject-level lapse, and an exchangeable random tie-break among tied top-validity cues in the inconclusiveness fallback. It reproduces part of pi_5's successes: Experiment 11 is exact (0.0000 vs 0.0000, var 0.0068), Experiment 3 is essentially on target (-0.4242 vs -0.4300), Experiment 7 is the best-fitting theory we have (0.0863 vs 0.0725), and Experiments 9 and 12 are within tolerance (0.4604 vs 0.3050; 1.5455 vs 1.2973). However, the candidate badly misses the bulk of the empirical patterns. Experiment 6 is off by +0.79 (0.8733 vs real 0.0867): the candidate follows validity-weighted evidence on the metric's conflict cells, while humans are near chance there. Experiment 8 is wrong-signed (-1.8138 vs +1.0100), the single biggest failure. Experiment 4 collapses to near chance (0.0394 vs 0.4925): humans track the \u00b12 inverse tally strongly, but the candidate's steep weights let high-validity cue alignments cancel the majority direction. Experiments 1 and 2 are far too weak (-0.1133 vs -0.5117; -0.1831 vs -0.6438): the single top cue outvotes the five-cue lower coalition, whereas humans let the lower coalition dominate. Experiments 5 and 10 show over-extreme validity-following (0.6833 vs 0.2658; -0.0390 vs -0.1667, i.e. q\u22480.04 vs q\u22480.21). The unifying diagnosis is that the subject-specific slope, drawn from a lognormal with median 1.8 (range 0.30-5.00), makes w_j = exp(a\u00b7(logit(v_j) \u2212 mean logit v)) far too steep: with the 6-7 cue validity arrays the top cue receives roughly 20-25\u00d7 the weight of the bottom cue. Humans' behavior across Experiments 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 is consistent with near-equal (tally-like) weights plus only modest validity sensitivity, not with such a steep validity ordering.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Stay inside the prescribed family but flatten the validity-to-weight mapping, since the current log-linear slope distribution is the main miscalibration. Concretely: (1) replace the exponent with a much gentler monotone transform, e.g. w_j = exp(a\u00b7(logit(v_j) \u2212 mean logit v)) with a drawn from a tightened distribution (median \u2248 0.3-0.5, hard cap \u2248 1.0-1.2 instead of the current lognormal(1.8, 0.65) capped at 5.0), or use a near-linear transform like w_j = 1 + c\u00b7(v_j \u2212 mean v) with small subject-level c, keeping the mean normalization. Predicted effects of this single knob: Experiments 1 and 2 recover strong inverse-valence effects because the five-cue lower coalition (\u22485\u00b7w\u0304) now overrides the single top cue exactly as humans do; Experiment 4 regains s=\u00b12 tally sensitivity (net \u2248 \u00b12w\u0304 gives p_A \u2248 0.75/0.25 before lapse, matching the observed \u22480.49 majority effect); Experiment 6's validity/tally conflict cells move to near-chance, matching the observed 0.0867; Experiment 5 drops toward the observed 0.2658; Experiment 10 moderates to q\u22480.2; and the Experiment 8 sign flips positive, where pi_5's tally-like behavior also sits (+1.3512 vs real +1.0100). (2) Preserve everything that currently works: keep the universal inverse valence (Experiment 11 exact), keep the softmax gain and lapse mechanics but verify they can still separate s=\u22122/0/+2 tallies at the clicker level, and keep the randomized tied-cue fallback that made Experiments 3 and 7 land well. Do not reintroduce orientation mixtures, inclusion gating, top-cue bonuses, or deterministic stable-sort tie-breaks. This is a within-family parameter/transform tuning, not a mechanism redesign."
