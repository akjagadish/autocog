# generation_iter_03_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Replace pi_3 with a validity-pruned inverse-tally theory. Keep the inverse valence assumption that a 0 rating is clean/favorable and a 1 is a defect. Instead of using all cues equally, as pi_3 does, each cue j probabilistically enters an inverse clean-cue tally with inclusion probability p_include_j = logistic(alpha * validity_j + gamma). The included-cue tally then drives a softmax choice. If the included tally is exactly zero, resolve the tie by consulting the highest-validity discriminating cue and choosing the option with the clean 0 there; only guess if no included cue discriminates. Add hierarchical subject-level parameters for alpha, gamma, beta_tally, beta_tiebreak, and epsilon with wide ranges or lognormal priors, so the pooled mean stays pi_4-like while the between-subject variance rises toward the large observed values in Exp1 and Exp2. This differs from pi_3 by introducing validity sensitivity and a proper tie-break, and differs from pi_4 by using stochastic validity gating with zero-weight excluded cues rather than fixed linear weighting of all cues, which predicts a weaker Exp2 validity effect than pi_4's 0.2158 while preserving correct signs across all experiments.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.994)

**Description**
People invert the valence of binary expert ratings: a 1 is treated as a costly defect and a 0 as a clean, favorable signal. Across all features they compute an inverse-tally advantage for A, weakly weighting the inverse cues by the experts' stated validities. When the raw inverse tally is nonzero, choice is a noisy softmax over the two weakly validity-weighted inverse tallies. When the raw inverse tally is exactly tied, people do not guess uniformly; instead they break the tie lexicographically by consulting features in descending validity order and choosing the option that has a clean 0 on the first discriminating feature. Response noise is captured by a softmax plus an independent uniform lapse. This differs from Take The Best because it aggregates all cues rather than stopping at the first discriminator, and from plain inverse tallying because ties are resolved by validity-ordered clean-cue use instead of guessing.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.487)

**Description**
People invert the meaning of binary expert ratings: a rating of 1 is treated as a defect or costly negative signal, and a rating of 0 is treated as a clean or favorable signal. Across all features, they tally how often each option is defect-free relative to the other option, and choose the option with the larger defect-free tally. Ties lead to guessing. Choice probability is a noisy softmax over the two defect tallies with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse process that produces uniform guessing with probability epsilon. The heuristic uses all features equally, ignores validities and past trials, and differs from Take The Best by aggregating rather than stopping at the first discriminating cue, and from standard Tallying by reversing the valence of the binary ratings.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.002)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0894 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0793 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0259 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0259 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
People invert the valence of binary expert ratings: a 1 is treated as a defect and a 0 as a clean, favorable signal. Each feature j probabilistically enters an inverse clean-cue tally with inclusion probability p_include_j = logistic(alpha * validity_j + gamma); excluded cues receive exactly zero weight. The included clean-cue tally drives a noisy softmax choice, and exact zero tallies are resolved by consulting the highest-validity included discriminating cue and choosing the option with the clean 0 there. If no included cue discriminates, people guess. Subject-level alpha, gamma, beta_tally, beta_tiebreak, and epsilon create individual differences, with heavy-tailed/logit-transformed subject-level distributions so that some subjects are nearly deterministic while others remain noisy, preserving the pooled inverse-valence pattern and realistically large between-subject variance.

`parameters`:
- alpha: [5.0, 9.0]
- gamma_logit: [-2.50, 2.50]
- beta_tally_log: [-0.30, 0.50]
- beta_tiebreak_log: [0.40, 1.10]
- epsilon_logit: [-3.00, -0.40]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: This is a minimal parameter-prior edit on top of the accepted validity-pruned inverse-tally architecture. The architecture is unchanged, but the direct uniform subject-level parameters are replaced by heavy-tailed transformed draws: log-uniform for beta_tally and beta_tiebreak, a symmetric logit-centered transform for gamma within the requested [-4.5, -2.5] band, and a logit transform for epsilon. The effective beta_tally range is now about 0.74-1.65 and beta_tiebreak about 1.49-3.00, making small inverse tallies and clean-zero tie-breaks more decisive, which repairs the under-powered Exp2, Exp3, and Exp4 scores. Tightening gamma to [-4.5, -2.5] with an edge-concentrated shape restores a small positive Exp6 validity-gradient effect instead of the previous overcorrection to zero, while alpha [5,9] removes the very high-alpha tail that flattened validity sensitivity. The interval transforms also raise targeted between-subject variance, especially in Exp5/Exp6, without the uniform widening that previously inflated Exp1-Exp3 variance.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate correctly reproduces the qualitative pattern across all six experiments — inverse-valence sensitivity in Exp1/2/4, anti-TTB consistency in Exp3, the positive Exp5 pair-sign score, and a small positive Exp6 validity-weighting effect — so the prescribed mechanism family (stochastic validity gating of an inverse clean-cue tally plus clean-0 tie-break) is working. Exp1 is essentially perfect (-0.5075 vs -0.5117) and Exp5 is close (0.3071 vs 0.2658). However, the magnitudes are off in four experiments, and the between-subject variances systematically fall short of the observed values, which the arbiter explicitly asked to raise. Specifically: Exp2 is under-sensitive (-0.4406 vs -0.6438, worse than both pi_3 and pi_4); Exp4 is roughly half the observed effect (0.2494 vs 0.4925); Exp3 is too weak an anti-TTB score (-0.3137 vs -0.4300); Exp6 over-uses validity weighting (0.1850 vs 0.0867, close to pi_4's 0.2158). Variances are too low nearly everywhere: Exp1 0.010 vs 0.016, Exp2 0.025 vs 0.043, Exp4 0.029 vs 0.066, Exp5 0.012 vs 0.158, Exp6 0.026 vs 0.424. Mechanistic diagnosis: the steep inclusion logistic (alpha 8-11, gamma -5.6..-4.8) makes high-validity cues near-certainly included and low-validity cues frequently excluded. This (i) stochastically dilutes small tallies, blunting the Exp2 pos/neg contrast and especially the s=±2 rows of Exp4, while (ii) making the Exp6 stimuli behave like near-fixed weighting on high-validity cues, overshooting the small observed positive validity effect. The narrow subject-level parameter spans also leave the hierarchical variance far below the observed subject heterogeneity, and the tie-break gain plus 5-15% epsilon noise keep Exp3 anti-TTB too weak relative to the real -0.4300.
Rationale: Keep the prescribed mechanism (stochastic 0/1 validity gating driving an inverse clean-cue tally, clean-0 highest-validity tie-break) but retune its parameters. First, dramatically widen the subject-level ranges, as the arbiter originally requested (e.g., alpha 2-12, gamma -7..-0.5, beta_tally 0.2-1.5, beta_tiebreak 0.4-2.5, epsilon 0.02-0.4, possibly lognormal for beta_tiebreak/beta_tally) so pooled means stay correct while between-subject variance rises toward the large Exp1/2/5/6 values. Second, raise the average inclusion rate (shift gamma less negative) and moderate alpha to flatten the validity gradient: this repairs the diluted s=±2 tallies in Exp4 and the weak Exp2 pos/neg gap, while pulling the Exp6 validity effect down from 0.185 toward the observed 0.087. Third, raise the mean of beta_tally and beta_tiebreak (and/or shift epsilon's range downward) so the softmax and tie-break are more decisive, strengthening Exp2, Exp3, and Exp4 without changing any sign. These are in-family amplitude/range adjustments; no change to the gating-plus-inverse-tally-plus-tie-break architecture is needed.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0894 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0793 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The prescribed mechanism family is working qualitatively: all six metrics still carry the correct sign, which is a major advantage over pi_1, pi_2, and pi_3 on several experiments. The current candidate also improves the aggregate loss from 0.0894 to 0.0793, mainly by repairing Exp4 from 0.2494 to 0.3538, modestly deepening Exp2 from -0.4406 to -0.4925, and pulling Exp6 from a too-large 0.1850 down to 0.0058. The architecture of stochastic validity gating feeding an inverse clean-cue tally plus a clean-zero tie-break is therefore not in question. However, the quantitative calibration remains unsatisfactory in several places. Exp2 is still too shallow at -0.4925 versus the observed -0.6438. Exp3 anti-TTB responding is too weak at -0.3063 versus -0.4300. Exp4 is still too shallow at 0.3538 versus 0.4925. Exp6 now overcorrects to essentially no validity weighting at 0.0058 versus 0.0867. Exp5 has the right positive direction but is low in both mean, 0.1971 versus 0.2658, and especially between-subject variance, 0.0249 versus 0.1584. Exp6 variance is likewise far too small, 0.0994 versus 0.4244. At the same time, the broadened uniform parameter ranges now overshoot variance in Exp1 through Exp3, which suggests the heterogeneity structure needs more targeted control rather than further global widening.
Rationale: Keep the accepted stochastic-gating plus inverse-tally plus clean-zero tie-break architecture and perform another parameter-level tune. First, make the core choice more decisive by raising beta_tally and beta_tiebreak, for example beta_tally near 0.7 to 1.6 and beta_tiebreak near 1.5 to 3.0, while keeping epsilon moderate. The current beta ranges still leave Exp2, Exp3, and Exp4 under-powered, especially when zero tallies or small tallies arise from stochastic gating. Second, correct the Exp6 overcorrection by moving gamma to an intermediate band, roughly -4.5 to -2.5, with alpha near 5 to 9. The previous advice to increase average inclusion was accepted and helped Exp2 and Exp4, but the current -5.0 to -1.5 range went too far and nearly erased the validity gradient in Exp6. An intermediate gamma band should restore the small positive Exp6 effect near 0.087 without returning to the too-strong iter-1 value of 0.185. Third, do not simply widen every uniform parameter range again, because that has already inflated Exp1 through Exp3 variance above the observed levels. Instead, use lognormal or heavy-tailed subject-level priors concentrated on beta_tiebreak, beta_tally, gamma, and epsilon so that some subjects make near-deterministic choices and others remain noisy. This is the in-family change most likely to raise the very large observed between-subject variances in Exp5 and Exp6 while keeping the pooled signs and means stable in the other experiments.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0793 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0259 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The pooled point estimates are now close to the real data across all six experiments. All signs are correct, and the largest point-estimate gap is about 0.07 on Exp5, with Exp2 and Exp6 nearly exact and Exp1, Exp3, and Exp4 within about 0.05. This is a substantial improvement and supports the prescribed stochastic validity-gated inverse-tally mechanism. The failure is in between-subject variance, especially where the arbiter and the candidate's own rationale claimed improvement. Exp5 variance is 0.0130 versus the observed 0.1584, roughly twelve times too small. Exp6 variance is 0.0941 versus 0.4244, more than four times too small. Exp1, Exp2, and Exp4 variances are also modestly low, while Exp3 variance is slightly high. Mechanistically, the subject-level transforms still keep nearly all simulated subjects in the same decisive, validity-monotonic mode: alpha is positive for everyone, gamma is negative for everyone, and the beta and epsilon ranges leave most choices fairly confident. This produces nearly uniform Exp5 pair-sign scores and consistently positive Exp6 validity-gradient scores, whereas the real subjects show a wide mixture including near-zero and possibly reversed validity sensitivity.
Rationale: Keep the accepted stochastic-gating plus inverse clean-cue tally plus clean-zero tie-break architecture, since the pooled means are now good. Revise only the heterogeneity layer. First, give alpha/gamma a heavy-tailed or two-component subject-level prior so a minority of subjects are validity-insensitive or weakly reversed in inclusion; this is needed to generate zero or negative Exp6 per-subject validity-gradient scores and approach the observed var of 0.4244. Second, add an upper tail to epsilon_logit so a subset of subjects is near chance, which should raise the overly tight Exp5 variance from 0.0130 toward 0.1584 without necessarily moving the pooled mean much. Third, preserve the current central beta_tally, beta_tiebreak, and gamma values that repaired Exp2, Exp3, Exp4, and Exp6 point estimates. Do not uniformly widen all parameter ranges again, because that previously overcalibrated Exp1 through Exp3 variance; instead concentrate the added heterogeneity on parameters that specifically drive the Exp5 and Exp6 metrics.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0259 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "People invert the valence of binary expert ratings: a 1 is treated as a defect and a 0 as a clean, favorable signal. Each feature j probabilistically enters an inverse clean-cue tally with inclusion probability p_include_j = logistic(alpha * validity_j + gamma); excluded cues receive exactly zero weight. Most subjects use validity-sensitive inclusion, but a minority of subjects enter a validity-insensitive gating mode with elevated lapse, so they occasionally treat cues nearly equally or fall back toward chance. The included clean-cue tally drives a noisy softmax choice, and exact zero tallies are resolved by consulting the highest-validity included discriminating cue and choosing the option with the clean 0 there. If no included cue discriminates, people guess. Subject-level alpha, gamma, beta_tally, beta_tiebreak, and epsilon create individual differences, with a two-component gating mixture producing large between-subject variance while preserving the pooled inverse-valence pattern.",
