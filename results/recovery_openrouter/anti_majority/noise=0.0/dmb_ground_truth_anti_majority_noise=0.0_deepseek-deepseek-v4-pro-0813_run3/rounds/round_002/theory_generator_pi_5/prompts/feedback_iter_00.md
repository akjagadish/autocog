# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Replace pi_3 with a validity-pruned inverse-tally theory. Keep the inverse valence assumption that a 0 rating is clean/favorable and a 1 is a defect. Instead of using all cues equally, as pi_3 does, each cue j probabilistically enters an inverse clean-cue tally with inclusion probability p_include_j = logistic(alpha * validity_j + gamma). The included-cue tally then drives a softmax choice. If the included tally is exactly zero, resolve the tie by consulting the highest-validity discriminating cue and choosing the option with the clean 0 there; only guess if no included cue discriminates. Add hierarchical subject-level parameters for alpha, gamma, beta_tally, beta_tiebreak, and epsilon with wide ranges or lognormal priors, so the pooled mean stays pi_4-like while the between-subject variance rises toward the large observed values in Exp1 and Exp2. This differs from pi_3 by introducing validity sensitivity and a proper tie-break, and differs from pi_4 by using stochastic validity gating with zero-weight excluded cues rather than fixed linear weighting of all cues, which predicts a weaker Exp2 validity effect than pi_4's 0.2158 while preserving correct signs across all experiments.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People invert the valence of binary expert ratings: a 1 is treated as a defect and a 0 as a clean, favorable signal. Instead of using all cues equally, each feature j is probabilistically gated into an inverse clean-cue tally with inclusion probability p_include_j = logistic(alpha * validity_j + gamma); excluded cues receive exactly zero weight. The included clean-cue tally drives a noisy softmax choice, and exact zero tallies are resolved by consulting the highest-validity included discriminating cue and choosing the option with the clean 0 there. If no included cue discriminates, people guess. Subject-level alpha, gamma, beta_tally, beta_tiebreak, and epsilon create individual differences while preserving the pooled inverse-valence pattern.

    probs = probs / total
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))

`parameters`:
- alpha: [8.0, 11.0]
- gamma: [-5.6, -4.8]
- beta_tally: [0.35, 0.55]
- beta_tiebreak: [0.85, 1.35]
- epsilon: [0.05, 0.15]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
This replaces pi_3's validity-blind equal tallying with validity-pruned inverse tallying, so high-validity features are more likely to participate and low-validity features are sometimes excluded entirely. Unlike pi_4's fixed continuous validity weighting, validity sensitivity enters through sparse all-or-none inclusion, which weakens the Experiment 6 validity effect toward the observed small positive value while still preserving the inverse-valence signs in Experiments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The zero-tally tie-break uses the highest-validity included discriminating cue and favors the clean 0, producing the negative TTB-consistency score in Experiment 3 and the correct asymmetries in Experiment 5. Moderately wide subject-level parameter ranges raise between-subject variance toward the large observed values in Experiments 1 and 2 without sacrificing the pooled mean pattern.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0894 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0894.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate correctly reproduces the qualitative pattern across all six experiments \u2014 inverse-valence sensitivity in Exp1/2/4, anti-TTB consistency in Exp3, the positive Exp5 pair-sign score, and a small positive Exp6 validity-weighting effect \u2014 so the prescribed mechanism family (stochastic validity gating of an inverse clean-cue tally plus clean-0 tie-break) is working. Exp1 is essentially perfect (-0.5075 vs -0.5117) and Exp5 is close (0.3071 vs 0.2658). However, the magnitudes are off in four experiments, and the between-subject variances systematically fall short of the observed values, which the arbiter explicitly asked to raise. Specifically: Exp2 is under-sensitive (-0.4406 vs -0.6438, worse than both pi_3 and pi_4); Exp4 is roughly half the observed effect (0.2494 vs 0.4925); Exp3 is too weak an anti-TTB score (-0.3137 vs -0.4300); Exp6 over-uses validity weighting (0.1850 vs 0.0867, close to pi_4's 0.2158). Variances are too low nearly everywhere: Exp1 0.010 vs 0.016, Exp2 0.025 vs 0.043, Exp4 0.029 vs 0.066, Exp5 0.012 vs 0.158, Exp6 0.026 vs 0.424. Mechanistic diagnosis: the steep inclusion logistic (alpha 8-11, gamma -5.6..-4.8) makes high-validity cues near-certainly included and low-validity cues frequently excluded. This (i) stochastically dilutes small tallies, blunting the Exp2 pos/neg contrast and especially the s=\u00b12 rows of Exp4, while (ii) making the Exp6 stimuli behave like near-fixed weighting on high-validity cues, overshooting the small observed positive validity effect. The narrow subject-level parameter spans also leave the hierarchical variance far below the observed subject heterogeneity, and the tie-break gain plus 5-15% epsilon noise keep Exp3 anti-TTB too weak relative to the real -0.4300.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the prescribed mechanism (stochastic 0/1 validity gating driving an inverse clean-cue tally, clean-0 highest-validity tie-break) but retune its parameters. First, dramatically widen the subject-level ranges, as the arbiter originally requested (e.g., alpha 2-12, gamma -7..-0.5, beta_tally 0.2-1.5, beta_tiebreak 0.4-2.5, epsilon 0.02-0.4, possibly lognormal for beta_tiebreak/beta_tally) so pooled means stay correct while between-subject variance rises toward the large Exp1/2/5/6 values. Second, raise the average inclusion rate (shift gamma less negative) and moderate alpha to flatten the validity gradient: this repairs the diluted s=\u00b12 tallies in Exp4 and the weak Exp2 pos/neg gap, while pulling the Exp6 validity effect down from 0.185 toward the observed 0.087. Third, raise the mean of beta_tally and beta_tiebreak (and/or shift epsilon's range downward) so the softmax and tie-break are more decisive, strengthening Exp2, Exp3, and Exp4 without changing any sign. These are in-family amplitude/range adjustments; no change to the gating-plus-inverse-tally-plus-tie-break architecture is needed."
