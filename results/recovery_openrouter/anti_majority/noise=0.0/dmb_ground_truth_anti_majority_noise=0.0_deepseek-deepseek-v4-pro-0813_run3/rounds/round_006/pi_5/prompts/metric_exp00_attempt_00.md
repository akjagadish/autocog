# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=11):** [0.95, 0.95, 0.95, 0.95, 0.95, 0.85, 0.85, 0.85, 0.85, 0.85, 0.85]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** This design uses 11 features: five high-validity experts at 0.95 and six low-validity experts at 0.85. Every unique pair uses all 11 features as discriminating cues, so the six pairs form a 2-direction by 3-coalition-size factorial. In the critical majority-size cell the raw inverse-clean tally is +1 (six low-validity A-clean cues versus five high-validity B-clean cues). The advocated probabilistic-inclusion tally predicts a clear A advantage because the low cues are included with high probability and outnumber the five high cues. The competing continuous-weight theory, however, uses saturating logit-tanh validity weights that give the five 0.95 cues only about 1.10 weight and the six 0.85 cues about 0.91 weight, so 6*0.91 - 5*1.10 is approximately -0.06 at the median saturation. That near-zero weighted evidence sends the competing model into its inconclusive-evidence fallback, where the five tied top-validity cues all favor B, producing p(A) around 0.40. The advocated model stays above 0.60 for A. The mirror pair reverses this, giving p(A) around 0.60 for the competing model and below 0.40 for the advocated model. The two adjacent coalition-size pairs move the competing weighted evidence upward to about +0.33 and +0.71 for the positive-raw-tally direction, so the competing model's p(A) crosses from below 0.5 to about 0.53 and 0.57 while the advocated model remains roughly flat near 0.62. This yields a quantitative crossover interaction, not just a main effect. The six unique pairs are repeated K = 16 times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People invert the valence of binary expert ratings: a 1 is treated as a defect and a 0 as a clean, favorable signal. Each feature j probabilistically enters an inverse clean-cue tally with inclusion probability p_include_j = logistic(alpha * validity_j + gamma); excluded cues receive exactly zero weight. The included clean-cue tally drives a noisy softmax choice, and exact zero tallies are resolved by consulting the highest-validity included discriminating cue and choosing the option with the clean 0 there. If no included cue discriminates, people guess. Subject-level alpha, gamma, beta_tally, beta_tiebreak, and epsilon create individual differences, with heavy-tailed/logit-transformed subject-level distributions so that some subjects are nearly deterministic while others remain noisy, preserving the pooled inverse-valence pattern and realistically large between-subject variance.

**Parameters:**
- alpha: [5.0, 9.0]
- gamma_logit: [-2.50, 2.50]
- beta_tally_log: [-0.30, 0.50]
- beta_tiebreak_log: [0.40, 1.10]
- epsilon_logit: [-3.00, -0.40]
- validities: validities

```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** All subjects treat a binary expert rating of 0 as clean/favorable and 1 as a defect. On each trial every discriminating expert contributes continuous inverse-valence evidence weighted by a saturating, near-tally-like transform of communicated validity: w_j = 1 + m * tanh(2 * [logit(v_j) - mean(logit(v))] / half_range), with the weight vector normalized to mean one. The subject-level saturation m is small and capped, so high-validity experts are attended more but cannot generate extreme top-to-bottom weight ratios: a three-cue high-validity coalition can win small conflicts yet is overridden by a five-cue low-validity majority. When the weighted evidence is inconclusive, or when the raw inverse-clean tally is exactly balanced, subjects fall back to inspecting changed experts in descending validity order with tied highest-validity experts randomly permuted per trial; the precision of that fallback grows with the validity gap separating the best expert from the next-best expert. Choice is a softmax over net evidence with subject-specific gain and lapse. There is no valence-orientation mixture and no separate top-cue attention bonus.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

The continuous weighted-evidence theory predicts near-zero weighted evidence, triggering its lexical fallback to the highest-validity clean cue, which favors B, so it predicts a lower probability of choosing A. The second trial type is the exact mirror, so the two theories reverse their probabilities in opposite ways. The metric is Pr(choose A in trial type 1) minus Pr(choose A in trial type 2). The advocated model predicts a positive value, while the competing model predicts a negative value.
