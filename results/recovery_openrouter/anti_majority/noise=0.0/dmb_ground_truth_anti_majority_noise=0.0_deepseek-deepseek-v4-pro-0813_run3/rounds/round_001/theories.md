# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python

    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current
    # trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B. Cue cascade: features are consulted in order
    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    if val.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )
    # Descending validity; argsort is stable so validity ties break
    # toward the earlier feature index.
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break

    if winner is None:
        # No discriminating cue — pure guess.
        return np.ones(2) / 2.0

    scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. For the
    # binary TTB score this collapses to sigmoid(beta) for the winner,
    # giving a direct mapping from beta onto the paper's flip-noise
    # levels (beta=0 ↔ 50/50; beta ≫ 1 ↔ deterministic).
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People invert the meaning of binary expert ratings: a rating of 1 is treated as a defect or costly negative signal, and a rating of 0 is treated as a clean or favorable signal. Across all features, they tally how often each option is defect-free relative to the other option, and choose the option with the larger defect-free tally. Ties lead to guessing. Choice probability is a noisy softmax over the two defect tallies with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse process that produces uniform guessing with probability epsilon. The heuristic uses all features equally, ignores validities and past trials, and differs from Take The Best by aggregating rather than stopping at the first discriminating cue, and from standard Tallying by reversing the valence of the binary ratings.

**Rationale:** Standard positive Tallying predicted positive metric values because it chooses the option favored by more 1-valued cues, whereas the human data show negative sensitivity to that cue direction. Reversing cue polarity makes the model treat 1s as defects and 0s as favorable evidence, flipping the predicted metric sign to match the observed negative values. Using all features avoids the flat near-zero metric produced by Take The Best in these experiments, because lower-cue disagreement can still influence choice. The noise parameters are deliberately non-deterministic: the arbiter noted that deterministic defect-counting would produce roughly -0.83 and -1.00 on Experiments 1 and 2, while the observed values are -0.51 and -0.64. The beta range of 1 to 5 and epsilon range of 0.30 to 0.40 add sufficient softmax uncertainty and lapse guessing to bring the model close to those observed values while preserving the inverse-tallying mechanism.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[1.0, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.30, 0.40]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
import numpy as np

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f'Inverse-tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.')

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]

    # Defect-free wins: A has a 0 where B has a 1.
    a_wins_defects = float(np.sum(b > a))
    # Defect-free wins: B has a 0 where A has a 1.
    b_wins_defects = float(np.sum(a > b))

    scores = np.array([a_wins_defects, b_wins_defects])

    beta = float(parameters['beta'])
    epsilon = float(parameters['epsilon'])

    # Numerically stable softmax over inverse-cue tallies.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
import numpy as np

def policy(probs):
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs = probs / probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** People invert the valence of binary expert ratings: a 1 is treated as a costly defect and a 0 as a clean, favorable signal. Across all features they compute an inverse-tally advantage for A, weakly weighting the inverse cues by the experts' stated validities. When the raw inverse tally is nonzero, choice is a noisy softmax over the two weakly validity-weighted inverse tallies. When the raw inverse tally is exactly tied, people do not guess uniformly; instead they break the tie lexicographically by consulting features in descending validity order and choosing the option that has a clean 0 on the first discriminating feature. Response noise is captured by a softmax plus an independent uniform lapse. This differs from Take The Best because it aggregates all cues rather than stopping at the first discriminator, and from plain inverse tallying because ties are resolved by validity-ordered clean-cue use instead of guessing.

**Rationale:** The proposed theory keeps the strong inverse-tally effect that drives the negative top-cue dependence in Experiment 1 and the inverse-tally contrasts in Experiments 2 and 4, while fixing two mechanistic failures of the earlier theories. Take The Best fails because it stops at the first discriminating cue and therefore cannot produce the observed inverse, all-cue aggregation effects. Plain inverse tallying fails in Experiment 3 because those single-discriminator trials have an exactly tied inverse tally, causing uniform guessing; here the validity-ordered clean-cue tie-break systematically chooses the option with a 0 on the first discriminating feature, which reproduces the observed negative TTB-agreement score. Adding weak validity weighting to the otherwise equal-weight inverse tally allows the magnitude of the inverse-tally effect to differ between Experiments 2 and 4 as observed, because a raw inverse-tally advantage of +/-2 is composed of different cue locations with different validity weights in the two designs. Narrow parameter ranges around the selected softmax temperatures, lapse rate, and weak validity-weighting strength keep the pooled predictions near the observed metric values while retaining a psychologically plausible amount of response noise.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta_tally`: `[0.43, 0.47]`
  - `beta_tiebreak`: `[1.00, 1.08]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.09, 0.11]`
