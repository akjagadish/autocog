# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace TTB (pi_1) with a 'Red-Flag Integration with Trait Polarity' (RFI) theory, designed as a sharp competitor to SPI (pi_4). Core claims: (1) Each binary expert rating of 1 is read as a 'red flag' — evidence AGAINST the carrying option — by a majority of subjects; a minority reads polarity conventionally (endorsement = evidence for). Crucially, polarity is a stable PER-SUBJECT trait, not a per-trial mixture: subject i has sign s_i ∈ {+1, -1} with P(s_i = -1) = π at the population level, π ∈ [0.6, 0.95]. (2) All cues are integrated additively: evidence for A over B is E_i = s_i · Σ_j w_j (a_j - b_j), with w_j ∝ v_j^γ, γ ∈ [0, 1] (near-flat weighting; validity plays at most a mild role — this preserves SPI's successful all-cue integration). (3) Choice is a softmax over [E_i, -E_i] with per-subject inverse temperature beta ∈ [1, 20] (allowing the high sensitivity the observed extreme values demand) plus an independent lapse epsilon ∈ [0, 0.15] to uniform; identical vectors yield exactly 50%. Implementation: same predict/policy skeleton as SPI but with rho replaced by a per-subject fixed sign (drawn once per subject from Bernoulli(1-π) for conventional), no within-subject probability mixing. How it differs from both incumbents: vs TTB, it uses all cues with graded evidence (so it is not pinned at 0 on the slope/density/invariance metrics where TTB is structurally stuck and where the data show 0.52–0.72 magnitudes); vs SPI, it replaces per-trial polarity mixing with trait polarity, so pooled predictions reach the observed extremes (Exp 2's -0.68, Exp 5's -0.72) without fine-tuning, and it makes a falsifiable subject-level prediction SPI cannot make: subject-level diagnostic metrics should be BIMODAL (consistently anti-endorsement subjects near the extreme, a small consistently-conventional cluster near the mirror extreme) rather than clustered at an attenuated middle as SPI's rho mixing implies — directly testable against the reported between-subject variances. If future experiments show subjects flip polarity within session, RFI is falsified in SPI's favor; if subjects are trait-consistent and extreme, RFI supersedes SPI. Either way the arbitration program retains two viable, task-invariant theories instead of one viable theory plus a structurally dead one.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Red-Flag Integration with Trait Polarity (RFI), recalibrated population. When choosing between two products described by binary expert ratings, most subjects read a rating of 1 as a 'red flag' — evidence AGAINST the option carrying it — so the sparser option is perceived as higher quality; a small minority reads polarity conventionally. Polarity is a stable PER-SUBJECT trait: each subject has a fixed sign s_i ∈ {+1, -1} drawn once at the population level with P(s_i = -1) = π, where π sits at the TOP of its range (0.92–0.95), i.e. the population is nearly homogeneous in the anti-endorsement reading. Within a subject, all cues are integrated additively with near-flat validity weighting: evidence for A over B is E = s_i · Σ_j w_j (a_j − b_j), w_j ∝ v_j^γ, γ ∈ [0, 1]. Choice is a softmax over [E, −E] with per-subject inverse temperature β ∈ [6, 20] (excluding the near-chance low-β regime entirely) plus a small independent lapse ε ∈ [0, 0.05] to uniform; identical rating vectors yield exactly 50%. The recalibration keeps the trait-polarity architecture, the additive all-cue evidence rule, and the softmax/lapse skeleton exactly as prescribed, but makes the simulated population nearly homogeneous: the conventional mirror cluster shrinks to ~5–8%, no subject is near chance, and noise is small. This simultaneously (a) strengthens the pooled anti-endorsement signal toward the observed extremes (Exp 3 ≈ -0.72, Exp 5 ≈ 0.59, Exp 6 ≈ -0.68), (b) pulls Exp 2's tally-conflict rate down from 0.25 toward 0.18, and (c) collapses the between-subject variances from the 5–14x inflation the heterogeneous box produced toward the tight real values — because a nearly-pure, consistently-sensitive population varies far less than a 78/22 polarity mixture spanning β ∈ [1, 20].

`rationale`:
This is the minimal-diff edit the critic prescribed: the trait-polarity architecture, additive all-cue evidence rule, and softmax/lapse skeleton are kept verbatim; ONLY the population-level parameter ranges change. The critic's diagnosis was that iter 1's point estimates were uniformly attenuated (Exp 2: 0.248 vs real 0.181; Exps 3/5/6 undershooting the anti-endorsement extremes) while between-subject variances were 5–14x the real values, and that both failures trace to the SAME source: excess population heterogeneity — the ~22% conventional mirror cluster (E[pi]≈0.78), the near-chance low-beta tail (beta as low as 1), and lapses up to 0.15. The three range changes fix exactly those three culprits: (1) pi narrowed to [0.92, 0.95], so the conventional mirror cluster shrinks to ~5–8% — enough to keep the falsifiable bimodality signature alive (a small consistently-conventional cluster remains) but small enough that pooled variances approach the tight real values (the 78/22 split alone accounted for roughly the entire Exp 2 variance inflation of 0.140); (2) beta raised to [6, 20], excluding the near-chance regime that both diluted pooled extremes and dominated variance; (3) epsilon shrunk to [0, 0.05]. Expected effects, per experiment: Exp 1 stays near 0.15–0.18 (real 0.158) because inverted subjects side with the sparser option which coincides with the TTB option on most dissociation trials there; Exp 2 drops from 0.248 toward ~0.15 (real 0.181) as consistently sensitive anti-endorsement subjects choose against the denser tally winner; Exps 3/5/6 magnitudes rise from -0.51/0.43/-0.53 toward the real -0.72/0.59/-0.68 as within-subject dilution disappears and only the small conventional minority attenuates the pooled signal; Exp 4's negative margin slope deepens from -0.45 toward -0.52. All six between-subject variances should fall several-fold, from 5–14x the real values toward within ~2–3x. I deliberately chose beta's lower bound at 6 (the critic's less aggressive option) rather than 8, because on the extreme-evidence experiments (3 and 6) very high sensitivity pushes per-subject metrics toward the structural extreme (-1), and the moderate end of [6, 20] keeps the pooled value from overshooting the observed -0.72/-0.68 while still eliminating the near-chance subjects. If the residual variance still overshoots after this recalibration (most likely on Exp 2, where a 6% mirror cluster alone contributes ~0.03 against a real 0.012), the critic's prescribed in-family fallback — narrowing beta further around a moderate-high value to attenuate individuals toward the pooled value — remains available without touching the trait-sign mechanism.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0935 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1134 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0935.

    Three structurally identified trial classes (validity order is fixed:
    [0.90, 0.89, 0.88, 0.87, 0.70, 0.60]):

    HIGH  - the top cue (0.90) discriminates and every other discriminating
            cue agrees with it (design trials 1, 2, 9, 10; 24 obs/subject).
            PWEI evidence margin |D| is maximal (~1 or w_top).
    DEPTH5- cues 1-4 all tie; only the 0.70-validity cue discriminates
            (design trials 11, 12; 12 obs/subject). PWEI's weight for
            0.70^gamma is ~1e-5 of total, so PWEI predicts ~50% choices.
    REV   - the top cue discriminates one way, the three sub-top cues
            (0.89, 0.88, 0.87) discriminate the other way, tail cues tie
            (design trials 3, 4; 12 obs/subject). In PWEI's steep-gamma
            regime the sub-top block outweighs the top cue, so PWEI
            chooses AGAINST the TTB winner.

    For each class compute p = P(choose the TTB winner). TTB's structural
    invariant is a single constant confidence p* on every discriminating
    trial, so 2*p_HIGH - p_DEPTH5 - p_REV = 0 exactly, at ANY (beta, eps).
    PWEI predicts p_HIGH ~ 0.9, p_DEPTH5 ~ 0.5, p_REV ~ 0.1-0.37, giving a
    value ~0.9-1.2 across its entire parameter box.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the arbiter-prescribed RFI family (per-subject trait sign, additive near-flat weighting, softmax + lapse), and it was accepted by the gate — its point estimates are uniformly at least as good as SPI's (pi_4) and better on Exps 3/4/6 (e.g., Exp 3: -0.512 vs SPI's -0.505 against real -0.717; Exp 6: -0.525 vs -0.501 against real -0.676). But two systematic problems remain. (1) POINT ESTIMATES: the candidate still undershoots the anti-endorsement extremes on Exps 3, 5, 6 (-0.51 vs -0.72; 0.43 vs 0.59; -0.53 vs -0.68) and overshoots toward 0.5 on Exp 2 (0.248 vs real 0.181). Both errors point to the same mechanism: too much attenuation in the population — the ~22% conventional minority (E[pi]≈0.78), the low-beta tail (beta as low as 1 gives near-chance subjects), and the lapse up to 0.15 all dilute the pooled signal. (2) BETWEEN-SUBJECT VARIANCE: this is the decisive failure. The candidate's variances are 5x-14x the real values on every experiment (Exp 1: 0.059 vs 0.012; Exp 2: 0.140 vs 0.012; Exp 3: 0.638 vs 0.094; Exp 4: 0.323 vs 0.054; Exp 5: 0.468 vs 0.038; Exp 6: 0.553 vs 0.039). The arbiter explicitly framed RFI's bimodality signature as 'directly testable against the reported between-subject variances' — and the test comes back largely negative: real subjects are far more homogeneous than a 78/22 trait mixture with beta in [1,20] produces. The mirror-cluster minority and the near-chance low-beta subjects are the variance culprits. The good news is that both fixes are in-family parameter recalibrations, not structural changes: the trait-polarity mechanism itself can survive if the population is nearly homogeneous (pi at the top of the allowed range, beta tight and high, epsilon small), which simultaneously strengthens the pooled signal toward the observed extremes and collapses the variance.
Rationale: Keep the RFI trait-polarity family exactly as prescribed, but recalibrate the population distribution — the current parameter box produces a heterogeneous population (large conventional minority + near-chance low-beta subjects) that the real data contradict on both fronts. Concretely: (1) Push pi to the top of the prescribed range, e.g., sample pi in [0.92, 0.95] rather than [0.6, 0.95] (E[pi]≈0.78 now means ~22% conventional subjects; a mirror cluster that large alone forces between-subject variance far above the real 0.012-0.05 values, and it drags pooled point estimates toward 0 on Exps 3/5/6 while pushing Exp 2 up toward 0.25). (2) Tighten and raise beta: exclude the near-chance regime, e.g., beta in [6, 20] or [8, 20]. beta≈1-3 subjects behave randomly, which both attenuates the pooled extremes and is a major source of the 5-14x variance inflation (Exp 2: sim var 0.140 vs real 0.012). (3) Shrink the lapse range to epsilon in [0, 0.05]; a 0.15 lapse adds noise the tight real variances cannot accommodate. (4) Keep gamma in [0, 1] as is — the near-flat weighting is working (all-cue integration matches the data's graded structure). The target signature after recalibration: Exp 2 point down from 0.248 toward 0.18; Exps 3/5/6 magnitudes up toward -0.72 / 0.59 / -0.68; and all six between-subject variances down to within ~2x of the real values. If, after pushing pi to 0.95 and tightening beta, the variance still overshoots (especially Exp 2's 0.012), that is evidence the remaining heterogeneity must come from moderate per-subject sensitivity rather than polarity mixtures — address it within the family by narrowing beta further around a moderate-high value (attenuating individual subjects toward the pooled value) rather than by reintroducing per-trial mixing. Do not alter the trait-sign architecture, the additive evidence rule, or the softmax/lapse skeleton — those are faithful to the arbiter's prescription and are producing the correct qualitative pattern; only the population-level calibration is off.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0935 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1134 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

  "interpretation": "The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed RFI family (trait sign drawn once per subject, additive near-flat weighting, softmax + lapse) \u2014 no drift out of family. But the gate REJECTED it (loss 0.1134 vs running-best 0.0935), and the per-experiment numbers show why: my iteration-1 advice to homogenize the population was applied too aggressively, and the recalibration OVERSHOT. Point estimates: Exp 1 jumped from 0.124 to 0.306 (real 0.158, now off by +0.148 \u2014 the single worst error in the loop); Exp 3 went from -0.512 to -0.877 (real -0.717); Exp 4 from -0.448 to -0.673 (real -0.523); Exp 6 from -0.525 to -0.867 (real -0.676); Exp 5 from 0.435 to 0.659 (real 0.594); and Exp 2 crossed the target from above (0.248 \u2192 0.121 vs real 0.181). The pattern is unambiguous: with pi \u2248 0.935 and beta \u2208 [6, 20], nearly every simulated subject is a strongly-sensitive anti-endorsement responder, so pooled metrics saturate past the observed magnitudes on four of six experiments. The variance half of my advice DID work \u2014 every between-subject variance fell several-fold (Exp 1: 0.059 \u2192 0.010, now matching the real 0.012; Exp 3: 0.638 \u2192 0.252; Exp 4: 0.323 \u2192 0.191) \u2014 but Exps 2 (0.084 vs 0.012), 5 (0.320 vs 0.038) and 6 (0.214 vs 0.039) remain 5\u20138x too high. That residual inflation is now attributable to the remaining beta spread [6, 20]: high-beta subjects pin their per-subject metrics at structural extremes (\u00b11), while moderate-beta subjects sit partway in, producing a wide between-subject spread even in a nearly pure polarity population. The diagnosis is therefore calibration, not architecture: iter 1 was too heterogeneous (attenuated points, huge variance), iter 2 is too homogeneous and too sensitive (saturated points, residual variance from beta spread). The correct setting lies between the two flanking iterations.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "My iteration-1 push ('homogenize: pi to 0.92\u20130.95, beta to 6\u201320, epsilon to 0.05') was rejected by the gate \u2014 the direction was right on variance but the step size was too large, so I am explicitly recommending an INTERMEDIATE recalibration, not a further push in the same direction and not a reversion to iter 1. Keep the RFI trait-polarity architecture, additive evidence rule, and softmax/lapse skeleton verbatim; change only population ranges, splitting the difference between the two flanking iterations: (1) pi \u2208 [0.85, 0.92] (E[pi] \u2248 0.885, i.e. a ~11% conventional minority \u2014 halfway between iter 1's ~22% and iter 2's ~6%). This should pull Exp 1 back from 0.306 toward ~0.15\u20130.20, Exp 2 from 0.121 back up toward ~0.18, and shave the anti-endorsement overshoots on Exps 3/4/6 by the needed 0.10\u20130.19. (2) beta \u2208 [3, 10] with the mass of the range moderate \u2014 this is the key dual-purpose knob: moderate beta attenuates per-subject choice probabilities away from the structural extremes, which simultaneously (a) pulls the pooled point estimates back from saturation (-0.877 \u2192 ~-0.70 on Exp 3, -0.867 \u2192 ~-0.70 on Exp 6, -0.673 \u2192 ~-0.55 on Exp 4) and (b) collapses the residual between-subject variance on Exps 2/5/6, because subjects no longer split between 'pinned at \u00b11' (beta \u2248 20) and 'partway' (beta \u2248 6) \u2014 they cluster tightly around the pooled value. If a single tight band is preferred, beta \u2208 [4, 8] is the safest guess. (3) epsilon \u2208 [0, 0.08] \u2014 slightly wider than iter 2's [0, 0.05] to add a little pooled attenuation without reintroducing near-chance subjects. (4) Leave gamma \u2208 [0, 1] untouched; the near-flat all-cue weighting is producing the correct graded structure on every slope metric and is not implicated in any current error. Do NOT reintroduce per-trial polarity mixing, do not widen pi back toward [0.6, 0.95], and do not lower beta below ~3 (that resurrects the near-chance regime that caused iter 1's variance blowup). The target signature: Exp 1 \u2248 0.15\u20130.20, Exp 2 \u2248 0.18, Exp 3 \u2248 -0.70, Exp 4 \u2248 -0.55, Exp 5 \u2248 0.58, Exp 6 \u2248 -0.70, with all six between-subject variances within ~2x of the real values. If this intermediate calibration still leaves Exps 2/5/6 variance high while points fit, the next in-family step is narrowing beta further around a single moderate value (e.g., [4, 6]) \u2014 not touching the trait-sign mechanism."
