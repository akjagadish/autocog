## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended decision-making theories make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every theory agrees, and prefer pairs that maximally dissociate the candidate theories. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Sparse-Option Preference / Polarity-Inverted Evidence Integration (SPI). When choosing between two options described by binary expert ratings, a substantial share of subjects systematically mis-map cue polarity: an endorsement (rating = 1) is treated as evidence AGAINST an option, so the option with FEWER 1s (the sparser option) is perceived as higher quality — consistent with a 'fewer red flags' reading of the display or a rarity-implies-quality inference. Subjects integrate ALL cues additively with near-uniform weights: the evidence for option A over B is E = sum_j w_j * (b_j - a_j), where w_j = v_j^gamma with gamma small (validity plays at most a mild role). Choice is a softmax over [E, -E] with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse epsilon to uniform. A per-subject polarity-mixing weight rho captures heterogeneity: with probability 1-rho the subject responds according to the inverted (sparse-preferring) polarity, with probability rho according to the conventional polarity. This mixture attenuates the extreme pure-sparse predictions toward the moderately negative values observed. The theory is sharply distinguished from both incumbents: unlike Take-The-Best it uses all cues and inverts the evidence sign (so it is not pinned at ~0 on the depth/conflict-invariance and margin-slope metrics where TTB is structurally stuck), and unlike power-weighted integration it places humans at the FLAT end of the weighting ladder with inverted polarity, producing the negative signatures that steep-gamma PWEI cannot generate at any parameter setting.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] The design exploits two orthogonal dissociations between Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying. (1) SIGN dissociation with graded tally margins: On conflict trials, the top-validity cue favors one option while the majority of cues favors the other. Critically, TTB's predicted choice probability is a constant sigmoid(beta) on every such trial (it only ever uses the single top discriminating cue), whereas Tallying's confidence scales with the tally margin: sigmoid(beta) for 2-vs-1, sigmoid(2*beta) for 3-vs-1, sigmoid(3*beta) for 4-vs-1. So TTB predicts FLAT confidence across trials 1/3/5/13 (margins 3, 1, 2, 1 respectively) while Tallying predicts systematically increasing confidence in the majority option — a quantitative, trial-level signature that model recovery cannot confuse. Mirrored versions (trials 2/4/6/14) control for side bias. (2) TALLY-TIE dissociation: Trials 7/8 have a 2-2 tally with one tied cue, so Tallying must guess (exactly 50%) while TTB is confident (sigmoid(beta)) because the top cue discriminates. Agreement/control trials (9-12, 15-16) anchor both models and check that subjects are not simply counting or simply using cue 1. Validities are spread (0.95 down to 0.55) so the validity ordering is unambiguous and communicated up front; the second and third cues are placed far enough below the top cue that TTB's cascade is well defined, and low-validity cues (0.65, 0.60, 0.55) are close together so Tallying treats them as a coherent majority block. With 16 unique pairs and K=6 repetitions (96 trials), each dissociating cell gets enough repetitions for reliable per-cell choice proportions. Predicted pattern: if TTB is correct, choice proportions on trials 1, 3, 5, 13 should be statistically indistinguishable from each other (all ~sigmoid(beta) favoring the top-cue option) and well above 50% on trials 7/8; if Tallying is correct, choices on conflict trials should track the tally margin (increasingly favoring the majority option from trial 3 -> 5 -> 1) and trials 7/8 should sit at exactly 50%.

[1] This design dissociates Tallying from Take-The-Best (TTB) with a 3x3 factorial grid plus controls, using 8 cues with strictly descending, well-separated validities (.95 down to .60) so TTB's cascade order is unambiguous. GRID: In the 9 core cells (G1-G9), the first cue that discriminates is cue d in {1, 3, 5} (cues above d are tied), and that cue always favors B, so TTB always picks B with p = sigmoid(beta) -- a completely FLAT prediction across the entire grid, independent of both the tally and the discriminating cue's validity. Orthogonally, the total tally margin M in {+2, 0, -2} (from A's perspective) is varied by arranging the cues below d. Tallying predicts p(B) = sigmoid(-M*beta): at M = -2 both theories pick B but with different confidence (Tallying sigmoid(2*beta) vs TTB sigmoid(beta) -- an agreement-direction CONFIDENCE dissociation); at M = 0 Tallying must guess at exactly 50% while TTB is confident at sigmoid(beta); at M = +2 the theories conflict in direction (Tallying strongly favors A at sigmoid(2*beta), TTB favors B at sigmoid(beta)). Thus the signature is a 2D response surface: TTB predicts a flat plane (no effect of margin, no effect of cue depth), Tallying predicts a monotone gradient in margin only, crossing exactly 50% at M = 0. The depth dimension additionally tests whether confidence depends on the discriminating cue's validity (.95 vs .85 vs .75) -- both theories predict no effect, which rules out validity-weighted alternatives and verifies TTB's order-based (not magnitude-based) cascade; if choices track cue validity both target theories fail. Mirrored versions (swapping A and B) control for side bias and must be analyzed by 'cue-winner side' rather than option label. EXTREME CONFLICT (T2/T2m): cue 1 alone favors one option against all 7 other cues -- TTB stays at sigmoid(beta) while Tallying is near-certain (sigmoid(6*beta)), the largest possible confidence gap. ANCHORS: T1/T1m (all cues agree) check that subjects follow the evidence at all; T3/T4 (identical vectors) verify that both models' 50% guessing prediction holds and catch key-bias artifacts. 24 unique pairs x K = 4 repetitions = 96 trials exactly, giving 8 observations per grid cell (4 per unmirrored cell + 4 mirrored) for stable per-cell choice proportions. Predicted outcomes: if Tallying is correct, p(cue-winner) declines monotonically with margin (high at M=-2, exactly 50% at M=0, low at M=+2) with no effect of depth; if TTB is correct, p(cue-winner) is statistically indistinguishable across all 18 grid trials and both extreme-conflict trials, at a common sigmoid(beta) < 1.

[2] This design targets the specific operating regime PWEI claims for humans (gamma in [35,50], i.e., a steep but finite power transform) and opposes it to TTB's two structural invariants: (i) constant confidence sigmoid(beta) on EVERY trial where any cue discriminates, regardless of which cue, its validity, or what lower cues say, and (ii) 50% only when all cues tie. The validity ladder is deliberately TIGHT at the top (0.90, 0.89, 0.88, 0.87) with a long tail (0.70, 0.60). At any gamma in [35,50], the three sub-top cues' combined power-weight EXCEEDS the top cue's weight (e.g., at gamma=40: 0.89^40+0.88^40+0.87^40 = 0.0193 > 0.90^40 = 0.0148), so PWEI must REVERSE against the top cue on the flagship 1-vs-3 trials (T2/T2m), predicting p(top-cue option) between 0.25 (gamma=35) and 0.45 (gamma=50) — never above 0.5 — while TTB predicts the top-cue option at its full constant confidence p*. This direction conflict is sign-robust across PWEI's entire parameter box. Second, trials T2, T3, T4, T5 all have cue 1 (0.90) as the first discriminating cue favoring the same option, but with graded weighted evidence D (gamma=40: -0.13, -0.02, +0.16, +0.43). TTB predicts a FLAT p* across all four; PWEI predicts a monotone psychometric sweep from ~0.31 to ~0.88 — a ~0.6-wide confidence gradient on trials TTB treats as identical. Third, depth invariance: on T6/T6m cues 1-4 tie and cue 5 (validity only 0.70) decides; TTB predicts the SAME constant p* as on cue-1 trials, while PWEI's weight for 0.70^gamma is ~1e-5 of the total, forcing ~50% choices. T8/T9 probe depth 2: TTB stays at p*, PWEI is at ~50% (T8, near-canceling block) or 0.82 (T9). T1/T1m anchor both models near ceiling; T10 (identical vectors) verifies both models' 50% guessing prediction and catches key bias. Mirrored versions of every dissociating trial control side bias; analysis should pool by cue-winner. With 16 unique pairs and K=6 (96 trials exactly), each cell yields 12 observations per subject (6 + 6 mirrored). Predicted outcomes: if TTB is correct, choice proportions favoring the first-discriminating-cue winner are statistically indistinguishable across ALL of T1-T9 and their mirrors (one common p*), including the 1-vs-3 reversal trials and the 0.70-validity depth trials, with T10 at 50%; if PWEI is correct, confidence tracks the weighted evidence margin D: below 50% for the top cue on T2, near 50% on T3/T6/T8, and graded from ~0.7 to ~0.9 on T4/T5/T9 — a pattern TTB's two-level step function cannot produce, and conversely a flat p* pattern that PWEI's steep-gamma regime cannot produce because the tight ladder forces it to vote against the top cue.

[3] This design attacks TTB's central structural invariant — a SINGLE constant choice probability p* = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2 on EVERY trial where any cue discriminates — using a validity architecture opposite to previously explored tight-top-ladder designs: one DOMINANT top cue (0.95, whose power-weight exceeds the entire rest of the ladder combined at every gamma in [35,50]: 0.95^40=0.1286 vs 0.0886 for cues 2-6) followed by a CONTESTED second tier (0.92 vs a 0.91/0.90/0.89/0.88 block whose combined power-weight exceeds cue 2's weight at every gamma in [35,50], e.g., at gamma=40: 0.0303 vs 0.0228). Consequence 1 (direction dissociation at depth 2): on L4-type trials cue 1 is tied, cue 2 (first discriminator) favors one option, and all four lower cues favor the other. TTB picks the cue-2 winner at p*; PWEI REVERSES, predicting p(cue-2 winner) between 0.33 (gamma=35) and 0.45 (gamma=50) — never above 0.5, sign-robust across PWEI's entire parameter box. Consequence 2 (graded confidence ladder): trials L0/L1/L2/L3/L4 hold cue 1 tied and cue 2 as first discriminator while the opposing block grows from 0 to 4 cues. PWEI predicts a monotone sweep of p(cue-2 winner) of roughly 0.73 / 0.59 / 0.48 / 0.42 / 0.37 (gamma=40, beta=8, eps=0.2), crossing 50% between L1 and L2 — a psychometric function of the weighted evidence margin D that TTB's two-level step function (p* or 50%) cannot produce at any (beta, eps). Consequence 3 (depth gradient on 'clean' trials): T1 (cue 1 decides, rest tied), L0 (cue 2 decides, rest tied), and U2 (cue 3 decides, rest tied) are identical to TTB — first discriminator, no other signal — so TTB predicts one common p*; PWEI predicts declining confidence 0.89 > 0.73 > 0.66 because the deciding cue's share of total weight shrinks with depth. Consequence 4 (agreement anchors): T3 (all cues agree, PWEI ~0.90) and T2 (cue 1 against all five others, PWEI 0.61-0.78, direction agreeing with TTB) show that even TTB's best single p* must simultaneously miss ~0.90 (T3), ~0.73 (L0), ~0.37 (L4) — no constant fits. Controls: C1/C2 (identical vectors) verify both models' 50% guessing and catch key bias; every dissociating trial has a mirrored twin (A/B swapped) to cancel side bias, with analysis pooled by cue-winner side. 24 unique pairs x K=4 = exactly 96 trials, giving 8 observations per cell per subject (4 + 4 mirrored). Decisive quantitative signatures: (i) Spearman correlation between cell choice proportion and PWEI's weighted margin D (strongly positive if PWEI true, ~0 if TTB true); (ii) L4 significantly below 50% for the first-discriminator winner; (iii) monotone L-ladder crossing 50%; (iv) T1 > L0 > U2 depth ordering. TTB predicts all discriminating cells statistically indistinguishable at one common p* and cannot approximate any of these patterns even with its full beta in [0.1,20], epsilon in [0,0.5] range, because its per-trial prediction is parameterized by a single constant independent of cue depth, cue validity, and lower-cue configuration.

[4] This design adversarially dissociates Take-The-Best (TTB) from Sparse-Option Preference / Polarity-Inverted Evidence Integration (SPI) by exploiting their two structural differences: (i) TTB uses ONLY the single highest-validity discriminating cue with conventional polarity (1 = good), producing one constant choice probability p* = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2 on EVERY trial where any cue discriminates; (ii) SPI integrates ALL cues with near-uniform weights and INVERTED polarity, preferring the option with FEWER 1s, producing a graded psychometric function of the weighted sparsity evidence E = sum_j w_j*(b_j - a_j). Validities are [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.70, 0.65, 0.60]: well-separated and descending so TTB's cascade order is unambiguous, yet close enough that SPI's sign of E is robust across its entire gamma in [0, 2] (verified at gamma = 0, 1, 2). DISSOCIATION 1 (direction, sign-robust across BOTH parameter boxes): Trial T6 presents unanimous evidence (A = all 1s, B = all 0s). TTB must pick the unanimously endorsed option with p >= 0.51 at ANY (beta in [0.1,20], eps in [0,0.5]) because sigmoid(beta) >= 0.5. SPI must pick the all-zeros option: E = -1, and even at its worst case (rho = 0.35, eps = 0.35, beta = 0.5) p(endorsed option) <= 0.476 < 0.5. The same sign-robust conflict holds on T0, T1, T7, T10, where the first-discriminating-cue winner carries more 1s (E = -w1, -w3, -w2, all < 0 for any gamma since the deciding cue always has the largest weight among consulted cues). DISSOCIATION 2 (quantitative sweep TTB cannot fit): Trials T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T4b, T5 hold cue 1 (0.95) as the first discriminating cue favoring the SAME option, while the lower-cue configuration sweeps SPI's inverted evidence monotonically: E(T0) = -(w1+w2+w3) in [-0.63, -0.50], E(T1) = -w1 in [-0.26, -0.17], E(T2) = -w1+w2 in [-0.05, 0], E(T3) = -w1+w2+w3 in [+0.11, +0.17], E(T4) in [+0.25, +0.32], E(T4b) in [+0.37, +0.49], E(T5) = 1-2*w1 in [+0.48, +0.67] — all sign-robust across gamma in [0,2]. TTB predicts ONE constant p* on every rung (cue 1 is always the sole basis); SPI predicts a monotone psychometric sweep crossing exactly 50% between T2 and T3 (e.g., at gamma=1, beta=6, eps=0.2, rho=0.1: approximately 0.20, 0.32, 0.48, 0.69, 0.80, 0.85, 0.88 for the cue-1 winner). No single constant can fit a ~0.7-wide sweep that straddles 50%, and conversely SPI cannot produce a flat confident p* because its output is strictly monotone in E. DISSOCIATION 3 (near-tie cell): on T2, SPI's evidence is in [-0.05, 0], forcing p ~ 50% (exactly 50% at gamma=0), while TTB is confident at p* > 0.51 — a confidence dissociation at exactly the point where SPI's evidence cancels. DISSOCIATION 4 (depth invariance): T7 (cue 3 decides) and T10 (cue 2 decides) are, to TTB, identical to T1 (same constant p*, only the discriminating cue's identity changes); SPI predicts slightly weaker anti-winner evidence (|E| = w2 or w3 < w1), a subtle ordering TTB forbids. CONTROLS: T9/T9b are identical-vector trials where both theories predict exactly 50% (key-bias check); every dissociating trial has a mirrored twin (A/B swapped) so side bias cancels, with analysis pooled by first-discriminating-cue winner. Decisive quantitative signatures: (a) p(unanimously endorsed option) < 0.5 on T6/T6m if SPI is true, > 0.5 if TTB is true — sign-robust over both full parameter boxes; (b) Spearman correlation between cell choice proportion and SPI's evidence E: strongly positive if SPI is true, ~0 if TTB is true; (c) monotone ladder T0 < T1 < T2 ~ 0.5 < T3 < T4 < T4b < T5 vs. TTB's flat equality of all ten discriminating cells; (d) T2 at ~50% while T1/T3 are confident. 24 unique pairs x K = 4 repetitions = exactly 96 trials, giving 8 observations per subject per pooled cell (4 unmirrored + 4 mirrored).

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — theories that depend on validity order re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) make many candidate theories indistinguishable, so spread them out.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended theories be dissociated; avoid trials where every theory agrees.

This architecture is chosen so that (a) TTB's cascade is unambiguous (cue 1, then cue 2, then the low block), and (b) SPI's near-uniform weighting (gamma in [0,2]) makes the low block act as a coherent 'counting block': at gamma=0 SPI's evidence is exactly the 1s-count difference (n_B - n_A)/8; even at gamma=2 the whole low block (sum weight 0.528) outweighs either top cue, so block-mass sign conclusions are robust across SPI's entire parameter box. TTB NEVER consults the low block whenever cue 1 or cue 2 discriminates \u2014 so the low block is invisible to TTB and decisive for SPI. The design sweeps the low-block mass from the TTB winner's side to the loser's side while holding the TTB decision constant, generating a wide monotone psychometric that TTB's single constant p* cannot fit at any (beta, epsilon).\n\nCORE DISSOCIATION 1 (TTB-flat vs SPI-sweep): Trials 1-6 (L1, L4, L5, L7, L8, L11) all have cue 1 (0.95) as the first and only-relevant discriminator favoring A, so TTB predicts ONE constant p(A) = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta)+eps/2 on all of them. SPI's evidence for A sweeps monotonically: E = -0.875/-0.77 (L1), -0.25/-0.35 (L4), -0.125/-0.24 (L5), 0/-0.04 (L7, exact cancellation at gamma=0), +0.125/+0.05 (L8), +0.625/+0.28 (L11) (values at gamma=0/gamma=2). At gamma=1, beta=6, eps=0.2, rho=0.1, SPI predicts p(TTB winner) of roughly 0.19, 0.27, 0.29, 0.55, 0.66, 0.81 \u2014 a ~0.6-wide monotone sweep crossing 50% between L5 and L8, with L7 sitting near 50% (cancellation cell: SPI's weighted evidence nearly vanishes while TTB is at full p*). No constant fits a sweep this wide that straddles 50%.\n\nCORE DISSOCIATION 2 (sign-robust direction conflicts): On X2 (trial 11: unanimous endorsement of A, B all zeros) TTB must pick A with p >= 0.51 at ANY (beta in [0.1,20], eps in [0,0.5]); SPI must pick B: E = -1, and even at its worst case (rho=0.35, eps=0.35, beta=0.5) p(A) <= 0.486 < 0.5. The same sign-robust conflict holds on L1 (E in [-0.875, -0.77]) and on the headline depth-2 cell Y1 (trial 9: cue 1 tied, cue 2 plus four low cues all endorse B, A empty \u2014 TTB winner B at p*, SPI p(TTB winner) <= 0.49 across its whole box because E in [+0.60, +0.63] makes empty A the sparse option). These cells dissociate the two theories in DIRECTION with sign robustness over both full parameter boxes.\n\nCORE DISSOCIATION 3 (depth): D1 and D3 (trials 7-8) replicate L5 and L8 with cue 2 (0.92) as first discriminator. TTB predicts EXACTLY the same p* as the depth-1 twins (depth invariance); SPI predicts nearly identical evidence (E differs only by w1-w2), so depth cells double as replication while testing TTB's structural claim that cue identity is irrelevant. Y1 extends depth to a 5-cue mass against the cue-2 winner \u2014 the largest direction conflict available at depth 2.\n\nANCHORS: X1 (trial 10: cue 1 endorses A, all seven other cues endorse B) is an extreme AGREEMENT cell \u2014 both theories pick A \u2014 but with graded SPI confidence (E in [+0.51, +0.75]); it verifies that SPI subjects are not simply anti-endorsement robots, since here the sparser option coincides with the top-cue option. Controls C1/C2 (trials 23-24: identical vectors, all-0 and all-1) check both theories' exact-50% guessing prediction and catch key bias. Every dissociating trial has a mirrored twin (A/B swapped, trials 12-22) so side bias cancels; analysis pools by TTB-winner side. 24 unique pairs x K=4 = exactly 96 trials, 8 observations per pooled cell per subject.\n\nDECISIVE QUANTITATIVE SIGNATURES: (a) Spearman correlation between cell choice proportion and SPI evidence E: strongly positive if SPI true, ~0 if TTB true; (b) p(TTB winner) < 0.5 on X2, L1, Y1 and their mirrors (sign-robust over both boxes) vs > 0.5 under TTB; (c) monotone ladder L1 < L4 < L5 < ~0.5 at L7 < L8 < L11 vs TTB's flat equality of all discriminating cells at one common p*; (d) L7 near 50% while L1/L11 are extreme \u2014 a confidence pattern TTB's two-level step function cannot produce, and conversely a flat p* that SPI's strictly monotone evidence-to-choice map cannot produce. This design differs from prior SPI-vs-TTB work by using the two-tier dominant-pair + counting-block architecture, the depth-2 mass-conflict cell Y1, and a cancellation cell placed exactly where SPI's weighted evidence vanishes.",
