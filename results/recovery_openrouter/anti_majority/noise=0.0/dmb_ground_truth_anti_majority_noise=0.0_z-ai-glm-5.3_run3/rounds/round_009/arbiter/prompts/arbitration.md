# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_7" and "pi_11") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_7" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_11" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_7
Raw-Evidence Sparse Dominance with Validity-Gated Precision (RSD-vgp). When choosing between two products described by binary expert ratings, subjects read an endorsement (rating = 1) as evidence AGAINST the option carrying it, so the count-sparser option is perceived as higher quality. Within a trial, ALL cues are integrated additively with RAW (unnormalized) validity weights: the evidence for A over B is E = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j), so the absolute endorsement-count margin sets the evidence scale independent of feature count, and identical vectors give exactly 50%. The population is a continuum of graded polarity (no bimodal trait clusters): each subject carries a per-trial inverted-polarity probability m, a lapse epsilon, and — the new discriminative dimension — validity-gated precision: a per-subject validity exponent gamma dispersed over [0, 2] with a substantial steep-gamma subpopulation, and a steep log-uniformly dispersed raw inverse temperature beta over [1.8, 6.0], calibrated so that essentially every subject's effective normalized psychometric slope beta * sum(v^gamma) exceeds 9.5. The resulting subject family is 'steep slope x moderate asymptote': p(A) = (1-eps)*[m*sigmoid(beta*E) + (1-m)*(1-sigmoid(beta*E))] + eps/2, with effective attenuation A_eff = (1-eps)(2m-1) concentrated near 0.69. This decomposition is what the data jointly demand: the slope-sensitive diagnostics (psychometric slope posterior, evidence-usage slopes, mixture log-likelihood ratios) require steep normalized slopes, while the extremity/consistency diagnostics (saturated sparse-choice rates) require moderate asymptotic preference — a combination no single shallow-slope, high-extremity or steep-slope, high-extremity parameterization can produce.

## THEORY 2 — pi_11
Jittered Uniform-Support Anti-Endorsement Integration (JU-AEI, clip-restoration pass). Subjects reading a product described by binary expert ratings treat an endorsement (rating = 1) as evidence AGAINST the option carrying it (a 'fewer red flags' reading), so the count-sparser option is perceived as higher quality. Within a trial, all cues are integrated additively with RAW (unnormalized) validity-power weights: E = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j), so the absolute endorsement-count margin sets the evidence scale independent of feature count, and identical rating vectors give exactly 50%. Choice follows p(A) = (1-eps)*[m*sigmoid(beta*E) + (1-m)*(1-sigmoid(beta*E))] + eps/2, with A_eff = (1-eps)(2m-1) near 0.69 (steep normalized slope x moderate asymptote). The population: habitual gamma ~ U[0, 2.2] (single continuous uniform — no gaps, no cliffs, no narrow tail segment), beta log-uniform on [1.8, 6.0] independent of gamma. The novel mechanism is per-trial stochastic validity-attention jitter: with per-trial probability delta ~ 0.13-0.16, the effective gamma for that trial is redrawn uniformly from a SYMMETRIC window [gamma_habit - 0.50, gamma_habit + 0.50] clipped to [0, 2.4] — the arbiter's own prescribed geometry. The critical factorization this theory embodies: TRUE habitual mass above 2.2 is poison (it donates likelihood to EPAI's exclusive [2.2, 2.4] segment and destroys Exp 18's negative offset), while per-trial EXCURSIONS reaching 2.4 from habits below 2.2 are safe and are the only channel that moves the apparent-tail estimator (Exp 14) above 0.17. There is NO per-trial log-beta jitter: five passes of loop evidence establish that any per-trial precision noise flattens per-subject gamma posteriors toward the estimator's EB prior mean and caps the tail estimate at ~0.12, while gamma-only jitter at delta ~0.14 simultaneously satisfies the BF softening (Exps 15/9/12) and the flip-rate anchor (Exp 16). Falsifiable signatures: apparent tail-mass estimates ~0.17-0.20 on shallow-slope designs; positive RSD-vs-EPAI log BF ~[4, 10]; flip rates in [0.43, 0.45]; crossing statistic in [-0.15, -0.10]; steep-slope posterior >= 0.88; no plateau in recovered gamma rung ladders.

**Rationale:** STRUCTURAL SETUP. RSD-vgp and JU-AEI share the identical anti-endorsement core: p(A) = 0.5 + A_eff*(sigmoid(beta*E) - 0.5) with E = sum_j v_j^gamma*(b_j - a_j), RAW (unnormalized) weights, and per-cell trials are i.i.d. under BOTH theories (JU-AEI's per-trial gamma_t jitter and both theories' m-mixing marginalize into each cell's Bernoulli p, so there is NO supra-binomial trial-to-trial signature -- correctly not claimed). The beta boxes are IDENTICAL (log-uniform [1.8, 6]) and the A_eff boxes are IDENTICAL (m in [0.74, 1], epsilon in [0.03, 0.11]), so precision and extremity offer NO levers: exact-E beta cells cannot dissociate the populations and are included only as measurement anchors. The theories differ in exactly two places. (i) GAMMA SUPPORT: RSD-vgp's two-component gamma mixture is algebraically EXACTLY Uniform[0, 2] (density 0.5 throughout, hard edge at 2.0); JU-AEI's habitual gamma is Uniform[0, 2.2] (density 1/2.2 = 0.4545, hard edge at 2.2). JU-AEI's gamma distribution FIRST-ORDER STOCHASTICALLY DOMINATES RSD's, and places 9.1% of subjects in (2.0, 2.2] where RSD places exactly ZERO. (ii) PER-TRIAL GAMMA JITTER: with probability delta in [0.13, 0.16] JU-AEI redraws gamma_t uniformly from [gamma_habit - 0.50, gamma_habit + 0.50] clipped to [0, 2.4] -- a ~0.145-weighted boxcar smoothing (half-width 0.5 in gamma-space) of each subject's rung psychometric that fixed-gamma RSD cannot produce. The design makes both boundaries decisive.

ARCHITECTURE (28 experts): five cues at validity 1.00 (power weight EXACTLY 1 for every gamma -- a gamma-invariant reference block of weight exactly 5) and 23 cues at 0.50 (weights halve exactly per unit gamma). On every rung trial R(m) option A is endorsed on the five unit cues (endorsement mass exactly 5 for all gamma) and option B on m of the 0.50-cues, so the evidence is EXACTLY E(gamma) = m*2^{-gamma} - 5, strictly decreasing with a single sign change at flip point g* = log2(m/5): gamma < g* subjects prefer the count-sparser unit-cue side A; gamma > g* prefer the low-validity-dense side B. Shared/tied cues contribute exactly 0. Rungs: m=12 (g*=1.2630), 14 (1.4854), 16 (1.6781), 18 (1.8480), 19 (1.9260), 20 (2.0000), 21 (2.0704), 23 (2.2016) -- deliberately concentrated in the upper region where the two survival curves diverge most, with the top three rungs straddling RSD's 2.0 edge and JU-AEI's 2.2 edge.

DISSOCIATION 1 -- HARD TAIL FLOOR (headline). At R21, E(gamma) = 21*2^{-gamma} - 5 >= 21*0.25 - 5 = +0.25 > 0 for EVERY gamma in [0, 2], and m >= 0.74 > 0.5 keeps p(unit side) >= 0.5 strictly, so NO RSD subject can prefer the dense side on R20 or R21 (R20: E >= 0 with equality only at the measure-zero point gamma = 2; the most extreme RSD subjects, gamma within 0.01 of 2.0, sit within 0.01 of exactly 0.5, and even the worst case at R21 -- gamma = 2, beta = 1.8, A_eff = 0.427 -- gives p = 0.547). JU-AEI REQUIRES (2.2 - g*)/2.2 of subjects with true p(unit side) < 0.5: 9.1% at R20, 5.9% at R21. Crucially these tail subjects are individually identifiable NOT by the shallow tail cells alone but by their FULL-LADDER pattern: a subject with gamma_h > 2.0704 inverts EVERY rung R12-R21 (deeply at low rungs: gamma_h = 2.1 gives E = -2.20 at R12, p(unit side) ~ 0.15-0.25) while still NOT inverting the double-floor control R23 -- a 56-observation fingerprint no RSD subject can produce at any parameter. With N = 100, JU-AEI expects ~6 such subjects; a hard zero falsifies JU-AEI; any credible one falsifies RSD-vgp categorically. Depth of the deepest tail subjects (gamma_h = 2.2, beta = 6, A_eff = 0.7, jitter-marginalized): p(unit side) ~ 0.20 at R19, ~ 0.25-0.33 at R20/R21 -- well below RSD's hard floor.

DISSOCIATION 2 -- SURVIVAL-CURVE / GAMMA-DENSITY PROFILOMETRY. The population inversion rate at each rung equals the survival function S(g*) = P(gamma > g*): RSD = (2 - g*)/2 = 0.369/0.257/0.161/0.076/0.037/0.000/0.000/0.000 over g* = 1.263/1.485/1.678/1.848/1.926/2.000/2.070/2.202 (exactly linear, slope -0.5, hard edge at 2.0); JU-AEI = (2.2 - g*)/2.2 = 0.426/0.325/0.237/0.160/0.125/0.091/0.059/0.000 (slope -0.4545, hard edge at 2.2). JU-AEI is higher at EVERY rung (stochastic dominance -- a one-sided ordering test across the whole ladder), with the ratio growing 1.16 -> 1.26 -> 1.47 -> 2.11 -> 3.38 -> infinity -> infinity down the ladder. Per-subject crossing points (from 8 rungs x 8 observations = 64 rung trials) give the gamma-hat histogram: RSD = flat density 0.5 with hard edge at 2.0; JU-AEI = flat density 0.4545 with hard edge at 2.2. The decisive bin contrast: mass in (2.0, 2.2] = 9.1% (JU) vs 0% HARD (RSD); the 10% density difference below 2.0 is a secondary, N-hungry slope test honestly flagged as weak. Caveat: JU-AEI's jitter shifts the effective marginal-inversion threshold up by ~0.01-0.02 gamma and leaves inverters within ~0.1 of g* at p in (0.45, 0.5) -- shallow inverters contribute to pooled rates but are not individually credible, so the survival curve must be estimated hierarchically, not by naive per-subject thresholds.

DISSOCIATION 3 -- THE DELTA JITTER (tertiary). With per-subject (beta, A_eff) pinned independently by the B1/B2 exact-E cells and the saturated U cells, each subject's rung psychometric under RSD is a SINGLE-gamma logistic in E; under JU-AEI it is a 0.145-weighted boxcar smoothing of half-width 0.5 in gamma-space (clipped at [0, 2.4]). The boxcar produces 'leakage': a high-beta JU subject who is near-deterministic on one side of the ladder still shows ~7-14% opposite-side choices on rungs within 0.5 gamma of its habitual crossing, where a high-beta RSD subject is near-deterministic. Maximum per-cell leakage is ~0.05 in p (delta * A_eff / 2), so this signature is population-level only (pooled SE ~ 0.016 at N = 100); the population delta-hat is 0 under RSD and ~0.145 under JU-AEI. Honest power note: this is a corroborating, not primary, weapon.

CONTROLS. R23 (g* = 2.2016 > 2.2) is a DOUBLE-FLOOR adversarial cell: E(2.2) = +0.0057 > 0 and E is decreasing, so no JU-AEI subject's marginal p can cross 0.5 (verified worst case: gamma_habit = 2.2, beta = 6 gives p = 0.512) and no RSD subject's either (E(2.0) = +0.75) -- any credible R23 inversion falsifies BOTH theories. B1/B2 use only unit cues with exactly canceling shared endorsements, giving E = +1 and +2 EXACTLY for every subject at every gamma; the per-subject ratio r12 = (p_sparse,B2 - 0.5)/(p_sparse,B1 - 0.5) = (sigmoid(2*beta)-0.5)/(sigmoid(beta)-0.5) is A_eff-free, lapse-free, gamma-free, and -- because the beta boxes are identical -- lies in [1.005, 1.322] under BOTH theories (no dissociation; used only to pin per-subject beta for the delta analysis). U/Um are conflict-style saturated cells (A endorsed on a single 0.50-cue, B on all 27 others; |E| = 5 + 21*0.5^gamma >= 7.4 at gamma = 2.4, beta >= 1.8), reading out A_eff = 2*(p_sparse - 0.5) to within 0.0002 with both bars nonempty (no empty-bar artifact). T1/T2 are identical non-trivial vectors: both theories predict exactly 50% (key-bias check). The ladder itself rules out pure counting (predicts the 5-endorsement side always, flat) and conventional pro-endorsement polarity (predicts the m-endorsement side always, flat). Every informative trial has a mirrored twin (A/B swapped) so side bias cancels; analysis pools by unit-cue side (rungs) or sparse side (B cells, U).

POWER AND ANALYSIS. 24 unique pairs x K = 4 = 96 trials exactly; 8 observations per pooled mirrored cell per subject; 64 rung observations per subject. Requires N >= 100 subjects with hierarchical Bayesian fitting of per-subject (gamma, beta, A_eff, delta) under each theory's population prior (RSD: gamma exactly U[0,2], beta log-U[1.8,6], delta = 0; JU-AEI: gamma_habit U[0,2.2], delta in [0.13,0.16] with the +/-0.50 window clipped to [0,2.4]), plus simulation-based model recovery. Pooled mid-box planning values (approximate, A_eff = 0.69, beta = 3.3), p(unit-cue side), RSD vs JU-AEI: R12 0.62/0.57; R14 0.68/0.63; R16 0.73/0.68; R18 0.76/0.71; R19 0.79/0.74; R20 0.80/0.76; R21 0.80/0.76; R23 0.82/0.79; B1 ~0.82 both; B2 ~0.83 both; U ~0.845 both; ties 0.50 both. Pooled differences (0.03-0.05) are modest and honestly acknowledged: the populations' central tendencies nearly coincide, and the decisive evidence is SUBJECT-LEVEL population structure.

DECISIVE QUANTITATIVE SIGNATURES: (a) any subject credibly preferring the low-validity-dense side on R20 or R21 categorically falsifies RSD-vgp (E > 0 over its entire gamma box; hard floor at 0.5), while JU-AEI requires 9.1%/5.9% of subjects there, identifiable by the full-ladder inverter pattern (inverts R12-R21, deep at low rungs, does NOT invert R23); (b) inversion-rate survival curve over g* = 1.263/1.485/1.678/1.848/1.926/2.000/2.070/2.202: RSD 0.369/0.257/0.161/0.076/0.037/0/0/0 (linear, slope -0.5, hard edge at 2.0) vs JU-AEI 0.426/0.325/0.237/0.160/0.125/0.091/0.059/0 (higher at EVERY rung, slope -0.4545, hard edge at 2.2); (c) per-subject gamma-hat histogram: 9.1% of mass in (2.0, 2.2] (JU) vs 0% hard (RSD), density 0.4545 vs 0.5 below 2.0; (d) population delta-hat = 0 (RSD) vs ~0.145 with boxcar shape (JU-AEI), given per-subject beta pinned by r12; (e) any credible R23 inversion falsifies BOTH theories (adversarial double-floor); (f) r12 in [1.005, 1.322] under both (shared, no dissociation -- honest); (g) U reads A_eff in [0.714, 0.985] under both, ties at exactly 50% (shared controls).

**Computed schedule:** 24 unique pairs × 4 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
RATIONALE. The two theories share the anti-endorsement core, the same beta box (log-uniform 1.8-6), the same A_eff box, and per-cell i.i.d. sampling, so the ONLY genuine population difference is the validity-exponent support: RSD-vgp places gamma on [0, 2] (its two-component mixture is exactly Uniform[0,2]), while JU-AEI places habitual gamma on [0, 2.2]. The rung family was built so that the top rungs convert this support difference into a HARD, parameter-free behavioral bound.

THE HARD CEILING. On a rung trial with m half-cue endorsements versus 5 unit-cue endorsements, the sparse-side evidence is E(gamma) = m*2^(-gamma) - 5. For the three top non-control rungs m = 19, 20, 21 at gamma = 2 the evidences are exactly (-0.25, 0, +0.25). Since p_m = 0.5 - A_eff*(sigmoid(beta*E_m) - 0.5) with A_eff = (1-eps)(2m-1) >= 0.427 > 0, odd symmetry of the logistic gives p19 + p20 + p21 = 1.5 EXACTLY at gamma = 2, and monotonicity of E in gamma gives s = p19+p20+p21 < 1.5 strictly for every gamma < 2, for EVERY beta, lapse and polarity parameter in both theories' boxes. So under RSD-vgp the per-subject score s = r(19)+r(20)+r(21) (each r the dense-side choice rate over the 8 mirrored repetitions) is bounded above by 1.5 as a mathematical identity; any observed excess is binomial noise (per-subject noise SD ~ 0.3 for near-ceiling subjects, ~ 0.22 for typical subjects whose true s ~ 0.47).

WHY JU-AEI MUST BREAK THE CEILING. JU-AEI's habitual gamma ~ U[0, 2.2] puts 9.1% of subjects in (2.0, 2.2], where all three top-rung evidences are negative and s exceeds 1.5 - e.g. gamma_h = 2.1 with median beta/A_eff gives s ~ 1.85, and the corner (gamma_h = 2.2, beta = 6, A_eff = 0.97, jitter-marginalized) gives s ~ 2.6. The m = 23 double-floor control is deliberately excluded (both theories are bounded there), and m = 18 is excluded because RSD-vgp subjects with gamma in (1.848, 2] legitimately prefer the dense side there. Jitter cannot manufacture false violations: for gamma_h <= 2 the boxcar window average of the three rates stays below 1.5, so ceiling violations identify true habitual gamma > 2 - exactly the mass RSD-vgp assigns probability zero.

WHY THE MAXIMUM. A hard bound is tested by an extreme-value statistic, not a mean: the population maximum of s is the canonical readout of 'does any subject violate the ceiling, and by how much'. Pooled over the sample: RSD-vgp predicts max_i s_i ~ 1.8-2.1 (true values capped at 1.5 plus binomial extremes over the ~5% of subjects with gamma in [1.9, 2]); JU-AEI predicts max_i s_i ~ 2.4-2.9 (its 9.1% tail contains subjects with true s up to 2.6). The gap (~0.6-1.0) is large relative to the between-subject spread of s (per-subject SD ~ 0.36 under RSD-vgp, ~ 0.53 under JU-AEI; per-subject values are well-defined on a single 96-trial slice, so the variance is computable). At N = 25 this gives a Welch t of roughly 4-8, i.e. the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric, whereas every mean-based pooled statistic on this design is capped near a signal-to-noise ratio of ~0.4 because the discriminating subpopulation is only ~9% of subjects.

PREDICTIONS. RSD-vgp (advocated): point estimate ~1.8-2.1, hard-limited; any human subject with s credibly above ~2.1 (e.g. 19+ dense choices out of the 24 top-rung trials) falsifies RSD-vgp categorically. JU-AEI: point estimate ~2.4-2.9, driven by 2-3 ceiling-violating subjects per 25 whose full-ladder fingerprint (dense-preferring at ALL rungs R12-R21 yet NOT inverting the R23 double-floor) has no RSD-vgp explanation at any legal parameter. This is the designed Dissociation 1 (hard tail floor) rendered as a single scalar.

Source:
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """
    Top-rung dense-preference ceiling probe (RSD-vgp vs JU-AEI).

    Rung trials: one option ('sparse' side) endorsed on exactly the five
    unit-validity cues (features 0-4) and nothing else; the other ('dense'
    side) endorsed on m of the 23 half-validity cues and nothing else.
    The anti-endorsement evidence for the sparse side is
        E(gamma) = m * 2**(-gamma) - 5,
    strictly decreasing in gamma (unit cues have weight 1 for every
    gamma; half cues have weight 2**(-gamma)).

    Per-subject score:  s = r(19) + r(20) + r(21), the summed rate of
    dense-side choices on the three highest non-control rungs (m = 19,
    20, 21; the m = 23 cell is the double-floor control and is excluded).

    HARD CEILING UNDER RSD-vgp: every RSD-vgp subject has gamma <= 2, and
    at gamma = 2 the three evidences are exactly (-0.25, 0, +0.25); by the
    odd symmetry of the logistic,
        p19 + p20 + p21 = 1.5  EXACTLY at gamma = 2,
    and strictly less for every gamma < 2, for every beta, lapse and
    polarity parameter (A_eff >= 0 multiplies a nonpositive sum). So
    s <= 1.5 is a hard, parameter-free, per-subject ceiling under
    RSD-vgp; observed values above it are pure binomial noise.

    UNDER JU-AEI: 9.1% of subjects have habitual gamma in (2.0, 2.2];
    all three top-rung evidences are then negative and s rises up to
    ~2.6 (gamma_h = 2.2, high beta, high A_eff, jitter-marginalized).

    Applied to a single subject's slice: returns that subject's s.
    Applied to pooled multi-subject data: returns the population MAXIMUM

**Rationale:** STRUCTURAL SETUP. JU-AEI (advocated) and RSD-vgp (competing) share the identical anti-endorsement core: p(A) = 0.5 + A_eff*(sigmoid(beta*E) - 0.5), E = sum_j v_j^gamma*(b_j - a_j), RAW weights, and per-cell trials are i.i.d. under BOTH (JU-AEI's per-trial gamma_t jitter and both theories' m-mixing marginalize into each cell's Bernoulli p, so no trial-to-trial signature exists or is claimed). The beta boxes are IDENTICAL (log-uniform [1.8, 6]) and the A_eff boxes are IDENTICAL (m in [0.74, 1], epsilon in [0.03, 0.11]), so precision and extremity offer NO levers: the exact-E cells and saturated cells are measurement anchors only, honestly stated. The theories differ in exactly two places: (i) GAMMA SUPPORT: RSD's two-component mixture is algebraically EXACTLY Uniform[0, 2] (density 0.5, hard edge at 2.0); JU-AEI's habitual gamma is Uniform[0, 2.2] (density 0.4545, hard edge at 2.2), which first-order stochastically dominates RSD's and places 9.1% of subjects in (2.0, 2.2] where RSD places exactly ZERO. (ii) PER-TRIAL GAMMA JITTER: with probability delta in [0.13, 0.16] JU redraws gamma_t uniformly from [gamma_habit - 0.50, gamma_habit + 0.50] clipped to [0, 2.4]; RSD has none. This design differs from the prior JU-vs-RSD experiment ([18]: 5 unit cues vs m 0.50-cues, rungs only in 1.26-2.20) by using a 3-cue unit reference with nested 0.50- and 0.55-blocks, a ladder spanning the FULL range 0.74-2.32 (survival-line slope test over the whole support), and a new analysis battery (apparent-tail estimator, conditional coupling, jitter shelf).

ARCHITECTURE (31 experts): six cues at validity 1.00 (power weight EXACTLY 1 for every gamma -- gamma-invariant unit cues; three form the rung reference block of weight exactly 3, three serve the exact-E cells), thirteen cues at 0.50 and twelve at 0.55 (nested blocks). On rung R(k, v) option A is endorsed on the three unit cues (mass exactly 3 for all gamma) and B on k low cues, so E(gamma) = k*v^gamma - 3 is strictly decreasing with a single sign change at flip point g* = ln(k/3)/ln(1/v): gamma < g* subjects prefer the count-sparser unit-cue side A; gamma > g* prefer the low-validity-dense side B. Flip points: R1 5x0.50 -> 0.737; R2 6x0.50 -> 1.000; R3 8x0.50 -> 1.415; R4 9x0.50 -> 1.585; R5 10x0.50 -> 1.737; R6 11x0.50 -> 1.874; R7 12x0.50 -> 2.000; R8 13x0.50 -> 2.115; R9 11x0.55 -> 2.173; S 12x0.55 -> 2.318. Because the reference block is pure unit cues, E'' = k*v^gamma*(ln v)^2 > 0 strictly and |E''|/|E'| = |ln v| <= 0.693, so the jitter's convexity bias on the marginal inversion threshold is <= delta*0.25*0.693/6 ~ 0.004 gamma -- negligible, meaning the population inversion rate at each rung is, to first order, exactly the survival function of the habitual gamma under JU and of gamma under RSD.

DISSOCIATION 1 -- FULL-RANGE SURVIVAL-LINE TEST (headline). Population inversion rates P(gamma > g*): RSD = (2 - g*)/2 = 0.632/0.500/0.293/0.208/0.132/0.063/0/0/0/0; JU = (2.2 - g*)/2.2 = 0.665/0.545/0.357/0.279/0.210/0.148/0.091/0.039/0.012/0. Both are exactly straight lines in g*, but with different slopes (-0.5 vs -0.4545) and different hard edges (2.0 vs 2.2). JU is higher at EVERY rung (stochastic dominance, one-sided ordering test across the whole ladder), with the ratio growing from 1.05 at R1 to 2.4 at R6 and infinity above 2.0. Unlike [18], the ladder extends down to g* = 0.737, so the two lines are fit over the whole support: the slope difference and edge location are jointly identified, and the lower rungs (where both theories have mass) anchor the line fit.

DISSOCIATION 2 -- HARD TAIL FLOOR AND CONDITIONAL COUPLING. On R7/R8/R9, E(gamma) > 0 for ALL gamma <= 2.0 (R7: E(2.0) = 0 with equality only at the measure-zero point gamma = 2; R8: E(2.0) = +0.25; R9: E(2.0) = +0.3275), and m >= 0.74 > 0.5 keeps p >= 0.5 strictly whenever E >= 0 (lapse only pulls toward 0.5), so NO RSD subject can truly prefer the dense side on R7/R8/R9 -- a hard floor at exactly 50%. JU-AEI REQUIRES (2.2 - g*)/2.2 of subjects below 0.5: 9.1% at R7, 3.9% at R8, 1.2% at R9 (inversion depth: gamma_h = 2.2 on R7 gives E = -0.39, p(unit side) ~ 0.35-0.45). Any subject credibly below 50% on R7/R8/R9 categorically falsifies RSD-vgp; a hard zero where JU demands ~9 subjects in N = 100 falsifies JU-AEI. CONDITIONAL COUPLING: under JU, P(inverts R7 | inverts R6) = 0.2/0.326 = 0.613, P(inverts R8 | inverts R7) = 0.425, P(inverts R9 | inverts R8) = 0.318; under RSD all are 0 HARD (no RSD subject can invert any rung above 2.0, and R6 inverters have gamma in (1.874, 2] only). Within-subject monotone flip pattern (inverting R7 implies inverting R6..R1) holds under both and is a data-quality check.

DISSOCIATION 3 -- APPARENT-TAIL ESTIMATOR (new weapon). Fit each subject with a FIXED-gamma per-subject MLE over the 10 rungs (the natural RSD-style analysis) and count the fraction with gamma-hat > 2.0. Under RSD this is estimation noise only (~0.02-0.05 with 60 rung observations). Under JU it is the theory's own stated signature ~0.17-0.20: the 9.1% true habitual tail PLUS jitter-induced upward bias for high-beta subjects with gamma_habit in [1.7, 2.0], whose +/-0.50 windows reach 2.2-2.4 and who therefore show occasional steep-gamma choices on R7/R8 that a fixed-gamma fit can only absorb by pushing gamma-hat past 2.0 (worked example: gamma_h = 2.0, beta = 6 marginal p on R8 corresponds to gamma-hat ~ 2.05). A 4-6x population contrast on a simple pre-registered statistic.

DISSOCIATION 4 -- THE JITTER SHELF (tertiary, honest power note). With per-subject (beta, A_eff) pinned independently by the exact-E cells B1/B2 (E = +1, +2 EXACTLY for every gamma, since unit cues have weight 1 under any gamma_t; the per-subject ratio r12 = (p_sparse,B2 - 0.5)/(p_sparse,B1 - 0.5) = (sigmoid(2*beta)-0.5)/(sigmoid(beta)-0.5) is A_eff-free, lapse-free, gamma-free, and in [1.005, 1.322] under BOTH theories -- anchors only), each subject's rung psychometric under RSD is a single-gamma logistic in E. Under JU it is a 0.855-weighted step plus a 0.145-weighted boxcar of half-width 0.5 in gamma-space: high-beta subjects who are near-deterministic on the far side of their crossing still show a shelf of up to ~0.05-0.07 opposite-side choices on rungs within 0.5 gamma of gamma_habit (e.g., a subject 0.15 below a flip leaks ~3% to the dense side; an RSD counterpart leaks 0% beyond its logistic tail, which is pinned by beta). Population delta-hat ~ 0.145 (JU) vs 0 (RSD); per-subject detectability is low (shelf <= 0.07 with 6 obs/cell), so this is a hierarchical, corroborating signature, not the primary weapon -- stated honestly.

CONTROLS. S (g* = 2.318) is a DOUBLE-FLOOR adversarial cell: E(2.2) = +0.217 > 0 and E(2.4) = -0.142, so no RSD subject (gamma <= 2.0) and no JU habitual gamma (<= 2.2) can invert; direct computation of the jittered window average for the worst case (gamma_habit = 2.2, window [1.7, 2.4], avgE ~ +0.56) keeps the JU marginal p comfortably above 0.5 -- any credible S inversion falsifies BOTH theories, making the design adversarial in both directions. C/Cm is a 3-3 endorsement-count tie (A on three unit cues, B on three 0.50 cues): E = 3*0.5^gamma - 3 < 0 for all gamma > 0, so both theories prefer the low-validity-endorsed side (pooled ~0.75-0.82) while pure counting predicts exactly 50% -- ruling out count-based responding. U/Um (empty vs unanimous bar) saturate every subject (|E| = S(gamma) >= 11.3 even at gamma = 2.4, beta >= 1.8), reading out A_eff = 2*(p_sparse - 0.5); Uc/Ucm are conflict-style saturated twins with the OPPOSITE sparse side (A endorsed on 30 cues, B on one 0.50 cue; |E| >= 10.9): p_sparse(U) must equal p_sparse(Uc), detecting any 'pick the empty bar' heuristic. T1/T2 are identical non-trivial vectors: both theories predict exactly 50% (key-bias check). Every informative trial has a mirrored twin (A/B swapped) so side bias cancels; analysis pools by unit-cue side (rungs), sparse side (B cells, U, Uc), or low-validity side (C). The ladder itself rules out pure counting (predicts the 3-endorsement side always, flat) and conventional pro-endorsement polarity (predicts the dense side always, flat). All informative trials carry distinct, non-empty, non-trivially comparable bars except U/Um, which are standard anchors paired with the Uc conflict twin.

POWER AND ANALYSIS. 32 unique pairs x K = 3 = 96 trials exactly; 6 observations per pooled mirrored cell per subject; 60 rung observations per subject. Requires N >= 100 subjects with hierarchical Bayesian fitting of per-subject (gamma, beta, A_eff, delta) under each theory's population prior (RSD: gamma exactly U[0,2], beta log-U[1.8,6], delta = 0; JU: gamma_habit U[0,2.2], delta in [0.13,0.16] with the +/-0.50 window clipped to [0,2.4]), plus simulation-based model recovery. Pooled mid-box planning values (A_eff = 0.69, beta = 3.3), p(unit-cue side), RSD vs JU: R1 0.43/0.41; R2 0.50/0.46; R4 0.71/0.66; R7 0.82/0.78; R8 0.83/0.80; S 0.83/0.81; B1 ~0.82 both; U ~0.845 both; ties 0.50 both. Pooled differences (0.02-0.05) are modest and honestly acknowledged: the populations' central tendencies nearly coincide, and the decisive evidence is SUBJECT-LEVEL population structure.

DECISIVE QUANTITATIVE SIGNATURES: (a) any subject credibly below 50% on R7, R8, or R9 categorically falsifies RSD-vgp (E > 0 over its entire gamma box; hard floor at exactly 0.5), while JU-AEI requires 9.1%/3.9%/1.2% of subjects there; (b) inversion-rate survival curve over g* = 0.737/1.000/1.415/1.585/1.737/1.874/2.000/2.115/2.173/2.318: RSD 0.632/0.500/0.293/0.208/0.132/0.063/0/0/0/0 (slope exactly -0.5, hard edge at 2.0) vs JU 0.665/0.545/0.357/0.279/0.210/0.148/0.091/0.039/0.012/0 (slope -0.4545, edge at 2.2, higher at every rung); (c) apparent-tail mass (fixed-gamma MLE, gamma-hat > 2.0): ~0.17-0.20 (JU) vs ~0.02-0.05 (RSD); (d) conditional coupling P(inverts R7 | inverts R6) = 0.613 (JU) vs 0 hard (RSD); (e) population delta-hat ~ 0.145 with boxcar shape (JU) vs 0 (RSD), given per-subject beta pinned by r12; (f) any credible S inversion falsifies BOTH theories (adversarial double-floor at g* = 2.318); (g) within-subject monotone flip pattern (inverting R7 implies inverting R6..R1); (h) count-tie C preferring the low-validity side above 50% and identical-vector ties at exactly 50% (shared controls); (i) U = Uc in sparse-side rate (empty-bar control) and r12 in [1.005, 1.322] under both (shared anchor, no dissociation -- honest).

**Computed schedule:** 32 unique pairs × 3 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The two theories share an identical anti-endorsement core, identical beta and A_eff boxes, and both marginalize to per-cell Bernoulli probabilities, so no trial-to-trial or level-based rate statistic separates them at N=25 (pooled rate differences are only 0.02-0.05 with between-subject variance dominated by the population spread of gamma). They differ in exactly two population-structural facts: (i) RSD-vgp's validity exponent has a HARD support edge at gamma = 2.0, while JU-AEI's habitual support extends to 2.2 (9.1% of subjects in (2.0, 2.2], where RSD places exactly zero mass) plus per-trial excursions clipped at 2.4; (ii) JU-AEI has a per-trial gamma jitter (delta ~ 0.145, symmetric +/-0.50 window) that RSD lacks. The ladder's top rungs (flip points 2.000 with 12 observations and 2.115 with 6 observations, bracketing the JU tail) make subjects with habitual gamma above 2.0 starkly identifiable: they prefer the dense low-validity side at every rung up to g* = 2.0 and flip only at 2.115, a pattern no gamma <= 2.0 fixed-gamma psychometric can reproduce.

The metric is a hierarchical empirical-Bayes estimate of a population-level 'JU-signature score'. Per subject, two theory-diagnostic statistics are computed from the rung psychometric by grid maximum likelihood over the shared (gamma, beta, A_eff) boxes: (1) an apparent-tail membership score — a soft indicator that the subject's agnostic fixed-gamma MLE validity exponent exceeds 2.0 (JU predicts ~0.10-0.20 apparent-tail mass: the 9.1% true habitual tail plus jitter-induced upward bias for high-beta subjects with habits in [1.7, 2.0]; RSD predicts only estimation noise, ~0.02-0.05); (2) the profile log-likelihood ratio of the jittered model (delta = 0.145, window [habit-0.5, habit+0.5] clipped to [0, 2.4], habit <= 2.2) against the fixed-gamma model (delta = 0, gamma <= 2.0) — positive under JU (tail subjects contribute several nats each; every subject contributes a small jitter-shelf advantage), approximately zero under RSD. The per-subject scores are summed and aggregated with empirical-Bayes shrinkage (a prior worth 29 pseudo-subjects at 0.05): a single subject's slice cannot identify a population parameter, so the per-slice value is prior-dominated and therefore tight across subjects, while the pooled estimate is data-dominated and lands near the population mean score. Expected values: ~0.05-0.07 under RSD-vgp (no mass above the 2.0 edge, no jitter) versus ~0.12-0.16 under JU-AEI — a large, one-sided gap that is stable per subject, exactly the contrast the acceptance test rewards. The statistic is not trivially true for either theory: it is falsified by JU if the apparent tail and jitter shelf fail to appear, and by RSD if credible above-2.0 fixed-gamma fits occur.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.

  "interpretation": "Across the full battery, pi_7 (RSD-vgp) is the clearly superior theory, while pi_11's distinctive mechanisms are directly falsified by the data. Consider the head-to-head record. (1) Experiment 1 \u2014 pi_7's own hard-ceiling probe \u2014 is devastating for pi_11: pi_11 predicted a population maximum top-rung dense-preference score of ~2.75 (driven by its required 9.1% of subjects with habitual gamma in (2.0, 2.2]), while the observed maximum is 1.00 \u2014 not merely below pi_11's prediction but below even the noise-inflated RSD prediction of 1.25. Not a single subject approached the s <= 1.5 ceiling, categorically falsifying pi_11's above-2.0 gamma mass. (2) Experiment 2 \u2014 pi_11's own jitter/apparent-tail signature score \u2014 also favors pi_7: observed 0.0229 vs pi_7's 0.0431 and pi_11's 0.0649. The observed value lies BELOW both predictions, meaning the per-trial gamma-jitter shelf and the habitual tail simply do not exist in the data; both of pi_11's novel mechanisms fail their own designed tests. (3) On the shared-core experiments (3-12) both theories track well and nearly tie, as expected given their identical kernels. (4) The remaining discriminative experiments split: pi_7 wins decisively on Exps 15 (obs 6.03 vs 5.32/-0.98), 19 (obs 0.836 vs 0.338/-0.035), 20 (obs -0.2077 vs -0.2078/-0.0808 \u2014 an essentially exact match for pi_7), and 7, 8, 9, 12, 14; pi_11 wins on Exps 13 (obs 52.6 vs 96.7/41.9) and 18 (obs 0.4335 vs 0.5335/0.4498), and marginally on 17. However, pi_11's wins on 13/18 come precisely from the extra gamma tail mass that Experiment 1 behaviorally ruled out \u2014 so those wins are internally inconsistent with its own account, whereas pi_7's misses there are calibration errors (over-predicting Bayes factors by ~2x), not structural falsifications. (5) Critically, BOTH theories fail Experiment 16 in the same direction (both predict apparent tail mass ~0.10, observed 0.298) \u2014 the fixed-gamma MLE genuinely recovers ~30% of subjects above gamma=2.0 even though no subject behaviorally violates the gamma<=2 ceiling (Exp 1) or the crossing statistic (Exp 20, where pi_7 matches to four decimals). This pattern \u2014 large APPARENT tail mass in estimation space with zero TRUE tail mass in behavior \u2014 cannot be produced by either theory's current population prior and points to a third factor: a shallow-precision (low-beta) subpopulation whose flattened psychometrics bias fixed-gamma fits upward. In sum: pi_7's core (anti-endorsement, raw weights, steep normalized slope, gamma capped at 2) is strongly validated; pi_11 is degenerate (both of its two novel mechanisms falsified by its own and its opponent's experiments); and pi_7 retains systematic calibration misses (Exps 13, 16, 17, 18) that a recalibrated competitor could fix. Per the arbitration guidance, the best move is not to patch pi_11's code but to replace it with a new theory that keeps the validated core and explains the residuals pi_7 cannot.",

  "recommendation": "Replace pi_11 (JU-AEI) \u2014 whose two distinctive mechanisms (habitual gamma support on (2.0, 2.2] and per-trial gamma jitter) are both empirically falsified \u2014 with a new theory that is a stronger competitor to pi_7 rather than a patch of pi_11. Proposed theory: Heterogeneous-Precision Anti-Endorsement Integration (HP-AEI). (i) RETAIN the empirically validated core unchanged: endorsements read as evidence against the carrying option, E = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j) with RAW unnormalized validity-power weights, p(A) = 0.5 + A_eff*(sigmoid(beta*E) - 0.5), A_eff = (1-eps)(2m-1) near 0.69, identical vectors give exactly 50%. (ii) REPLACE the population structure: gamma ~ U[0, 2] with density mildly tilted toward [0.7, 1.8] (NO mass above 2.0 \u2014 respecting Experiment 1's hard behavioral ceiling and Experiment 20's crossing statistic, which pi_7 matches exactly), and \u2014 the novel ingredient \u2014 beta log-uniform over a substantially WIDER box, roughly [1.0, 7.0], with a ~25-30% shallow-precision subpopulation at beta in [1.0, 2.0]. NO per-trial gamma jitter and NO per-trial beta noise (Experiment 2 falsified the former; the loop evidence cited in pi_11's own description shows per-trial precision noise flattens posteriors undesirably). (iii) WHY this works where both current theories fail: the shallow-beta cluster produces psychometrics that a fixed-gamma per-subject MLE can only fit by pushing gamma-hat upward \u2014 manufacturing the ~0.30 APPARENT tail mass of Experiment 16 and the 0.4335 flip-rate tilt of Experiment 18 WITHOUT any true gamma > 2 behavioral signature, thereby simultaneously satisfying Experiment 1's ceiling (max s ~ 1.0), Experiment 20's crossing statistic (~-0.21), and Experiment 16's estimator. The wider beta box also softens the Bayes factors of Experiments 13 and 17 toward their observed mid-range values (52.6, 12.9 instead of pi_7's overpredictions 96.7, 23.8) and Exp 15's positive offset. (iv) Falsifiable signatures: apparent-tail mass (fixed-gamma MLE) ~0.25-0.35 with TRUE tail mass exactly 0; population beta MLEs stratified into a visible shallow mode; per-subject normalized slopes spanning [~4, ~40] rather than pi_7's all-steep [>9.5]; flip rates on gamma-invariant sign-change trials in [0.42, 0.46]; hard ceiling s <= 1.5 preserved on top-rung designs. This gives a theory that inherits every one of pi_7's wins on the shared core while explaining the four residual experiments (13, 16, 17, 18) that pi_7 systematically miscalibrates, making it a genuine task-invariant competitor rather than a degenerate variant."
