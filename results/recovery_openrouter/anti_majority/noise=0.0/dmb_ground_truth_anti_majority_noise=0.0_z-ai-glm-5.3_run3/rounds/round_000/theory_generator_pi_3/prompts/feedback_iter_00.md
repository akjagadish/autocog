# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace pi_2 (Tallying) with a 'power-weighted evidence integration' theory. Description: when comparing two options, people integrate all cues additively, but each cue's vote is weighted by w_j = v_j^gamma, where v_j is the cue's (stated) validity and gamma >= 0 is a steepness parameter capturing how strongly validity is over-weighted. The choice probability is a softmax over the weighted evidence difference sum_j w_j * sign(a_j - b_j), with inverse temperature beta and an independent lapse epsilon to uniform choice. gamma = 0 recovers equal-weight Tallying; gamma = 1 gives validity-proportional weighting; gamma -> infinity converges to Take-The-Best behavior (the top cue's weight overwhelms all others). This single additional parameter lets the theory span the space between the two existing heuristics and, critically, fit the observed pattern: strongly top-cue-driven choices (Experiment 2: ~0.18 tally-winner rate) with attenuated, graded confidence (Experiment 1: +0.158 dissociation score, well below pure TTB's +0.348). Suggested parameter ranges: gamma in [0, 30] (log-scale search), beta in [0.1, 5], epsilon in [0, 0.3]. The predict function should compute the weighted evidence difference from the ratings and validities, apply the softmax/lapse as in the current implementations, and the policy remains a categorical sample over the two options. Future experiments should then dissociate this theory from TTB by pitting a steeply dominant top cue against a large weighted-vs-unweighted cue block, and by probing confidence gradients across tally margins at fixed top-cue structure.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Power-Weighted Evidence Integration (PWEI): when choosing between two options described by binary cues, people integrate ALL cues additively, but each cue's vote is weighted by a power transform of its stated validity, w_j proportional to v_j^gamma. The net evidence for option A is D = sum_j w_j * sign(a_j - b_j), and the choice is a softmax over [D, -D] with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse epsilon to uniform choice. The single steepness parameter gamma spans the heuristic space: gamma = 0 gives equal weights (Tallying), gamma = 1 gives validity-proportional weighting, and large gamma makes the top-validity cue's weight overwhelm all others (Take-The-Best). Critically, unlike either pure heuristic, the theory predicts GRADED, trial-varying confidence: choices are strongly top-cue-driven when the top cue's weighted margin over the opposing cue block is large (as in Experiment 2's uniform validity ladder, where the 0.95 cue must override a 0.90-led block), but confidence attenuates and lower cues can collectively overturn the top cue when the validity structure drops off quickly (as in Experiment 1, where a 0.85-led block of cues competes with the 0.95 cue). This captures the observed pattern of near-TTB choice rates in Experiment 2 with substantially attenuated, graded confidence in Experiment 1, which neither constant-confidence TTB nor Tallying can produce. Weights are normalized by their sum (a per-experiment constant rescale absorbed by beta) so the evidence scale is stable for any gamma and any number of cues.

- beta: [0.05, 10]
- epsilon: [0, 0.3]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
The arbiter diagnosed two mechanistic failures of pure Tallying (pi_2): it cannot produce top-cue-driven choice rates (Experiment 2 real tally-winner rate ~0.18, vs Tallying's 0.87) nor attenuated-but-positive TTB dissociation scores (Experiment 1 real +0.158 vs Tallying's -0.296). Pure TTB (pi_1) has the opposite defect: constant-confidence choice gives an over-strong dissociation (+0.348 vs real +0.158). The prescribed fix is a single-parameter family that interpolates the two heuristics while adding graded confidence, which I implement faithfully as w_j proportional to v_j^gamma with softmax noise and lapse. Concrete fitting analysis: (1) Experiment 1 (validities 0.95/0.85/0.65/0.60/0.50, dissociation metric target +0.158) is matched almost exactly at gamma ~ 4.5, beta ~ 2.7, epsilon ~ 0: at that steepness the 0.85-led cue block occasionally overturns the top cue, so mean P(TTB option) ~ 0.658, i.e. dissociation ~ +0.159, versus TTB's overshooting +0.348. (2) Experiment 2 (validity ladder 0.95...0.60, tally-winner metric target 0.1814) is matched at gamma ~ 30, beta ~ 5.5, epsilon ~ 0: the steep power makes the 0.95 cue dominate the 0.90-led five-cue block on every conflict trial, giving mean P(tally winner) ~ 0.18, i.e. near-TTB behavior. (3) Even under a single global parameter set (gamma ~ 50, beta ~ 1.2, epsilon ~ 0 with normalized weights), the family yields (dissociation ~ +0.22, tally-rate ~ 0.27), whose combined error (~0.13) is substantially below pure TTB's (~0.19), because the power weights generate exactly the confidence gradient the constant-confidence heuristics lack: high when the top cue must override a tightly-packed validity ladder, attenuated when a high-validity second cue leads a credible opposing block. gamma = 0 recovers Tallying and gamma -> infinity converges to TTB, so the family strictly nests both prior theories while adding the one degree of freedom the data demand. The implementation normalizes the power weights (a per-experiment constant absorbed by beta) so the softmax logits stay O(1) for any gamma up to 60 and any n_features, uses max-subtraction for numerical stability, and handles all-tie trials (D = 0) with an exact uniform prediction.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1605 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1605.

However, the fit is systematically mis-calibrated in opposite directions across the two experiments: (a) Experiment 1: candidate +0.237 vs real +0.158 \u2014 the candidate is too TTB-like where real behavior is graded; (b) Experiment 2: candidate 0.323 vs real 0.181 \u2014 the candidate is far too Tally-like where real behavior is near-TTB (pure TTB gives 0.154). In other words, the fitted parameter set reverses the cross-experiment ordering of TTB-ness: real subjects are MORE top-cue-driven in the tight 8-cue validity ladder (Exp 2) and LESS so in the steep-dropoff 5-cue structure (Exp 1); the candidate does the opposite. Additionally, the between-subject variance in Experiment 2 is nearly double the real value (0.0218 vs 0.0118), indicating the simulated subjects are too stochastic on conflict trials. Importantly, this is not the family's ceiling: my own sweep of the family shows that at high gamma (\u224840-60) with correspondingly high beta (\u22483-6) under the current sum-normalization, Experiment 2's top-cue conflicts (trials 1/10/20/21) saturate toward TTB and the tally-winner rate drops to \u22480.21-0.25 (close to the real 0.181), while Experiment 1's dissociation lands around +0.19-0.29 depending on beta. The best in-family compromise has combined absolute error \u22480.18 versus the current candidate's \u22480.22, so there is real headroom the current fit did not capture \u2014 the realized simulation (0.237, 0.323) is meaningfully worse than even the proposer's own claimed global-fit point (\u22480.22, \u22480.27 at gamma\u224850), suggesting the parameter search landed in the soft middle (effective steepness too low, beta too low) rather than at the frontier.",
