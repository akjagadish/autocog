# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_8`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_8`).

Replace pi_8 (EPAI-xp) with a new theory — Stochastic-Gate Anti-Endorsement Integration (SGAI) — that keeps the empirically confirmed core (endorsements read as evidence AGAINST the endorsed option; E = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j) with RAW unnormalized validity weights; p(A) = (1-eps)*[m*sigmoid(beta*E) + (1-m)*(1-sigmoid(beta*E))] + eps/2) but revises the population and adds within-subject noise, targeting exactly the three failures: (i) TRIAL-LEVEL ATTENTION GATE: on each trial, with probability delta in [0.10, 0.25], the subject re-samples cue attention, drawing an effective per-trial gamma_t from a wide distribution around their mean gamma (or falling back to raw cue counting); this within-subject jitter flattens per-subject gamma identification, which reproduces Experiment 2's inflated tail-mass estimate (~0.25-0.32 vs observed 0.298) WITHOUT placing genuine mass above gamma = 2.2, so Experiment 1's RSD-vs-EPAI log Bayes factor stays mildly positive (~+3 to +7, matching observed +6.03 and avoiding EPAI's -31). (ii) POPULATION PRIORS: gamma from a mixture with mean ~1.0 and support [0, 2.2] — predominantly below 2 with only a 5-10% sliver in (2.0, 2.2] (no mass above 2.2, so Exp 1 stays safe); beta log-uniform on [1.6, 6.0] (floor slightly BELOW RSD's 1.8, since Exps 13/14 hint at lower-precision subjects than either theory admits); m in [0.76, 0.98] and epsilon in [0.03, 0.12], keeping mean A_eff ~0.65-0.70 to preserve the good fits on Exps 9 and 10. (iii) LOW-PRECISION SUBPOPULATION: 10-15% of subjects with beta near the floor and elevated epsilon (0.15-0.25), absorbing the shallow-slope / GSP-ward drift seen in Experiments 13 (predicted ~45-60 vs observed 52.6, fixing RSD's 96.7 over-prediction) and 14 (predicted ~-0.38 to -0.45 vs observed -0.414). Because the per-trial core is unchanged, Experiments 3-10 and 12 should remain well fit; the new degrees of freedom (delta, gamma jitter width, low-precision mixture weight) are each pinned by a currently-missed experiment (2, 13/14, 11 respectively), giving the new theory falsifiable signatures distinct from both pi_7 (hard gamma <= 2, noise-free) and pi_8 (gamma mass in (2.0, 2.4], beta floor 2.0): per-subject psychometric functions with shallower mid-slope than their saturated asymptote implies, elevated trial-to-trial inconsistency on repeated identical trials beyond binomial noise, and a positive-but-attenuated Exp 1 log Bayes factor.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.898)

**Description**
Raw-Evidence Sparse Dominance with Validity-Gated Precision (RSD-vgp). When choosing between two products described by binary expert ratings, subjects read an endorsement (rating = 1) as evidence AGAINST the option carrying it, so the count-sparser option is perceived as higher quality. Within a trial, ALL cues are integrated additively with RAW (unnormalized) validity weights: the evidence for A over B is E = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j), so the absolute endorsement-count margin sets the evidence scale independent of feature count, and identical vectors give exactly 50%. The population is a continuum of graded polarity (no bimodal trait clusters): each subject carries a per-trial inverted-polarity probability m, a lapse epsilon, and — the new discriminative dimension — validity-gated precision: a per-subject validity exponent gamma dispersed over [0, 2] with a substantial steep-gamma subpopulation, and a steep log-uniformly dispersed raw inverse temperature beta over [1.8, 6.0], calibrated so that essentially every subject's effective normalized psychometric slope beta * sum(v^gamma) exceeds 9.5. The resulting subject family is 'steep slope x moderate asymptote': p(A) = (1-eps)*[m*sigmoid(beta*E) + (1-m)*(1-sigmoid(beta*E))] + eps/2, with effective attenuation A_eff = (1-eps)(2m-1) concentrated near 0.69. This decomposition is what the data jointly demand: the slope-sensitive diagnostics (psychometric slope posterior, evidence-usage slopes, mixture log-likelihood ratios) require steep normalized slopes, while the extremity/consistency diagnostics (saturated sparse-choice rates) require moderate asymptotic preference — a combination no single shallow-slope, high-extremity or steep-slope, high-extremity parameterization can produce.

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.819)

**Description**
Extended-Precision Anti-Endorsement Integration (EPAI-xp). Subjects reading a product described by binary expert ratings treat an endorsement (rating = 1) as evidence AGAINST the option carrying it — a 'fewer red flags' / rarity-implies-quality reading — so the count-sparser option is perceived as higher quality. Within a trial, ALL cues are integrated additively with RAW (unnormalized) validity weights: the evidence for A over B is E = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j), so the absolute endorsement-count margin sets the evidence scale independent of feature count, and identical rating vectors give exactly 50%. Each subject carries a per-trial inverted-polarity probability m, a lapse epsilon, a raw inverse temperature beta, and a validity exponent gamma, combined as p(A) = (1-eps)*[m*sigmoid(beta*E) + (1-m)*(1-sigmoid(beta*E))] + eps/2. The population (the 'xp' extension) is characterized by three refinements: (i) gamma follows a concave-then-heavy two-component mixture on [0, 2.4] — 55% uniform on [0, 1.2] and 45% uniform on [1.2, 2.4] — placing roughly 30-35% of subjects above gamma = 1.5 (more than RSD's 25%) while extending support past 2.0 to absorb the observation that steep-gamma subjects behave somewhat shallower than a hard uniform-[0,2] edge would predict; (ii) beta is log-uniform on [2.0, 7.0], raising the floor above RSD's 1.8 (no evidence of any subject below ~1.8) and extending the ceiling to 7 to steepen probe confidence; (iii) m in [0.78, 0.96] and epsilon in [0.03, 0.10] keep the mean effective attenuation A_eff = (1-eps)(2m-1) near 0.68-0.72, matching observed extremity anchors. The resulting subject family is 'steep normalized slope x moderate asymptote': essentially every subject's effective normalized psychometric slope beta * sum(v^gamma) is far above the 9.5 threshold that separates raw-weight from normalized-weight integration, while asymptotic preference stays moderate. This yields falsifiable predictions distinct from RSD-vgp: a non-uniform gamma histogram with mass above 2.0, a beta floor at 2.0 rather than 1.8, per-subject flip-ladder inversion rates on F3/F4 of ~20-27%/6-8%, and deeper Exp 11-style deviations.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.683)

**Description**
Graded Sparse-Preference with Heterogeneous Attenuation (GSP), unnormalized-evidence variant. Subjects integrate ALL cues additively with near-flat validity weighting under an anti-endorsement (sparse-preferring) reading: the evidence for option A over B is E = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j), where each endorsement (rating = 1) carried by an option counts AGAINST it, so the sparser option accumulates evidence. The cue weights are used RAW (v_j^gamma, unnormalized) so the evidence scale preserves the ABSOLUTE endorsement-count margin of the trial independent of the experiment's feature count — the cross-experiment scale separation (moderate pooled preference on 5-cue shallow-margin trials vs strong preference on 8-cue margin-2 conflicts) that per-experiment normalization provably erases. The anti-endorsement reading is graded per subject: each subject carries a continuous polarity weight m in [0.75, 1.0] (per-trial probability of responding with the inverted polarity), a log-uniformly dispersed inverse temperature beta, and a lapse epsilon in [0.02, 0.12]: p(A) = (1-eps)*[m*sigmoid(beta*E) + (1-m)*(1-sigmoid(beta*E))] + eps/2, with identical rating vectors yielding exactly 50%. The population is a continuum of attenuations concentrated on the inverted side (no empty middle, no mirror cluster), with mean effective attenuation (1-eps)(2m-1) ~ 0.70 matching the observed extremity anchors.

    Three structurally identified trial classes (validity order is fixed:
    [0.90, 0.89, 0.88, 0.87, 0.70, 0.60]):

    HIGH  - the top cue (0.90) discriminates and every other discriminating
            cue agrees with it (design trials 1, 2, 9, 10; 24 obs/subject).
            PWEI evidence margin |D| is maximal (~1 or w_top).
    DEPTH5- cues 1-4 all tie; only the 0.70-validity cue discriminates
            (design trials 11, 12; 12 obs/subject). PWEI's weight for
            0.70^gamma is ~1e-5 of total, so PWEI predicts ~50% choices.
    REV   - the top cue discriminates one way, the three sub-top cues
            (0.89, 0.88, 0.87) discriminate the other way, tail cues tie
            (design trials 3, 4; 12 obs/subject). In PWEI's steep-gamma
            regime the sub-top block outweighs the top cue, so PWEI
            chooses AGAINST the TTB winner.

    For each class compute p = P(choose the TTB winner). TTB's structural
    invariant is a single constant confidence p* on every discriminating

    into cells keyed by the inverted-polarity integrated evidence favoring
    that winner, E_w = sum_j w_j * (loser_j - winner_j), w_j proportional to
    validity. Then compute the OLS slope of P(choose the TTB winner) on E_w

    TTB: the winner's choice probability is the SAME constant p* on every
    discriminating trial (only the top discriminating cue is used), so the
    psychometric function over E_w is exactly flat -> slope = 0 for ANY
    (beta, epsilon).

    SPI: choice probability is a strictly increasing sigmoid of E_w
    (rho < 0.5 preserves monotonicity, lapse is affine), and the design's

    positive slope.

        E(gamma) = sum_j v_j**gamma * (b_j - a_j),
    and differ ONLY in the population supports of (gamma, log beta):
        RSD-vgp: gamma ~ U[0,2], log beta ~ U[ln1.8, ln6]
        GSP    : gamma ~ U[0,1.5], log beta ~ U[ln1.1, ln3.2]
    For every subject the exact binomial likelihood of their choices over the
    distinct trial types is integrated (grid) against each theory's prior; the
    attenuation A_eff gets a shared neutral prior (the two theories' A_eff
    ranges nearly coincide, so it must not drive the comparison). Subjects are
    independent, so on the pooled DataFrame the value is the sum of the
    per-subject log Bayes factors (the joint log BF of the whole dataset); on a
    single-subject slice it is that subject's individual log Bayes factor.
    Positive values favor RSD-vgp, negative values favor GSP.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.

  "theory": "Stochastic-Gate Anti-Endorsement Integration (SGAI). Subjects reading a product described by binary expert ratings treat an endorsement (rating = 1) as evidence AGAINST the option carrying it (a 'fewer red flags' reading), so the count-sparser option is perceived as higher quality. Within a trial, all cues are integrated additively with RAW (unnormalized) validity weights: the evidence for A over B is E = sum_j v_j^gamma_t (b_j - a_j), so the absolute endorsement-count margin sets the evidence scale independent of feature count, and identical vectors give exactly 50%. Choice follows p(A) = (1-eps)*[m*sigmoid(beta*E) + (1-m)*(1-sigmoid(beta*E))] + eps/2 with a graded per-trial inverted-polarity probability m and lapse eps. Three population/mechanism revisions distinguish SGAI from its predecessors: (i) TRIAL-LEVEL ATTENTION GATE — on each trial, with probability delta in [0.10, 0.25], the subject completely re-samples cue attention, drawing an effective per-trial exponent gamma_t uniformly over the full support [0, 2.2] (this re-draw includes the raw cue-counting endpoint gamma_t = 0 and the subject's habitual regime); this within-subject jitter flattens per-subject gamma identification, inflating tail-mass estimates without any genuine mass above gamma = 2.2; (ii) POPULATION PRIORS — gamma follows a mixture with support [0, 2.2] (58% uniform on [0, 1.2], 33% on [1.2, 2.0], and only a 9% sliver on (2.0, 2.2]), beta is log-uniform on [1.6, 6.0] (floor slightly BELOW the raw-evidence theory's 1.8), m in [0.76, 0.98] and epsilon in [0.03, 0.12], keeping mean effective attenuation A_eff near 0.67; (iii) LOW-PRECISION SUBPOPULATION — 13% of subjects carry beta log-uniform on [1.6, 2.0] and elevated lapse epsilon in [0.15, 0.25], absorbing the shallow-slope drift seen in low-precision subjects. Falsifiable signatures: per-subject psychometric functions with shallower mid-slope than their saturated asymptote implies, trial-to-trial inconsistency on repeated identical trials beyond binomial noise, and a positive-but-attenuated RSD-vs-EPAI log Bayes factor.",

  "rationale": "SGAI keeps the empirically confirmed core that made the raw-evidence family the running best (anti-endorsement reading, raw unnormalized v^gamma weights so the absolute count margin sets the evidence scale, graded polarity m, lapse eps) and surgically repairs the three diagnosed failures. (1) Tail-mass under-prediction (real ~0.298 vs 0.099-0.140 for the noise-free predecessors): instead of placing genuine mass above gamma = 2.2 (which the previous EPAI extension did, and which catastrophically flipped the RSD-vs-EPAI log Bayes factor to -31), SGAI introduces a TRIAL-LEVEL ATTENTION GATE: on delta in [0.10, 0.25] of trials the effective exponent is redrawn uniformly over the full support [0, 2.2], including the raw cue-counting endpoint. A subject whose gamma fluctuates trial-to-trial is mis-specified for any fixed-gamma measurement model, so the per-subject posterior over gamma flattens and its mass above 2.0 inflates — reproducing the elevated tail estimate without any true mass above 2.2, keeping the RSD-vs-EPAI Bayes factor mildly positive (~+3 to +7, observed +6.03) rather than strongly negative. (2) RSD-vs-GSP log Bayes factor over-prediction (96.7 vs observed 52.6) and the too-shallow tanh Bayes factor (-0.252 vs observed -0.414): a 13% low-precision subpopulation (beta log-uniform on [1.6, 2.0], elevated epsilon in [0.15, 0.25]) sits inside the GSP beta box but at/below the RSD floor, pulling both Bayes factors toward the GSP side exactly as the data demand, while the beta floor at 1.6 (below the RSD family's 1.8) admits lower-precision subjects generally. (3) The good fits on the remaining experiments are preserved because the per-trial likelihood core is unchanged: the population mean A_eff stays ~0.67 (m in [0.76, 0.98], eps in [0.03, 0.12]) matching the extremity anchors (Exps 7/8), the raw-weight scale keeps normalized slopes above threshold (Exps 9/10), and the sign structure of the contrast metrics (Exps 1-6) is invariant to the gamma jitter since the anti-endorsement preference for the sparser option holds for every gamma_t in [0, 2.2]. Each new degree of freedom is pinned by a currently-missed experiment (delta and the jitter width by the tail-mass experiment; the low-precision mixture weight by the two Bayes-factor experiments; the gamma sliver by the RSD-vs-EPAI contrast), giving SGAI falsifiable signatures — psychometric mid-slopes shallower than saturated asymptotes imply, and supra-binomial trial-to-trial inconsistency on repeated identical trials — that are distinct from both the hard-capped noise-free predecessor and the over-extended EPAI variant."
