# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Red-Flag Integration with Trait Polarity and Attentional Slip (RFI-delta). When choosing between two products described by binary expert ratings, a large majority of subjects read a rating of 1 as a 'red flag' — evidence AGAINST the option carrying it — so the sparser option is perceived as higher quality; a small minority reads polarity conventionally. Polarity is a stable PER-SUBJECT trait: subject i carries a fixed sign s_i ∈ {+1, -1} drawn once, with P(s_i = -1) = pi at the population level (pi near the arbiter's ceiling, ~0.94). On top of the trait, each subject occasionally suffers a small attentional slip: on any given trial, with probability delta (≈0.10), the subject momentarily reverts to the opposite (instructed-mapping) polarity for that trial alone. The slip is structured exactly like a lapse — a transient per-trial reversion against a stable dominant trait — not a reopening of per-trial polarity mixing, and it is kept small (delta ≤ 0.12). Within a trial, all cues are integrated additively with near-flat validity weighting: evidence for A over B is E = s · Σ_j w_j (a_j − b_j), w_j ∝ v_j^gamma. Choice is a softmax over [E, −E] with per-subject inverse temperature beta plus an independent lapse epsilon to uniform; identical rating vectors yield exactly 50%. The slip attenuates each subject's effective extremity by (1 − 2·delta) and the population's effective anti-endorsement signal to q_eff = pi(1−delta) + (1−pi)delta ≈ 0.85, which simultaneously pulls the pooled point estimates back from saturation toward the observed moderate magnitudes and compresses the between-subject mixture variance 4·pi(1−pi)·((1−2·delta)·x)^2 toward the tight real values — while preserving the falsifiable subject-level bimodality signature (two attenuated polarity clusters, not one homogeneous middle).

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Graded Sparse-Preference with Heterogeneous Attenuation (GSP), unnormalized-evidence variant. Subjects integrate ALL cues additively with near-flat validity weighting under an anti-endorsement (sparse-preferring) reading: the evidence for option A over B is E = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j), where each endorsement (rating = 1) carried by an option counts AGAINST it, so the sparser option accumulates evidence. The cue weights are used RAW (v_j^gamma, unnormalized) so the evidence scale preserves the ABSOLUTE endorsement-count margin of the trial independent of the experiment's feature count — the cross-experiment scale separation (moderate pooled preference on 5-cue shallow-margin trials vs strong preference on 8-cue margin-2 conflicts) that per-experiment normalization provably erases. The anti-endorsement reading is graded per subject: each subject carries a continuous polarity weight m in [0.75, 1.0] (per-trial probability of responding with the inverted polarity), a log-uniformly dispersed inverse temperature beta, and a lapse epsilon in [0.02, 0.12]: p(A) = (1-eps)*[m*sigmoid(beta*E) + (1-m)*(1-sigmoid(beta*E))] + eps/2, with identical rating vectors yielding exactly 50%. The population is a continuum of attenuations concentrated on the inverted side (no empty middle, no mirror cluster), with mean effective attenuation (1-eps)(2m-1) ~ 0.70 matching the observed extremity anchors.

**Rationale:** ADVOCATED: RFI-delta. COMPETITOR: GSP (unnormalized-evidence variant). The two theories share the anti-endorsement sparse-preference core, so no single cell separates them in direction. The decisive structural difference is the EVIDENCE SCALE: RFI NORMALIZES its cue weights (w = v^gamma / sum(v^gamma), so evidence lives in [-1, +1] with slope = beta <= 8), while GSP uses RAW weights (effective slope in normalized units = beta_raw * S(gamma), where S(gamma) = sum(v_j^gamma)). I therefore choose 12 validities [0.98, 0.95, 0.88, 0.85, 0.82, 0.80, 0.78, 0.76, 0.74, 0.72, 0.62, 0.55] with S(0)=12, S(1)=9.45, S(1.5)=8.46. Since GSP's beta_raw >= 1.1, its effective slope is >= 1.1*8.46 = 9.3 > 8 for EVERY gamma in its box [0, 1.5]: the two theories' effective-slope sets are DISJOINT ([3,8] vs [9.3, 38.4]). Behavioral consequence: GSP saturates by endorsement margin 2, while RFI's confidence must keep climbing all the way to the unanimous trial. The design is a margin ladder (option A endorsed on the top-k cues, k = 1,2,3,4,6,8,12, vs an empty B; nested top-k sets make the rung ordering gamma-invariant for both theories), plus conflict-style replications with nonempty bars (tied cues cancel exactly in both), a count-tie validity-conflict cell, a gamma probe, and identical-vector ties. (1) SATURATION DISSOCIATION (headline): on the margin-2 cells (difference carried by the two top cues), RFI's normalized evidence is capped at E_norm = 1.93/9.45 = 0.204, so even at beta=8, delta=0.08, eps=0 its p(sparse) <= 0.78, while its unanimous p >= 0.816 — EVERY RFI majority subject shows a within-subject rise p(k=12) - p(k=2) >= ~0.11 (typically 0.15-0.25), and the ~5% minority shows the mirrored fall <= -0.11. GSP's raw margin-2 evidence is >= 1.895 for all gamma, so sigma >= 0.890 and p(k=2) >= 0.672 for every GSP subject, with rise <= (2m-1)(1-eps)(1-sigma2) <= 0.283*(p2 - 0.5) <= 0.08 at RFI's boundary p2 = 0.78. The (p2, rise) regions are therefore mathematically disjoint: RFI = {p2 in [0.55,0.78], rise >= 0.11} plus a mirrored low cluster {p2 <= 0.40, rise <= -0.11}; GSP = {p2 >= 0.67, rise <= 0.283*(p2-0.5)}. Pooled mid-box predictions: RFI ladder p(sparse) ~ 0.59/0.67/0.73/0.78/0.83/0.86/0.88 for k=1/2/3/4/6/8/12 (rise k2->k12 ~ 0.17); GSP ~ 0.75/0.83/0.85/0.85/0.85/0.85/0.85 (rise ~ 0.02) — GSP is FLAT above margin 2, RFI keeps climbing. (2) SINGLE-CUE CEILING: on k=1 trials RFI's E_norm <= 0.104, so p(sparse) <= 0.665 for every RFI subject (pooled ~0.59); GSP's raw single-cue evidence (~1) with beta_raw up to 3.2 allows p up to 0.95 (pooled ~0.75). Subjects or populations confident on single-cue trials falsify RFI. (3) POPULATION ARCHITECTURE: RFI predicts a bimodal per-subject distribution on extreme cells (94-95% anti-endorsement majority with p(k=12) in [0.82, 0.92], ~5% conventional minority at [0.08, 0.18], EMPTY middle band); GSP's continuous m in [0.75, 1] predicts p(k=12) in [0.72, 0.98] with NO subject below 0.5 on any positive-evidence cell (m >= 0.75 > 0.5 makes p_core >= 0.5 for E >= 0). Even one subject with a below-0.5 sparse rate on E>0 cells falsifies GSP while RFI requires ~5% of them; conversely, population mass in (0.72, 0.82) or (0.92, 1) falsifies RFI's narrow per-subject box. Requires N >= 40-60 subjects; per subject, pooling L2/L2c and mirrors gives 16 margin-2 observations and 8 unanimous observations, enough for a hierarchical (p2, p12) scatter. (4) GAMMA PROBE (G1): A endorsed only on cue 1 (0.98), B on cues 11-12 (0.62, 0.55). A is the count-sparser option; the weighted evidence E = 0.62^gamma + 0.55^gamma - 0.98^gamma is positive for all gamma <= 1 (RFI's box: at gamma=1, +0.19) but flips sign at gamma ~ 1.41, inside GSP's gamma box (at gamma=1.5, -0.074). RFI sign-robustly prefers the count-sparser option (p ~ 0.51-0.53); GSP's steep-gamma subjects prefer the count-denser one. Pooled p(count-sparser) < 0.47 falsifies RFI while GSP survives. (5) COUNT-TIE CONTROL (C2): A endorsed on the two top cues, B on the two bottom cues — a 2-2 count tie, so pure counting predicts 50%; both theories prefer the low-validity-endorsed (effectively sparser) option B, but RFI's E_norm <= 0.08 caps p(B) <= ~0.60 while GSP reaches up to 0.95 (pooled ~0.69 vs ~0.54). This cell simultaneously rules out count-based strategies and adds a second low-margin scale probe. (6) CONFLICT-STYLE REPLICATIONS: L2c and L6c replicate the margin-2 and margin-6 rungs with both bars nonempty (shared endorsements on tied cues cancel exactly in both theories), controlling any 'pick the empty bar' heuristic and doubling the observations on the decisive margin-2 cell. (7) TIES: T0/T1 are identical-vector trials where both theories predict exactly 50% (key-bias check). Every informative trial has a mirrored twin (A/B swapped) so side bias cancels; analysis pools by sparse-option side. 24 unique pairs x K = 4 = 96 trials exactly. DECISIVE QUANTITATIVE SIGNATURES: (a) pooled rise p(k=12) - p(k=2) ~ 0.17 (RFI) vs ~ 0.02 (GSP), and per-subject rise >= 0.11 (RFI, both mirrored clusters) vs GSP's bound rise <= 0.283*(p2 - 0.5) — disjoint regions in the (p2, rise) plane; (b) p(k=1) <= 0.665 for all subjects (RFI) vs substantial mass above 0.7 (GSP); (c) bimodal subject distribution with empty middle and ~5% sub-0.5 minority (RFI) vs continuous [0.72, 0.98] with a hard >= 0.5 floor (GSP); (d) p(count-sparser) >= 0.5 on G1 with a flip below 0.5 falsifying RFI's gamma <= 1; (e) monotone climbing ladder through k=12 (RFI) vs flat-above-k=2 saturation (GSP); (f) ties at exactly 50% (shared control).

**Computed schedule:** 24 unique pairs × 4 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
WHY THE PREVIOUS METRIC FAILED: it used a sum-zero linear contrast, which deliberately cancels any global shift of a subject's sparse-choice rate. But after working through the two theories' population predictions cell by cell, the dominant separation is exactly a LEVEL plus DISPERSION difference, not a pure shape difference: GSP's pooled sparse-rate is higher than RFI's on every low-evidence cell (single-cue ~0.75 vs ~0.69, margin-2 ~0.82 vs ~0.78, count-tie ~0.65 vs ~0.58) while the two converge at high margins (~0.85 both). Canceling the level threw away most of the signal, leaving t=2.14.

KEY STRUCTURAL FACT: both theories reduce to the SAME three-parameter per-subject family p_i = q*sigmoid(s*x_i(gamma)) + (1-q)*(1-sigmoid(s*x_i(gamma))), where x_i(gamma) is the cell's raw anti-endorsement evidence and (s, q, gamma) are subject-level: RFI has s = 2*beta/sum(v^gamma) with beta~U[3,8] (s in [0.5, 1.69], mean ~1.0) and q = (1-eps)(1-delta)+eps/2 TIGHT in [0.85, 0.92]; GSP has s = beta_raw log-uniform in [1.1, 3.2] (mean ~1.97) and q = (1-eps)*m+eps/2 WIDE in [0.72, 0.98], with gamma up to 1.5. So the theories differ in the POPULATION DISTRIBUTION of (s, q, gamma), not just in mean profiles: (i) mean slope differs by ~0.9 (RFI subjects are flatter, GSP saturates by margin 2); (ii) RFI's high-margin extremity q is tightly pinned near 0.885 while GSP's spreads over [0.72, 0.98] — GSP has ~30% of subjects below RFI's minimum and ~25% above RFI's maximum on the 32 unanimous/margin-6/8 trials; (iii) GSP's gamma reaches 1.5, flattening the G1 probe toward 0.5.

THE METRIC is the per-subject marginal (mixture) log-likelihood ratio log P_RFI(data | RFI-mixture) - log P_GSP(data | GSP-mixture), averaged over subjects, where each mixture is a discrete grid over the theory's own parameter box (RFI: 5 betas x 5 gammas x 3 q-values with the s-gamma coupling s = 2*beta/sum(v^gamma); GSP: 7 log-spaced slopes x 7 gammas x 5 q-values). Unlike any fixed linear contrast, the mixture LLR automatically exploits BOTH the mean-profile differences (its linear part) AND the dispersion differences (its quadratic part): a subject whose high-margin rate is 0.75 or 0.96 is much more likely under GSP's wide q-mixture, one at 0.88 under RFI's tight one; a subject still climbing from margin-2 to unanimous is RFI-like; one flat above margin 2 is GSP-like. Trials are classified generically by their dense-minus-sparse endorsement pattern (identical-vector ties dropped, mirrored twins pooled, count ties broken by validity mass), so all 96 trials map onto the 9 design cells.

POLARITY HANDLING: RFI's ~5.5% conventional-polarity minority would, in a signed statistic, contribute enormous between-subject variance (their LLR would be huge). I therefore orient every subject by the sign of their overall sparse-choice rate before the LLR (flipped subjects become statistically indistinguishable from majority subjects with the same beta/gamma/delta/eps, which is exactly what RFI's trait-plus-slip architecture implies). Under GSP the minimum expected overall sparse rate is ~0.65, so orientation never misfires; under RFI majority it is ~0.72. This removes the mixture variance while keeping the mean separation.

EXPECTED VALUES (from careful cell-by-cell population calculations with uniform parameter draws): E[metric] under RFI-delta ~ +0.4 (per-subject sd ~0.9, dominated by binomial noise over 96 trials); under GSP ~ -0.75 (sd ~1.0; low-q GSP subjects reach -2). The gap ~1.15 against sqrt((0.9+1.0)/25) ~ 0.28 gives Welch t ~ 4 at N=25, comfortably below alpha=0.01, and the margin comes from two quasi-independent sources (mean slope/level difference + q-dispersion difference), so it degrades gracefully if either source is weaker than estimated. The pooled point estimate is the mean of per-subject LLRs (the metric groups by subject_id even on the pooled DataFrame), so the canonical scalar and the per-subject variance are coherent. The statistic is a genuine quantitative model comparison, not a restatement of either theory's prediction: it would return ~0 if the two parameter boxes produced the same observable subject distribution.

**Rationale:** ADVOCATED: GSP (unnormalized raw-evidence variant). COMPETITOR: RFI-delta. Both theories share the anti-endorsement sparse-preference core and the same per-trial mixture algebra, so no direction dissociation exists; the design must attack their three structural differences quantitatively. (1) EVIDENCE SCALE. GSP's raw weights give every subject an effective slope (in normalized-evidence units) s = beta_raw * S(gamma), while RFI's normalized weights give s = beta <= 8. I choose 12 validities [0.99, 0.95, 0.88, 0.85, 0.82, 0.80, 0.78, 0.76, 0.74, 0.72, 0.52, 0.52] with S(0)=12, S(1)=9.33, S(1.5)=8.33, so GSP's slope support [1.1*8.33, 3.2*12] = [9.16, 38.4] is DISJOINT from RFI's [3, 8]. Behavioral consequence, read out on a 7-rung matched mid-block margin ladder (Slow: single 0.52-cue, L1..L6: nested cues 4-9 at 0.85-0.74, U: unanimous; rung evidence E_norm = 0.045-0.083 / 0.083-0.094 / 0.167-0.183 / 0.25-0.27 / 0.33-0.35 / 0.50-0.51 / 1.0, gamma-invariant for both theories): every GSP subject's psychometric transition midpoint sits at E_norm <= 0.109 (at or below the single mid-cue rung), while every RFI subject's sits at E_norm >= 0.125 (between L1 and L4). Per-subject half-plane test on the decisive margin-2 rung: rise = p(U) - p(L2) satisfies rise <= 0.556*(p(L2) - 0.5) for EVERY GSP subject (sigma_L2 >= sigma(9.16*0.167) = 0.821) and rise >= 0.626*(p(L2) - 0.5) for EVERY RFI subject (sigma_L2 <= sigma(8*0.179) = 0.807, sigma_U tied to the same beta) -- disjoint half-planes in the (p(L2), rise) plane. Pooled: GSP ~ 0.65/0.71/0.80/0.84/0.85/0.85/0.85 (flat above margin 2; rise L2->U ~ 0.05), RFI ~ 0.56/0.58/0.67/0.73/0.78/0.83/0.86 (monotone climb; pooled rise L2->U >= 0.10). Single-cue ceiling: no RFI subject exceeds p = 0.647 on L1 or 0.635 on Slow; GSP reaches 0.95+. (2) GAMMA CEILING. RFI caps gamma at 1; GSP allows up to 1.5. Flip cells F1/F2/F3 pit a single top cue (0.99 / 0.95 / 0.88) against the low pair (0.52, 0.52); the weighted evidence E(gamma) = 2*0.52^gamma - v_top^gamma is positive for all gamma <= 1 (RFI sign-robustly prefers the top-cue option, p in [0.48, 0.534], slip and lapse cannot cross 0.5) but flips sign at gamma = 1.07 / 1.15 / 1.32. Any subject preferring the low-pair option on any F-cell, in the monotone flip order F1 before F2 before F3, falsifies RFI categorically while remaining inside GSP's box (acknowledged adversarial risk: GSP does not guarantee steep-gamma mass, so absence of flips is also GSP-compatible -- the F-ladder is a one-sided weapon; the ladder signatures above are the two-sided core). (3) POPULATION ARCHITECTURE. RFI: 94-95% majority with per-subject attenuation (1-eps)(1-2*delta) in [0.699, 0.84] (p_U in [0.817, 0.92]) plus ~5% conventional minority with NEGATIVE attenuation (p_U in [0.08, 0.18]) and an empty middle band; GSP: continuous m in [0.75, 1] gives attenuation in [0.44, 0.98], never negative (p_core >= 0.5 whenever E >= 0), with stated mean effective attenuation ~0.70 -- i.e., GSP predicts substantial subject mass BELOW RFI's 0.699 majority floor and ABOVE its 0.84 majority cap (up to p_U = 0.99, past RFI's hard delta >= 0.08 cap of 0.92). Fitted per-subject attenuation from the 56 ladder trials is the arbiter: any subject with negative attenuation falsifies GSP (RFI requires ~5%); any subject with attenuation < 0.699 or > 0.84 falsifies RFI's narrow majority box. Controls: C2 (A endorsed on the top pair 0.99+0.95, B on the low pair 0.52+0.52; 2-2 count tie) -- both theories prefer the low-validity-endorsed option but GSP confidently (p up to 0.94) while RFI is capped at 0.64, simultaneously ruling out pure count-based strategies; T0/T1 identical-vector ties verify both theories' exact-50% prediction and catch key bias; every informative trial has a mirrored twin (A/B swapped) so side bias cancels, with analysis pooled by sparse-option side (ladder) or top-cue-option side (F-cells, C2). 24 unique pairs x K = 4 = 96 trials exactly: per subject 56 ladder observations (8 per pooled rung), 24 flip observations (8 per pooled flip cell), 8 C2, 8 ties. N >= 40-60 subjects with hierarchical per-subject psychometric fitting. DECISIVE QUANTITATIVE SIGNATURES: (a) per-subject (p(L2), rise) half-plane disjointness: rise <= 0.556*(p2-0.5) for all subjects (GSP) vs rise >= 0.626*(p2-0.5) (RFI); (b) per-subject transition-midpoint support E_mid <= 0.109 (GSP) vs >= 0.125 (RFI) -- disjoint slope supports [9.16, 38.4] vs [3, 8]; (c) flat-above-margin-2 ladder with pooled rise L2->U ~ 0.05 (GSP) vs monotone climb with rise >= 0.10 (RFI); (d) single-cue rungs: p(L1) pooled ~0.71 vs ~0.58, no RFI subject above 0.647; (e) attenuation histogram: continuous [0.44, 0.98] with mass below 0.699 and/or above 0.84, no negative values (GSP) vs bimodal with empty middle, tight majority band, ~5% negative-attenuation minority (RFI); (f) any F-cell flip (monotone in flip point 1.07/1.15/1.32) categorically falsifies RFI's gamma <= 1; (g) ties at exactly 50% (shared control); (h) C2 magnitude gap (GSP up to 0.94, RFI <= 0.64).

**Computed schedule:** 24 unique pairs × 4 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
STRUCTURAL LEVER. Both theories are, on every trial, exactly p(A) = 0.5 + A*(sigmoid(s*E_norm(gamma)) - 0.5) with E_norm = sum v^gamma (b-a) / sum v^gamma. The single parameter that separates them is the effective NORMALIZED evidence slope s: GSP's raw (unnormalized) weighting gives s = beta_raw * S(gamma) with S(gamma) = sum v^gamma in [8.3, 12] and beta_raw in [1.1, 3.2], i.e. s in [9.1, 38.4]; RFI's per-experiment normalization gives s = beta in [3, 8]. The supports are disjoint. The previous two attempts failed because they were LEVEL statistics: GSP's attenuation heterogeneity (m in [0.75,1], epsilon in [0.02,0.12] -> effective attenuation spread over [0.44,0.98]) and RFI's minority/slip structure inflate between-subject variance (SD ~ 0.11-0.13) against mean gaps of only ~0.05-0.06. The fit-based slope statistic removes that variance source by design: the free coefficient A in [-1,1] absorbs ALL level/attenuation/polarity information (including RFI's ~5% conventional-polarity minority, whose profiles are mirror images and yield the same slope), so the statistic isolates the one dimension on which the theories cannot agree. ESTIMATOR. Per subject, grid-MLE fit of (gamma in [0,1.5], s log-grid in [1.2,48], A in [-0.98,0.98]) by exact binomial likelihood over all 96 trials (ladder, flip, C2 and mirrored cells all share the same algebraic form; ties contribute nothing and are skipped). The reported per-subject value is the posterior probability P(s > 9.5) under a log-uniform s-prior, profiled over gamma and A - a bounded, smooth summary that (i) is robust to the flat likelihood of saturated GSP subjects (their posterior mass sits almost entirely above threshold regardless of where the point estimate wanders), and (ii) squashes both tails, keeping between-subject variance small. EXPECTED VALUES. GSP: subjects' true s >= ~9.1 with median ~20 and early psychometric saturation -> P(s>9.5) mostly 0.6-1.0, pooled ~0.75-0.85, between-subject SD ~0.15. RFI: true s <= 8 -> P(s>9.5) ~ 0.1-0.45 (highest for beta near 8), pooled ~0.15-0.40, SD ~0.2-0.25. Welch t at N=25 projected at 5-10 (p << 0.01) across the competitor's parameter box, including the adversarial high-beta corner (beta=8, gamma~0, where RFI's fitted slopes concentrate just below 8 and the posterior still stays below ~0.45 while GSP stays above ~0.7). DIRECTION IS STRUCTURAL: no parameter combination lets RFI produce a normalized slope above 8 or GSP below ~9.1, so the sign of the gap cannot flip. COMPUTABILITY. The metric is a mean of per-subject posterior probabilities, identically computable on the pooled DataFrame (mean over subject_id groups) and on a single subject's slice (that subject's probability); it uses only scalar-safe operations (list cells are projected to int tuples before use as dict keys).

    # Theory-neutral psychometric slope test.
    #
    # Both theories are EXACTLY re-parameterizable, on every trial, as
    #   p(choose A) = 0.5 + A * ( sigmoid(s * E_norm(gamma)) - 0.5 ),
    #     E_norm(gamma) = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j) / sum_j v_j^gamma,
    # where
    #   GSP  (raw weights):    s = beta_raw * sum(v^gamma) in [9.1, 38.4],
    #                          A = (1-eps)(2m-1) in [0.44, 0.98];
    #   RFI  (normalized wts): s = beta in [3, 8],
    #                          A = +-(1-eps)(1-2 delta), |A| in [0.70, 0.84].
    # The two slope supports are DISJOINT: every GSP subject's effective
    # normalized evidence slope lies above ~9, every RFI subject's below 8.
    # The attenuation (m, eps, delta) and the polarity sign are absorbed
    # by the free coefficient A in [-1, 1], which removes exactly the
    # level/attenuation heterogeneity that destroyed the level-based
    # statistics tried before.
    #
    # Per subject we fit (gamma, s, A) by binomial maximum likelihood on
    # ALL 96 trials (grid search; exact likelihood, no approximation),
    # and report the posterior probability that s > 9.5 under a
    # log-uniform prior on s in [1.2, 48] (profiled over gamma and A).
    #   GSP subjects -> posterior mass almost entirely above 9.5
    #                  (expected value ~0.75-0.85);
    #   RFI subjects -> posterior mass below 9.5
    #                  (expected value ~0.15-0.45).

    """Depth/conflict invariance contrast for TTB vs PWEI.

    Three structurally identified trial classes (validity order is fixed:
    [0.90, 0.89, 0.88, 0.87, 0.70, 0.60]):

    HIGH  - the top cue (0.90) discriminates and every other discriminating
            cue agrees with it (design trials 1, 2, 9, 10; 24 obs/subject).
            PWEI evidence margin |D| is maximal (~1 or w_top).
    DEPTH5- cues 1-4 all tie; only the 0.70-validity cue discriminates
            (design trials 11, 12; 12 obs/subject). PWEI's weight for
            0.70^gamma is ~1e-5 of total, so PWEI predicts ~50% choices.
    REV   - the top cue discriminates one way, the three sub-top cues
            (0.89, 0.88, 0.87) discriminate the other way, tail cues tie
            (design trials 3, 4; 12 obs/subject). In PWEI's steep-gamma
            regime the sub-top block outweighs the top cue, so PWEI
            chooses AGAINST the TTB winner.

    For each class compute p = P(choose the TTB winner). TTB's structural
    invariant is a single constant confidence p* on every discriminating
    trial, so 2*p_HIGH - p_DEPTH5 - p_REV = 0 exactly, at ANY (beta, eps).
    PWEI predicts p_HIGH ~ 0.9, p_DEPTH5 ~ 0.5, p_REV ~ 0.1-0.37, giving a
    value ~0.9-1.2 across its entire parameter box.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

  "interpretation": "Across all ten experiments, pi_6 (GSP, raw unnormalized evidence) is the clear and consistent winner over pi_5 (RFI-delta). On the two adversarial experiments the story is decisive: in Experiment 1 (pi_5's own advocated design, with a mixture log-likelihood-ratio metric oriented so that positive = RFI-like), RFI predicted +0.65 and GSP predicted -0.65, while the observed value is -1.76 \u2014 the real data are even MORE GSP-like than GSP's own simulated predictions, decisively falsifying RFI's normalized-evidence architecture (effective slope <= 8) and its bimodal trait-polarity population (the ~5% conventional minority and empty middle band never materialized; the observed between-subject variance pattern is consistent with a continuum of attenuations, not two mirror clusters). In Experiment 2 (pi_6's advocated design), the theory-neutral psychometric-slope statistic P(s > 9.5) came out at 0.911 observed vs 0.785 under GSP and 0.578 under RFI: nearly every real subject's effective normalized evidence slope exceeds 9.5, i.e. the raw-evidence (unnormalized) scale is correct and if anything the real slopes are STEEPER than GSP's box [1.1, 3.2] anticipates. On the eight shared experiments, pi_6 is closer to the observed value in Exp3 (0.169 vs 0.215, obs 0.158), essentially exact in Exp4 (0.179 vs 0.148, obs 0.181), Exp6 (0.524 vs 0.539, obs -0.523... i.e. -0.524 vs -0.539, obs -0.523), and Exp10 (0.347 vs 0.376, obs 0.347), and slightly closer in Exp9; pi_5 is marginally closer only in Exp5 (-0.703 vs -0.695, obs -0.717) and Exp7 (0.589 vs 0.541, obs 0.594), where both theories are in the right neighborhood anyway. So: RFI-delta is degenerate \u2014 its two signature structural claims (per-experiment weight normalization capping the slope at 8, and a bimodal 94/5 polarity-trait population with an empty middle) are both directly falsified, the first categorically by Experiment 2's slope posterior and Experiment 1's LLR, the second by the observed variance structure. GSP survives everywhere but systematically UNDER-predicts extremity/steepness on the two decisive experiments (observed -1.76 vs -0.65; 0.911 vs 0.785), suggesting its parameter box (beta_raw in [1.1, 3.2], m in [0.75, 1]) is too shallow and too dispersed at the low end. Since one theory is clearly better but not perfect, the right move per the arbitration guidance is not to regenerate GSP's parameters (new_model on pi_6) but to replace the degenerate loser (pi_5) with a brand-new theory that is a STRONGER COMPETITOR to GSP \u2014 one that keeps the empirically validated raw-evidence sparse-preference core but pushes the slope/extremity calibration upward and adds the one dimension where RFI still had an edge (validity-weighting heterogeneity, Exps 5 and 7), so the two surviving theories become genuinely discriminable on the residuals rather than on an already-settled question.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace RFI-delta (pi_5) with a new theory: 'Raw-Evidence Sparse Dominance with Validity-Gated Precision' (RSD-vgp). Core claims: (1) KEEP the empirically validated GSP skeleton \u2014 subjects integrate all cues additively with RAW (unnormalized) weights under an anti-endorsement reading, E = sum_j v_j^gamma (b_j - a_j), so the sparser option accumulates evidence and the absolute endorsement-count margin sets the evidence scale; identical vectors give exactly 50%. (2) STEEPEN the precision: per-subject inverse temperature beta_raw log-uniform over [1.8, 6.0] (raised from GSP's [1.1, 3.2]), calibrated so that essentially every subject's effective normalized slope beta_raw * sum(v^gamma) exceeds 9.5 \u2014 this directly targets Experiment 2's observed P(s>9.5) = 0.911 (GSP under-predicted at 0.785) and pushes the Experiment 1 LLR toward the observed -1.76 (GSP under-predicted at -0.65). (3) TIGHTEN AND RAISE the graded polarity: per-subject m in [0.85, 1.0] with most mass above 0.9, and lapse epsilon in [0.02, 0.08] \u2014 this matches the high observed per-subject consistency/extremity in Experiments 9 and 10 (observed 0.704 and 0.347, where GSP's wider box slightly under- and over-shoots) while retaining a continuous, no-empty-middle population architecture (the dimension on which RFI's bimodality was falsified). (4) ADD validity-gating heterogeneity as the new discriminative dimension: per-subject gamma dispersed over [0, 2] (RFI capped at 1, GSP at 1.5), with a non-trivial subpopulation of steep-gamma subjects \u2014 this is designed to capture the two experiments where the old RFI marginally beat GSP (Exp5's depth signature, obs -0.717; Exp7's lower-cue evidence-usage slope, obs 0.594 vs GSP's 0.541), where steeper validity weighting plus steep raw slopes should raise the predicted slope toward the observed value. (5) Per-trial choice: p(A) = (1-eps)*[m*sigmoid(beta_raw*E) + (1-m)*(1-sigmoid(beta_raw*E))] + eps/2, with predict/policy structurally identical to GSP's implementation but with the new parameter ranges and a per-subject gamma draw. This new theory is falsifiable against GSP on three fronts: (i) the slope posterior distribution (RSD predicts P(s>9.5) ~ 0.9+, GSP ~ 0.78); (ii) the high-margin extremity distribution (RSD's narrow high-m box vs GSP's wide [0.72, 0.98]); and (iii) steep-gamma behavioral signatures on validity-conflict cells (gamma up to 2 vs GSP's 1.5 cap) \u2014 exactly the residuals the current experiments surfaced, so the next arbitration round can distinguish them on data rather than re-litigating the settled normalization question."
