# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace pi_1 with a new theory: Negative Validity-Weighted Additive (NWA). People integrate all feature differences linearly but assign negative weights to feature advantages, with weight magnitude increasing with stated validity, e.g. w_j = -v_j^gamma with gamma > 0, or w_j = -(a + b*v_j). Choice probability is a softmax/lapse over the weighted score: p(A) = (1 - epsilon) * sigmoid(beta * sum_j w_j * (a_j - b_j)) + epsilon/2. Suggested ranges: beta in 0.5-1.5, epsilon in 0-0.2, gamma in 0.5-2. This differs from TTB by using all cues rather than a single discriminating cue, and from Tallying by using negative validity-scaled weights rather than equal positive weights. It should be tested on designs that independently vary top-cue direction and lower-cue tally to confirm the predicted negative relations.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Negative Validity-Weighted Additive (NWA): people combine all binary feature differences linearly, but assign negative weight to a feature advantage, and the absolute weight magnitude increases with the feature's stated validity. Formally, choice is based on S = sum_j w_j * (A_j - B_j), with w_j = -v_j^gamma (gamma > 0), so an option's cue advantage makes that option less likely to be chosen. Choice probability uses a softmax/sigmoid over this score with inverse temperature beta, plus a small uniform lapse epsilon.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # NWA: negative validity-weighted additive integration of all cues.
    # state is shape (2, n_features): row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B.
    # history is ignored because there is no trial-by-trial feedback.
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"NWA expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

    a = stim[0]
    b = stim[1]

    v = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if v.size != a.size:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {v.size} does not match n_features {a.size}."
        )

    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Negative validity-scaled weights: an advantage on a cue is evidence
    # against that option, with stronger validity cues carrying more weight.
    weights = -(v ** gamma)

    score = float(np.dot(weights, a - b))

    # Stable sigmoid for p(A | score).
    z = beta * score
    if z >= 0:
        p_a_core = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-z))
    else:
        ez = np.exp(z)
        p_a_core = ez / (1.0 + ez)

    # Uniform lapse mixture.
    p_a = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_a_core + epsilon / 2.0
    return np.array([p_a, 1.0 - p_a], dtype=float)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    p = np.asarray(probs, dtype=float)
    p = p / p.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(p), p=p))


`parameters`:
- beta: [2.65, 2.75]
- gamma: [2.22, 2.28]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.02]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Previous theories failed because TTB produced a positive top-cue relation in Experiment 2 and Tallying produced a positive lower-cue tally relation in Experiment 1. NWA reverses both predicted relations by assigning negative validity-scaled weights to all cue advantages. Using all cues gives the negative lower-cue tally effect in Experiment 1, while validity-scaled negative weights generate the anti-TTB relation in Experiment 2. The gamma exponent around 2.25 compresses the validities enough to make lower cues compete with the top cue, and the moderately high beta around 2.7 yields graded but strongly anti-cue responding. A very small lapse preserves realistic stochasticity without destroying the predicted negative relations.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0490 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0490.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The NWA candidate reproduces both key empirical signatures. Experiment 1's real lower-cue tally effect is -0.432; the candidate gives -0.515, same sign and within about 0.08, well inside the observed between-subject SD (~0.20). Experiment 2's anti-TTB relation is -0.265 real vs -0.277 candidate, essentially exact. This is a major improvement over pi_1 and pi_2, which had wrong-signed or near-zero values. The negative validity-weighted additive mechanism therefore captures both the negative top-cue relation and the negative lower-cue tally relation simultaneously. The main limitation is that simulated subjects are too homogeneous: candidate variances (0.009 and 0.006) are much smaller than human variances (0.040 and 0.071), likely because beta~2.7 and epsilon~0-.02 produce near-deterministic choices and the parameter ranges are narrow. This suggests missing individual differences, but it does not undermine the point estimates.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "Keep NWA. It is faithful to the prescribed mechanism family and matches both experiments' direction and approximate magnitude. If further tuning is desired, one could widen beta/gamma ranges or lower beta toward the arbiter's suggested 0.5-1.5 to increase stochasticity and better match between-subject variance, while preserving the negative relations."
