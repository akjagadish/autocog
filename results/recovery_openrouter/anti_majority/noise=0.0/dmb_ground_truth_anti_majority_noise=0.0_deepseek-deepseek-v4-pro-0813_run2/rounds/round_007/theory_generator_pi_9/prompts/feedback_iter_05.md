# feedback_iter_05

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_8`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_8`).

Replace pi_8 with a thresholded validity-weighted anti-validity theory with tally fallback in the dead zone. Core proposal: each subject computes D_i = sum_j v_j^{gamma_i} * (A_j - B_j) with a subject-level validity exponent gamma_i (wide distribution around 2). If |D_i| < theta_i, the validity signal is treated as ambiguous and choice is driven by an unweighted tally term T = sum_j (A_j - B_j) with subject-level weight omega_i (allow both signs); if |D_i| >= theta_i, choice follows a mostly negative anti-validity sign through a moderately saturating transform S_i = sign_i * lambda_i * D_i / (tau_i + |D_i|) + bias_i. Choice probability is p(A) = lapse/2 + (1-lapse) * sigmoid(beta_i * S_i). There is no conflict-gain interaction and no global tally term outside the dead zone. Suggested parameter ranges: gamma_i wide enough to generate heterogeneity (e.g., 1.0-3.0 or a mixture), theta_i around 0.10-0.20, tau_i moderate (0.5-2.0) rather than pi_5's tiny tau, beta_i moderate-high, and omega_i large enough that beta*omega on the tally sum gives logit variance of roughly 3-4 in Experiment 2. This theory should match Experiment 1 because all D values are far above theta, so concentrated and diffuse pairs with equal D give equal choice probabilities. It should match Experiment 2 because D=0 falls in the dead zone and the tally fallback creates strong row-wise dispersion. It should fix Experiment 14 because small |D| values below theta produce almost no validity-driven step, while larger orienting values still drive anti-validity contrasts. This differs from pi_5 by adding the dead-zone tally fallback and relaxing the small-tau saturation, and differs from pi_8 by removing conflict modulation and making the tally term conditional on ambiguity rather than global.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Thresholded validity-weighted anti-validity with a zero-tally dead-zone repair and fragmented-evidence dilution. Each subject forms D = sum_j v_j^{gamma_i} (A_j - B_j). When |D| is below a subject-level ambiguity threshold theta_i, the validity signal is treated as ambiguous. If the unweighted tally is nonzero, choice is driven by that tally through omega_i with a single strong weight, exactly as in the accepted base. If the tally is exactly zero, choice remains graded via a small signed validity-derived anti-validity term psi_i * sign_i * D / (kappa_i + |D|), but this term is now diluted multiplicatively by exp(-rho_disc_i * max(0, n_disc - 2)), where n_disc is the number of discriminating features. This dilution suppresses responding for zero-tally rows with many simultaneously disagreeing features while leaving zero-tally rows with only two discriminating features untouched. When |D| >= theta_i, choice follows the mostly negative anti-validity transform sign_i * lambda_i * D / (tau_i + |D|) + bias_i. Choice probability is p(A) = lapse_i/2 + (1-lapse_i) * sigmoid(beta_i * S_i).

`rationale`:
This edit follows the most recent critic feedback exactly. The accepted iter-2 base already solved E16, E13, E14, E9, E4 and E15 with its single strong nonzero-tally fallback and its zero-tally graded term. Every subsequent rejected edit failed because it modified the nonzero-tally arm and destroyed E16 and E13. Here I keep the base's tally arm and every other parameter untouched, and I add only a multiplicative dilution factor to the zero-tally branch: score = psi * sign * D / (kappa_dead + |D|) * exp(-rho_disc * max(0, n_disc - 2)), active only for |D| < theta and T = 0. The dilution is designed to fix the base's one dominant residual, E12, where many zero-tally rows contain four or eight discriminating features and the base was far too decisive (0.616 vs human 0.036). With rho_disc around 0.9-1.4, those high-n_disc zero-tally rows are pushed back toward chance, while n_disc=2 rows (E13 and E14) are completely unaffected because the exponent is zero. E16's rows all have nonzero T and therefore never enter the zero-tally branch, so its row-logit variance remains 3.597. No other parameter is changed, preserving the base's successes on E1, E2, E4, E9, E10, E13, E14 and E15. This is the minimal, targeted repair the gate should accept if E12 falls to roughly 0.03-0.06 without collateral damage.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2516 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2040 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.2054 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.2060 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.2230 -> REJECTED
- iter 6 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1717 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 6 at loss=0.1717.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed thresholded validity-weighted anti-validity architecture with a dead-zone tally fallback, and it is clearly competitive on several experiments: E2 is close (-0.225 vs -0.265), E5/E6/E7 magnitudes are small, and E10/E11/E15 are near their real values. However, the candidate fails the experiments this architecture was explicitly designed to explain. The most decisive failure is E14: simulated 0.020 vs human 0.389. In E14 every pair has an unweighted tally of zero (one positive feature on each side), so whenever |D| falls under theta the model scores T=0 and emits p(A)=0.5. The low-|D| band (0.015-0.15) is almost entirely inside the dead zone, erasing the graded anti-validity contrast that real subjects show. The same zero-tally collapse explains E13 (-0.182 vs -0.513), where low-|D| single-cue pairs are forced to chance. E16 is also underdispersed (1.495 vs 3.695 row-logit variance): the tally fallback is either not active on enough rows or beta*omega is too weak to generate the observed spread. Secondary miscalibrations include E8/E12 being too contrastive (0.284 vs 0.120; 0.121 vs 0.036), indicating a hard-threshold artifact, while large-D anti-validity effects are too weak in E1/E4/E9/E13.
Rationale: Keep the same mechanism family but repair the dead zone. (a) Eliminate the zero-tally collapse: for |D|<theta and T=0, do not force p(A)=0.5; allow a small signed validity-derived term (e.g., score = omega*T + psi*sign(D)*|D|/(kappa+|D|), with psi subject-level and mostly anti-validity-signed) or lower theta below the informative low-|D| band. This should restore the E14/E13 graded low-D response. (b) Strengthen the E16 tally arm: increase omega_mag and/or beta so beta*omega averages near 1.2-1.5, reduce lapse, and verify the four E16 rows actually enter the tally branch; target row-logit variance near 3.7 rather than 1.5. (c) Rebalance the anti-validity transform to recover large-D contrasts in E1/E4/E9/E13 (larger lam/beta or smaller tau) while softening the hard threshold around theta so E8/E12 do not over-contrast.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2516 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2040 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a strong improvement in exactly the places my last critique targeted: E14 went from 0.020 to 0.381 (human 0.389), E13 from -0.182 to -0.500 (human -0.513), and E16 from 1.495 to 3.597 (human 3.695). E4, E8, E9 and E15 are also now close. But the repair was over-decisive. The largest failures are E12 (0.616 vs human 0.036), E3 (0.793 vs 0.362), and E11 (0.637 vs 0.303), with E6 and E7 also showing too much ordered responding (0.084 and 0.097 against near-zero human values) and E2 too anti-TTB (-0.348 vs -0.265). E1 remains not anti-tally enough (-0.237 vs -0.432). The common cause is that low-|D| trials are now almost always far from 0.5: psi*sign*D/(kappa_dead+|D|) saturates for the T=0, D about 0.13 cells in E12, and omega*T with beta*omega around 1.2-2.0 pushes T=+/-1 dead-zone rows close to ceiling or floor in E11/E3. This creates the sharp low-D step that humans do not show in E12, while the same hard threshold likely moves some E1 trials into a pro-tally fallback and reduces its negative effect.
Rationale: Keep the thresholded validity-weighted anti-validity family, but re-tune the two dead-zone components rather than add new mechanisms. (1) Make the zero-tally repair graded, not saturated: raise kappa_dead from 0.06-0.16 toward roughly 0.25-0.60 and lower psi from 0.90-1.40 toward 0.30-0.70, calibrating E14 and E12 jointly because the current psi branch is what fixes E14 but breaks E12. (2) Soften the nonzero-tally fallback: replace omega*T with omega*tanh(T/kappa_tally) or a winsorized version, keeping beta*omega scaled so the E16 row spread stays near 3.5-3.7 but making T=+/-1 much less decisive than T=+/-2. This should preserve the E16 win while reducing E11/E3/E12 over-contrast. (3) Slightly weaken the clear-branch anti-validity gain, for example tau toward 0.9-1.8, lam toward 1.3-1.8, or beta toward 1.8-2.3, to pull E3/E11/E2/E6/E7 back toward their real values, while verifying that E13, E9 and E14 do not regress. (4) Replace the binary |D|<theta switch with a smooth sigmoidal blend across the boundary to remove threshold artifacts, and widen the subject distributions for theta, psi and omega so between-subject spread, especially in E3, E11 and E16, looks more like the human variances. Do not restore a global tally term or conflict-gain interaction; this should remain a calibration of the accepted thresholded architecture.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2040 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.2054 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate fixes part of the over-decisiveness problem: E12 drops from the accepted base's 0.616 to 0.082 against a real value of 0.036, E11 drops to 0.463 against 0.303, E3 drops to 0.621 against 0.362, and E14/E1/E15 remain close to their targets. But the repair costs more than it buys. E16 collapses from the accepted base value of 3.597 to 2.305 against a real value of 3.695, and its between-subject variance is 1.26 versus the human 11.40. E2 worsens to -0.432 against -0.265, E6 to 0.218 against 0.012, E8 to 0.289 against 0.120, and E13 regresses to -0.348 against -0.513 from the accepted base's -0.500. The likely culprit is the new power-compressed tally fallback, score proportional to (|T|/kappa)^p with p above 1 and kappa near 2: it flattens the T=+/-2 rows too much, destroying the E16 spread, while still leaving T=+/-1 rows too decisive, so E3/E11/E6/E8 remain overcontrasted. The zero-tally dilution helped E12 but is still about 2.3 times too large, and the shift in theta/blend appears to remove some of the graded low-D signal that E13 needs.
Rationale: The gate rejected this candidate, so the next proposal should build on the accepted base, which already matched E16, E13, E14 and E9 well. Do not keep the present global power compression of the tally fallback. Replace it with a shifted or two-piece tally transform that keeps |T|<=1 close to neutral but restores the accepted base's strong |T|=2 separation: for example a smooth hinge on |T|-c with c near 0.8-1.2, optionally softened to avoid a hard switch, with kappa/beta rescaled so E16 row-logit variance returns to about 3.5-3.8. That single change should reduce the E3/E11/E6/E8/E7 overresponding without touching the clear-branch anti-validity transform that E1 and E9 depend on. Keep only the current zero-tally fragmented-evidence dilution, but strengthen the dilution parameter, e.g. rho_disc around 1.2-2.0, to bring E12 closer to 0.036 while leaving n_disc<=2 pairs unaffected so E14 and E13 single-cue contrasts survive. Also add genuine subject heterogeneity in the tally arm by widening omega_mag and beta or adding a mixture, targeting E16 population variance near the observed 11.4 rather than 1.3. Do not repeat the earlier broad clear-branch weakening; if E2 or E6 remain high after the offset fix, shift tau upward only slightly and verify E1, E9 and E13 do not regress.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.2054 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.2060 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4

Interpretation: The candidate is a genuine thresholded anti-validity implementation with a dead-zone tally fallback, and it is close on several experiments: E1 (-0.378 vs -0.432), E2 (-0.312 vs -0.265), E4 (0.551 vs 0.530), E9 (0.619 vs 0.601), E14 (0.412 vs 0.389), and E15 (-0.020 vs -0.005). However, it fails the two targets the architecture was built around. E16 collapses to 2.179 against the human 3.695, and its between-subject variance is only 1.77 against 11.40. The shifted tally transform max(0, |T|-c) with c near 0.8-1.2 effectively erases |T|=1 rows and weakens the |T|=2 rows too much, so the row-logit dispersion disappears. E13 is too weak (-0.267 vs -0.513); the low-D graded contrast and the high-D clear-branch contrast are no longer balanced in the way the real subjects show. At the same time the candidate still over-responds in the scattered-evidence experiments: E3 gives 0.718 against 0.362, E6 gives 0.195 against 0.012, E8 gives 0.288 against 0.120, E11 gives 0.446 against 0.303, and E12 gives 0.139 against 0.036. These are the rows where many features discriminate and the zero-tally dead-zone branch should dilute the evidence far more than it currently does.
Rationale: Keep the prescribed thresholded validity-weighted anti-validity family but re-calibrate the dead-zone components. First, replace the single shifted tally transform with a two-level piecewise gain: for |T| <= 1, use a weak omega_low around 0.10-0.35 so those rows stay near chance, and for |T| >= 2, use a much stronger omega_high around 1.8-2.8, with beta * omega_high rescaled so E16 row-logit variance returns to about 3.5-3.8. Add a subject-level mixture or log-normal spread on omega_high to raise the E16 between-subject variance toward the observed 10-12; this also gives the loop's population variance the heterogeneity it currently lacks. Second, strengthen the fragmented-evidence dilution in the zero-tally branch: raise rho_disc to roughly 4-8, or make dilution steeper per additional discriminating feature. This should push E12, E11, E3, and the scattered-evidence rows in E6, E7, and E8 down toward their small human values, while leaving n_disc <= 2 pairs intact so E13 and E14 single-cue contrasts survive. Third, do not weaken the clear branch globally because E1, E9, and the anti-validity core depend on it. Instead smooth or shift the dead-zone boundary so moderate-|D| multi-feature rows do not jump abruptly into the decisive clear branch; if E13 is still too weak after the first two repairs, adjust the zero-tally branch parameters for n_disc <= 2, such as psi or kappa_dead, before touching lam or beta.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.2060 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.2230 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate's aggregate loss of 0.2230 is worse than the accepted base's 0.2040, and the gate correctly rejected it. The failure is concentrated in two places the accepted base had solved. E16 collapses from 3.597 to 1.328 row-logit variance against a human 3.695: the two-level tally arm sends the |T|=1 rows through a deliberately weak weight (beta * omega_low around 0.2 to 0.8), and even the |T|=2 rows get an omega_high that is far weaker than intended because exp of a uniform on [-3, 0.5] piles probability mass near zero, putting beta * omega_high near 1.1 on average instead of the 1.8-2.8 needed for row-logit variance near 3.6-3.8. E13 regresses from -0.500 to -0.270 because it is built from single-cue pairs with |T|=1, which now hit the weak tally level instead of the strong fallback the base used. E6, E8, E9 and E10 also drift in the wrong direction. The one clear success is E12: the zero-tally fragmented-evidence dilution exp(-rho_disc * (n_disc - 2)) brings it from the base's 0.616 down to 0.064, close to the human 0.036, and E1 improves from -0.237 to -0.375 toward the human -0.432. This shows the dilution component is doing its job, while every one of the three rejected iterations shared a modified nonzero-tally arm that repeatedly broke E16 and E13.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base, not on this candidate. My previous push to add a two-level tally gain with a lognormally spread omega_high was rejected by the gate; the tally-arm surgery is what destroyed E16 and E13 here, so drop all of it: no |T|<=1 versus |T|>=2 split, no shifted hinge, no power compression, and no lognormal spread on the tally weight. Keep the base's single strong tally weight for all nonzero T exactly as it is, since that is the component that produced E16 = 3.597, E13 = -0.500 and E14 = 0.381. Make one minimal edit on top of the base: add only the zero-tally dilution, score = psi * sign * D / (kappa_dead + |D|) * exp(-rho_disc * max(0, n_disc - 2)), active only for |D| < theta and T = 0, with rho_disc around 0.9-1.4. That single change should cut the base's dominant E12 residual of about 0.58 down to roughly 0.03-0.06 while leaving E13, E14, E16, E4, E9, E10 and E15 untouched, because those rows have either n_disc <= 2 or T not equal to 0. Do not touch lam, tau, beta, theta, psi, kappa_dead or omega in the same edit. If E3, E11 or E1 are still off after banking the E12 win, handle them in a later edit with clear-branch-only knobs such as a small n_disc- or |D|-dependent gain inside the saturating transform, but do not fix them by changing the tally arm again.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.2230 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1717 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## Response

{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is the strongest in this loop so far: aggregate loss dropped from 0.2040 to 0.1717 and the gate accepted it. The isolated zero-tally dilution strategy I recommended in iteration 5 worked exactly as intended: E12 fell from the accepted base's 0.616 to 0.077 against a real value of 0.036, while the protected successes stayed largely intact. E13 is now nearly perfect (-0.537 vs -0.513), E14 remains close (0.432 vs 0.389), E10 is essentially exact (0.066 vs 0.068), E15 is small (-0.033 vs -0.005), E4 stays near target (0.487 vs 0.530), and E16 holds at 3.281 against 3.695 with acceptable variance. The theory is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family and its two core mechanisms, the dead-zone tally fallback and the thresholded anti-validity transform, are both doing real work. The remaining failure is nonetheless systematic and diagnosable. Four experiments share one stimulus class: rows where the unweighted tally T equals zero (balanced feature counts), many features discriminate simultaneously, and the validity-weighted magnitude |D| lands above theta. Those rows skip the dead-zone dilution entirely and hit the clear-branch saturating anti-validity transform at full strength, producing decisive responses where humans stay near chance or respond only moderately. This is exactly why E3 is 0.719 against 0.362, E6 is 0.205 against 0.012, E8 is 0.316 against 0.120, and E11 is 0.439 against 0.303. E12 was only one instance of this pattern, and the same cure has not yet been extended to the branch where the rest of the pattern lives. Two secondary residuals remain but are less systematic: E1 is insufficiently anti-validity (-0.326 vs -0.432) on concentrated high-|D| rows, and E2 is too anti-TTB (-0.395 vs -0.265).",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the mechanism family and make one more minimal, isolated edit of the same kind that was just accepted: extend the existing fragmented-evidence dilution into the clear branch, but only for T=0 rows. Concretely, for |D| >= theta and T = 0, multiply the clear-branch score by exp(-rho_clear * max(0, n_disc - k)) with a gate k around 4 or 5 (so n_disc of 4 or fewer is untouched and n_disc of 5-6 is suppressed) and its own rho_clear parameter, starting around 0.3-0.5, weaker than the dead-zone rho_disc. This should pull E3, E6, E8 and E11 toward their human values without touching the tally arm, theta, psi, kappa_dead, lam, tau, beta, omega or the dead-zone dilution. Guardrails for the proposer: E4 currently sits at 0.487 against 0.530 and its rows are T=0 with n_disc=4, so the gate must leave n_disc=4 undiluted or E4 will collapse toward chance; E1, E9, E10 and E16 rows have nonzero T and must remain unchanged; E13 and E14 rows have n_disc=2 and are already protected by the max(0, n_disc-2) form. Verify E12 does not change, since its rows are T=0 but |D| small and already handled in the dead zone. One expected collision is E5: its cp row is T=0 with n_disc=6, and E5 is currently near its real value (0.002 vs -0.030), so dilution may push it positive; if that happens, try the n_disc>=6 gate or a milder rho_clear rather than reverting the whole edit. Do not modify the nonzero-tally arm in any way: the prior three rejections all followed tally-arm surgery, and the accepted edit's success depended on leaving it alone. After the dilution is banked, the remaining E1 and E2 residuals can be addressed with clear-branch-only knobs such as a slightly larger lam or smaller tau for E1 (checking E9 and E13 do not regress) and a mild weakening of rows where the highest-validity cue and the validity-weighted sign disagree for E2, but only in a separate later edit."
