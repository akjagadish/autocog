# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_8" and "pi_5") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_8" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_8
Conflict-modulated continuous anti-validity with inverse-validity conflict counting and a tally-regularized response (CMCAV-iv). Subjects form a continuous validity-weighted difference D = sum_j v_j^gamma_i * (A_j - B_j), mostly apply a negative validity-weighting sign, and respond through a fluid evidence-gated continuous transform S_i = -lambda_i * G(C) * D / (kappa_i + abs(D) + r_i) + bias_i + w_t * T. There is no fixed threshold, no dead zone, and no single fixed half-saturation constant. The conflict gain G(C) depends on both concentration of the dominant validity-weighted contribution and an inverse-validity-weighted count of disagreeing features, so conflict from many low-validity cues strongly suppresses responding while concentrated high-validity evidence remains effective. A small unidirectional tally term T = (1/n) * sum_j (A_j - B_j) with negative weight supports count-driven anti-validity gradients.

## THEORY 2 — pi_5
Compressive Negative Validity-Weighted integration with subject-level saturation (CNVW-tau). Each subject forms D = sum_j v_j^gamma_i * (A_j - B_j), where v_j are the instructed expert validities and gamma_i is a subject-level validity exponent. The weighted difference is passed through a strongly saturating bounded transform psi(D) = D / (tau_i + abs(D)), with a small subject-level half-saturation constant tau_i. Most subjects apply a negative sign, S_i = -lambda_i * psi(D) + bias_i, while a minority apply a positive sign. Choice probability is p(A) = epsilon_i/2 + (1 - epsilon_i) * sigmoid(beta_i * S_i).

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_8)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.9, 0.636396, 0.636396, 0.8, 0.636396, 0.636396]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** This design creates matched validity-weighted difference D pairs to isolate conflict and tally modulation in CMCAV-iv. Feature 1 has validity 0.90 and features 2-3 have validity 0.90/sqrt(2) approx 0.636396, so at central gamma=2.0 one win on feature 1 and two wins on features 2-3 both give D = +0.81. Likewise feature 4 has validity 0.80 and features 5-6 have validity 0.80/sqrt(2) approx 0.565685, so one win on feature 4 and two wins on features 5-6 both give D = +0.64. The exact A/B mirrors give D = -0.81 and -0.64. CNVW-tau uses only the scalar D through its saturating psi(D), so it must predict identical pA within every matched D pair, regardless of lambda, tau, beta, bias, or lapse. CMCAV-iv, by contrast, has a conflict gain that is high when evidence is concentrated in one high-validity discriminating feature and low when the same D is spread across two low-validity discriminating features, while its negative tally term also separates the pairs. Under central parameters CMCAV gives for the eight rows approximately 0.09, 0.25, 0.75, 0.91, 0.09, 0.29, 0.71, 0.91, while CNVW gives about 0.22, 0.22, 0.78, 0.78, 0.22, 0.22, 0.78, 0.78 for D +/-0.81 and +/-0.64 respectively. This produces a within-D crossover that CNVW cannot produce, and extreme gamma values in the specified ranges shift the D match only slightly and cannot account for the large concentrated-versus-diffuse gap. All non-discriminating features are ties to give clean control of D and tally; the 8 unique pairs repeat 12 times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates the concentrated-versus-diffuse conflict contrast that CMCAV-iv predicts but scalar-D CNVW-tau cannot produce. Each trial response is first recoded as anti-validity choice: choose B when D is positive, choose A when D is negative. Within each subject, the anti-validity rate is averaged for the four concentrated single-feature pairs and the four diffuse two-feature pairs, giving 48 trials in each group. The raw contrast is concentrated anti-rate minus diffuse anti-rate. Because both theories allow a small positive-sign subgroup, each subject's contrast is then oriented by whether the subject's overall anti-validity rate is above or below 0.5, making the contrast sign-invariant across anti-validity and pro-validity responders. Under CNVW-tau, choice probability is a function only of the scalar D, so this oriented contrast is very close to zero, with any small deviation dominated by the intentional feature-4 versus features-5-6 D mismatch. Under CMCAV-iv, conflict gain strongly suppresses evidence spread across two lower-validity features, so concentrated evidence produces more anti-validity responding and the oriented contrast is large and positive. Using all eight specified pairs keeps trial counts high, reducing between-subject sampling noise.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.707106, 0.707106, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** CNVW-tau is a scalar-D theory: D = sum_j v_j^gamma * (A_j - B_j), psi(D) = D / (tau + abs(D)), and p(A) cannot depend on how a zero D is built. The validities [0.7071, 0.7071, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5] give v^2 weights of 0.5 for the two high-validity cues and 0.25 for the four low-validity cues at gamma = 2, so one high-cue win exactly cancels two low-cue wins. All four unique pairs are engineered to have D = 0 exactly at gamma = 2, while their unweighted tally differences (sum of A ratings minus sum of B ratings) are -2, -1, +1, +2, i.e. T = -1/3, -1/6, +1/6, +1/3. CNVW-tau therefore predicts a flat p(A) across all four rows because psi(0) = 0 and only bias/lapse can move the probability, with no tally term. CMCAV-iv also has a zero saturating term at D = 0, but it adds w_t * T with negative w_t in [-0.32, -0.14], so its score decreases monotonically as T increases. Under central CMCAV parameters (beta = 2.0, w_t = -0.23, bias = 0, lapse = 0.06) the predicted p(A) values are approximately 0.536, 0.518, 0.482, 0.464; the endpoint separation grows with beta and abs(w_t). This creates a flat-versus-tally-graded dissociation: CNVW-tau cannot make D = 0 trials depend on T, while CMCAV-iv cannot remove the tally gradient unless w_t = 0, which is outside its range. The four unique pairs are repeated 24 times each for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric measures the dispersion of a subject's four row-wise choice log-odds. CNVW-tau uses a strongly saturating transform with small tau, so subjects with gamma away from 2 produce large validity-weighted differences and the four log-odds are pushed far apart, regardless of whether the monotone direction is increasing or decreasing. CMCAV-iv instead has a fluid conflict-gated transform and only a weak negative tally term, so the four row log-odds remain close to chance. Averaging subject-level logit variances, rather than pooled row proportions, prevents individual sign flips in CNVW-tau from cancelling and keeps the metric stable per subject.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all 16 experiments neither theory is task-invariant. pi_5 is excellent on Experiment 1 (pred 0.0158 vs obs -0.0050), and closer on Experiments 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 15, 16; pi_8 is closer on Experiments 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14. The two detailed experiments are especially diagnostic. Experiment 1 was built to isolate pi_8's conflict-gain and tally mechanisms, and the observed concentrated-vs-diffuse contrast is essentially zero (-0.0050), while pi_8 predicts a large positive contrast (0.1862). This directly falsifies the conflict-modulated anti-validity machinery of pi_8. Experiment 2 produces a huge row-wise logit variance (3.6952) that both theories miss by a wide margin (pi_5: 0.4649, pi_8: 0.1757), indicating a strong effect when the validity-weighted difference is zero that neither theory contains. pi_5's small-tau saturation also badly overpredicts Experiment 14 (0.3367 vs 0.0356), while pi_8 is closer but still too high (0.1200). Thus pi_5 has the right scalar-D core for Experiment 1 but the wrong saturation and no mechanism for the zero-D tally effect; pi_8 has extra conflict/tally structure that is not supported by Experiment 1. Since both theories explain some experiments but fail critical others, a new theory is warranted rather than a parameter refit.",

  "recommendation": "Replace pi_8 with a thresholded validity-weighted anti-validity theory with tally fallback in the dead zone. Core proposal: each subject computes D_i = sum_j v_j^{gamma_i} * (A_j - B_j) with a subject-level validity exponent gamma_i (wide distribution around 2). If |D_i| < theta_i, the validity signal is treated as ambiguous and choice is driven by an unweighted tally term T = sum_j (A_j - B_j) with subject-level weight omega_i (allow both signs); if |D_i| >= theta_i, choice follows a mostly negative anti-validity sign through a moderately saturating transform S_i = sign_i * lambda_i * D_i / (tau_i + |D_i|) + bias_i. Choice probability is p(A) = lapse/2 + (1-lapse) * sigmoid(beta_i * S_i). There is no conflict-gain interaction and no global tally term outside the dead zone. Suggested parameter ranges: gamma_i wide enough to generate heterogeneity (e.g., 1.0-3.0 or a mixture), theta_i around 0.10-0.20, tau_i moderate (0.5-2.0) rather than pi_5's tiny tau, beta_i moderate-high, and omega_i large enough that beta*omega on the tally sum gives logit variance of roughly 3-4 in Experiment 2. This theory should match Experiment 1 because all D values are far above theta, so concentrated and diffuse pairs with equal D give equal choice probabilities. It should match Experiment 2 because D=0 falls in the dead zone and the tally fallback creates strong row-wise dispersion. It should fix Experiment 14 because small |D| values below theta produce almost no validity-driven step, while larger orienting values still drive anti-validity contrasts. This differs from pi_5 by adding the dead-zone tally fallback and relaxing the small-tau saturation, and differs from pi_8 by removing conflict modulation and making the tally term conditional on ambiguity rather than global."
