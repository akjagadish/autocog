# improvement_iter_05_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a NEW model instantiation of an EXISTING theory, given arbiter feedback on the previous instantiation. The theory's prose claim is fixed — you are NOT redefining the theory. You are regenerating only the runnable bits: the `predict` function, the `policy` function, and the `parameters` ranges. The newly proposed model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The goal of the model improvement process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
If your model fails to compile or behaves badly, you may receive feedback and have to propose another instantiation. Iterate until accepted.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new model instance that ignores the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ROUND THEORIES
The arbiter compared the two theories below this round. Your job is to regenerate ONLY the runnable bits (`predict`, `policy`, `parameters`) of the one tagged **TO REVISE**, keeping its description verbatim. The other theory is shown for context — it is NOT being changed.

### THEORY 1 — `pi_7` **TO REVISE**

**Description (PRESERVE VERBATIM — do not rewrite the prose):**
Thresholded anti-validity utility with Gaussian threshold noise and a small validity-consistent soft leak (TAVU-tn). Subjects compute a validity-weighted difference D = sum_j v_j^gamma_i * (A_j - B_j). A subject-level latent sign dominates: most subjects use negative weighting and make the anti-validity choice when |D| exceeds a subject-level threshold tau_i, but threshold placement is noisy across trials, so the aggregate threshold boundary is graded rather than a step. Within the dead zone and below the sign-following ceiling, subjects fall back on a subject-level bias. A small plain-D sigmoidal leak in the validity-consistent direction weakly damps extreme anti choices at large |D|. A uniform lapse adds residual noise. The dominant process remains thresholded sign, not continuous magnitude accumulation.

    Most subjects use a negative sign and choose the lower-D option only
    when |D| exceeds a subject-level threshold tau. Threshold placement
    is noisy across trials, implemented analytically as
    p_above = Phi((|D| - tau) / tau_sd). Within the dead zone and with
    1 - follow_max probability, subjects fall back on a subject-level
    bias. A small plain-D sigmoidal leak in the validity-consistent
    direction weakly reduces extreme anti choices. A uniform lapse adds
    residual noise.

### THEORY 2 — `pi_5` (other theory — context only, NOT revised)

**Description:**
Compressive Negative Validity-Weighted integration with subject-level saturation (CNVW-tau). Each subject forms D = sum_j v_j^gamma_i * (A_j - B_j), where v_j are the instructed expert validities and gamma_i is a subject-level validity exponent. The weighted difference is passed through a strongly saturating bounded transform psi(D) = D / (tau_i + abs(D)), with a small subject-level half-saturation constant tau_i. Most subjects apply a negative sign, S_i = -lambda_i * psi(D) + bias_i, while a minority apply a positive sign. Choice probability is p(A) = epsilon_i/2 + (1 - epsilon_i) * sigmoid(beta_i * S_i). There is no feature-tally term and no conflict-gating interaction.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_7`).

Keep the pi_7 TAVU-tn description verbatim and regenerate only the model instantiation. In the new parameter ranges, make the dead zone explicit: sample subject tau mostly in the range 0.30 to 0.45 in the same validity-weighted D units used by the designs, with tau_sd small, roughly 0.02 to 0.08, so p_above = Phi((abs(D) - tau) / tau_sd) is near zero inside Experiment 2's 0.03 < abs(D) < 0.16 window but near one for the larger mirror pairs in Experiment 1, with abs(D) around 0.41, 0.71, and 1.19, and for the strong contrasts in Experiment 11. Set soft_weight to zero or a very small upper bound such as 0.00 to 0.03, and keep its beta_soft small enough that the validity-consistent leak contributes almost nothing below abs(D) = 0.2, otherwise the leak reintroduces the zero-crossing step. Keep p_negative high, around 0.75 to 0.90, and set follow_max in the 0.85 to 1.0 range so that once the threshold is crossed the anti sign dominates. Moderate the suprathreshold ceiling with a bias and lapse calibration that targets Experiment 1's mirror separation near 0.25 to 0.35 rather than the current 0.64, while preserving Experiment 11 near 0.60 and pushing Experiment 3 toward -0.43. Recalibrate gamma jointly with tau, likely in a restricted range near 1.5 to 2.5, and validate the regenerated ranges against all twelve experiments, not only Experiments 1 and 2, so the strong fits on Experiments 4, 7, 8, 10, and 11 are not lost while the new dead zone fixes Experiments 1 and 2.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.416)

**Description**
Validity-gated slipped-start Inverted Take-the-Best (GSS-ITTB). People order cues by stated validity and normally use the first discriminating cue, inverting its recommendation with subject-specific probability q_i. Attentional slips to later ordered cues are not driven by feature count alone; they occur mainly when the first discriminator's validity is below a threshold, and are strongly suppressed for first discriminators with validity 0.90 or higher. When a slip occurs, the later discriminating cue controls the response with a boosted inversion probability, reflecting stronger contra-indicator responding in the low-validity regime. Trials with no discriminating cue are resolved by subject-level bias, and a small lapse adds residual noise. There is no graded validity-weighted accumulation and no continuous logit over a compensatory score.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.312)

**Description**
Validity-weighted evidence accumulation with conflict-gated confidence (VWEA-CG). People integrate binary feature differences by weighting each difference by its communicated validity raised to a subject-specific power. A majority of subjects use a negative-valence or contra-indicator rule, so a feature advantage counts against an option, while a minority use positive-valence trust. Critically, the effective decisiveness of that validity-weighted evidence is attenuated when the evidence strongly conflicts with the simple feature tally: when the validity-weighted score is large but the number of feature-wise wins is nearly tied, the decision is treated as less diagnostic. Choices are generated by a softmax over this conflict-gated signed evidence score, plus a uniform lapse.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.100)

**Description**
Negative Validity-Weighted Additive (NWA): people combine all binary feature differences linearly, but assign negative weight to a feature advantage, and the absolute weight magnitude increases with the feature's stated validity. Formally, choice is based on S = sum_j w_j * (A_j - B_j), with w_j = -v_j^gamma (gamma > 0), so an option's cue advantage makes that option less likely to be chosen. Choice probability uses a softmax/sigmoid over this score with inverse temperature beta, plus a small uniform lapse epsilon.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1899 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1411 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1893 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.1675 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.1515 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1411 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

`rationale`: Kept the TAVU-tn architecture unchanged. The key revision is to lower the suprathreshold ceiling rather than raise the dead-zone threshold all the way to 0.30-0.40. The previous simulation showed Experiment 8's high-versus-low consistency was driven mainly by follow_max and lapse, not by tau: moving tau upward leaves high-|D| consistency near the ceiling while low-|D| consistency falls to chance, so Exp 8 stays too large and Exp 2/9 lose their graded small-|D| contrasts. I therefore kept tau just above the Experiment 12 small-|D| window, at [0.22, 0.26], slightly widened tau_sd to [0.04, 0.07] so D around 0.17-0.22 remains partially graded, and reduced follow_max to [0.66, 0.74] with lapse [0.12, 0.16]. This directly reduces the strong threshold-mediated overshoots in Experiments 3, 6, 8, and 11. To compensate for the weaker ceiling and preserve the anti-validity separation in Experiments 1 and 9, p_negative remains high, [0.88, 0.94], instead of being lowered into the 0.80-0.88 band. The soft leak is unchanged and still contributes almost nothing below |D| = 0.2.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful TAVU-tn implementation in mechanism but not in the arbiter's prescribed parameter space: it deliberately lowers tau to 0.20-0.24 instead of the prescribed 0.30-0.45 dead zone. The result is a mixed but diagnostically patterned fit. It does well on several near-zero and dead-zone targets: Experiment 1 (-0.451 vs -0.432), Experiment 5 (0.010 vs -0.030), Experiment 7 (-0.001 vs 0.006), Experiment 9 (0.558 vs 0.601), Experiment 10 (0.001 vs 0.068), and Experiment 12 (0.061 vs 0.036). However, it systematically overproduces threshold-mediated anti-validity responding once |D| reaches moderate values: Experiment 8 is 0.358 vs 0.120, Experiment 11 is 0.537 vs 0.303, Experiment 3 is 0.595 vs 0.362, Experiment 4 is 0.641 vs 0.530, and Experiment 6 is 0.120 vs 0.012. Experiment 2 is also too weak in the anti-TTB direction (-0.194 vs -0.265). The candidate's stated reason for lowering tau was to avoid a too-large Experiment 8 step and preserve Experiment 9, but the simulated Experiment 8 step is already three times the real value, so that rationale is contradicted by the simulation itself.
Rationale: Regenerate on top of this accepted base, keeping the TAVU-tn architecture but correcting the threshold placement and suprathreshold ceiling. Specifically: (1) move the subject-level tau distribution back toward the arbiter's prescribed dead zone, roughly tau in [0.30, 0.40] or at least a mean near 0.30-0.38, so moderate-|D| contrasts no longer trigger the sign rule so readily; this should directly shrink the Experiment 6, 8, and 11 overshoots. (2) Do not preserve Experiment 9 by lowering tau; instead keep p_negative high and let the larger-|D| pairs carry the anti-validity effect, while allowing the D=0.17 pairs to be graded. (3) Reduce the too-strong suprathreshold ceiling: lower p_negative from 0.89-0.93 toward the prescribed 0.80-0.88 range, reduce follow_max toward roughly 0.75-0.88, and/or raise lapse modestly to around 0.12-0.18. These are minor in-family recalibrations that should pull Experiments 3, 4, 8, and 11 down toward their real values without flipping the correct directional signs or reintroducing the zero-crossing step. (4) Validate the revised ranges against all twelve experiments, watching that Experiment 1 remains near -0.43 and Experiment 9 near 0.60 while the currently inflated moderate-|D| steps come down.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1899 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1411 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is a real aggregate improvement (0.1899 -> 0.1411) and it now fits several near-zero and graded targets well: Experiment 4 (0.512 vs 0.530), Experiment 5 (-0.006 vs -0.030), Experiment 7 (-0.017 vs 0.006), Experiment 10 (0.038 vs 0.068), Experiment 11 (0.346 vs 0.303), and Experiment 12 (0.056 vs 0.036). However, the central calibration choice—tau kept low at [0.22, 0.26] while follow_max is cut to [0.66, 0.74]—produces exactly the pattern one would expect from a global ceiling reduction without a true dead zone. Moderate-validity contrasts still cross threshold too readily, leaving Experiment 8 (0.276 vs 0.120), Experiment 6 (0.099 vs 0.012), and Experiment 3 (0.453 vs 0.362) too anti-validity driven. At the same time, the low ceiling suppresses the strong contrasts that should carry the effect, so Experiment 1 (-0.233 vs -0.432) and Experiment 9 (0.450 vs 0.601) are now too weak. Experiment 2 also remains too weak in the anti-TTB direction (-0.139 vs -0.265). The candidate still drifts from the arbiter-prescribed calibration, especially on tau and follow_max, and the resulting miss pattern is diagnostic of that drift.
Rationale: Keep the TAVU-tn code and architecture, but rebalance the threshold and ceiling jointly instead of compensating for a low tau by globally lowering follow_max. Move tau back into the prescribed dead-zone region, e.g. sample tau mostly in [0.30, 0.40] with tau_sd around [0.04, 0.08], so D values below about 0.25 stay in the bias dead zone while the larger mirror pairs still cross. Raise follow_max back toward [0.80, 0.92] to restore strong-contrast anti-validity in Experiments 1 and 9, and keep p_negative relatively high, around [0.82, 0.92], unless the moderate-D overshoot persists after the tau increase. Then calibrate bias, lapse, and the soft leak jointly against all twelve experiments: target Experiment 1 near -0.35 to -0.45, Experiment 9 near 0.55 to 0.62, and bring Experiment 8 below about 0.20 while preserving the gains on Experiments 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, and 12. Do not lower tau further to try to preserve Experiment 9; the current simulation shows that maneuver already cost Experiment 9 about 0.15 while failing to control Experiment 8. This is a parameter re-calibration of the existing TAVU-tn mechanism, not a change of mechanism family.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1411 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1893 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is a faithful TAVU-tn instantiation of the prescribed dead-zone calibration, but the gate correctly rejected it: loss rose from 0.1411 to 0.1893. Compared with the accepted iter-2 base, the current candidate improves E1 (-0.233 -> -0.270), E2 (-0.139 -> -0.165), E3 (0.453 -> 0.439), and E10 (0.038 -> 0.069), but it degrades several experiments substantially: E4 drops from 0.512 to 0.430 (real 0.530), E6 rises from 0.099 to 0.167 (real 0.012), E8 rises from 0.276 to 0.349 (real 0.120), E9 falls from 0.450 to 0.415 (real 0.601), and E11 rises from 0.346 to 0.433 (real 0.303). The pattern is diagnostic of the raised tau being combined with a too-small tau_sd. With tau in [0.30, 0.38] and tau_sd only [0.05, 0.09], p_above = Phi((|D|-tau)/tau_sd) becomes nearly binary: low-|D| stimuli sit below tau with p_above near zero while high-|D| stimuli still saturate at p_above near one. That sharpens, not softens, the low-vs-high threshold contrast, which is exactly what E6, E8, and E11 penalize. It also traps the moderate-|D| contrasts in E4 and E9 inside the dead zone, weakening those anti-validity effects. The prior advice to raise tau and follow_max jointly was rejected by the gate, and the current candidate is essentially that advice; it should not be repeated.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base rather than the rejected iter-3 candidate, and change only the threshold gradation. Keep tau near the accepted base or widen it only modestly (e.g. [0.18, 0.30], with most draws below 0.30), because moving tau up to 0.30-0.38 was the main cause of the E4/E9 weakness. Instead, substantially increase tau_sd to roughly [0.10, 0.18] so p_above changes gradually across |D|: low-|D| pairs are no longer completely dead, and high-|D| pairs are no longer a nearly perfect step. This should directly reduce the E6/E8/E11 threshold contrasts while leaving large-|D| anti-validity mostly intact. To compensate for the slight softening of strong contrasts, raise follow_max from the accepted base's [0.66, 0.74] to roughly [0.76, 0.86], but do not combine that with a high crisp tau as in iter 3. Keep p_negative high ([0.82, 0.90]), bias near [0.46, 0.54], lapse near [0.10, 0.14], and soft_weight very small. Validate against all twelve experiments, especially E4 > 0.48, E8 < 0.20, E9 > 0.55, E1 < -0.35, E11 < 0.35, and E6 < 0.05. This is a within-family recalibration of the TAVU-tn threshold noise, not a switch of mechanism.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1893 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.1675 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is a within-family TAVU-tn recalibration, but it is worse than the accepted iter-2 base on the metrics that matter most. Relative to that base it improves E1 (-0.233 -> -0.278), E2 (-0.139 -> -0.153), and E3 (0.453 -> 0.411), but it degrades E4 (0.512 -> 0.444 vs real 0.530), E6 (0.099 -> 0.162 vs real 0.012), E9 (0.450 -> 0.451 vs real 0.601), E10 (0.038 -> -0.004 vs real 0.068), E11 (0.346 -> 0.384 vs real 0.303), and notably E12 (0.056 -> 0.099 vs real 0.036). E8 remains badly inflated at 0.268 vs real 0.120. The diagnosis is specific: widening tau_sd to [0.08, 0.12] makes p_above graded over exactly the moderate-|D| region where it should stay nearly dead, so the thresholded sign leaks into E6/E8/E12 and produces too much low-vs-high or small-|D| responding. At the same time the strong absolute contrasts in E1/E2/E9 are still too weak, so the candidate neither fixes the accepted base's main deficits nor preserves its good fits. The gate rejection is correct.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base, not this candidate. First revert the failed threshold-gradation changes: return tau_sd to a tight range near the accepted value, and return follow_max to [0.66, 0.74]. That should restore the accepted levels on E4, E6, E8, E10, E11, and E12. Then use a lever that has not been fully exploited: raise p_negative strongly, toward [0.95, 1.00]. E1, E2, E4, and E9 are aggregate anti-validity metrics and scale with the net sign share, whereas E8, E11, and E12 are subject-level metrics that are largely indifferent to the sign-mixture share. To prevent the p_negative increase from worsening E3 and E6, lower bias to roughly [0.36, 0.46]: a lower dead-zone baseline directly shrinks the E6 low-|D| vs high-|D| gap and reduces the diffuse choice-level offset that inflates moderate-|D| anti-validity. Keep soft_weight at 0 or at most 0.03, and validate against all twelve experiments, targeting E1 <= -0.35, E9 >= 0.55, E4 >= 0.48, E6 <= 0.05, E8 <= 0.20, E11 <= 0.35, and E12 <= 0.06.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.1675 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.1515 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is a real TAVU-tn instantiation and it improves several previously weak points: E2 (-0.217 vs -0.265), E4 (0.530 vs 0.530), E6 (0.028 vs 0.012), E8 (0.134 vs 0.120), and E10 (0.058 vs 0.068) are now well matched. However, the success comes from a mechanism-level mistake: tau has been lowered to [0.08, 0.11], far below the prescribed dead zone of roughly 0.30-0.45 in validity-weighted D units. With tau this low, p_above=Phi((|D|-tau)/tau_sd) activates throughout the small-|D| regions that should remain inside the dead zone. The consequences are catastrophic on exactly the experiments that measure the dead zone: E12 jumps to 0.480 vs an observed 0.036, because its 0.03<|D|<0.16 window now crosses threshold; E11 jumps to 0.510 vs 0.303. The candidate also leaves the suprathreshold ceiling too low: follow_max is still only 0.66-0.74 with lapse 0.12-0.16, so the strong mirror contrasts in E1 (-0.250 vs -0.432) and E9 (0.500 vs 0.601) remain too weak. So the candidate has fixed several moderate-|D| metrics by effectively erasing the dead zone, but at the cost of the two most diagnostic dead-zone metrics. The gate rejection is correct; this is not a minor miss but a qualitative failure of the threshold placement.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base, not this candidate. The next recalibration should target the two independent miscalibrations without repeating the previously rejected extremes. (1) Restore and modestly raise the dead zone from the accepted base: sample tau mostly in [0.24, 0.30] (do not use the current candidate's 0.08-0.11, and do not jump all the way to the rejected 0.30-0.38). This keeps E12's 0.03<|D|<0.16 window below threshold so its step stays near zero, while still allowing the upper edge of E8's low-|D| mask to cross partially. (2) Keep tau_sd in the small-to-moderate prescribed band [0.04, 0.06]; do not return to the rejected wide [0.10, 0.18]. (3) Raise follow_max to roughly [0.78, 0.88] and lower lapse to [0.10, 0.14], keeping p_negative high near [0.90, 0.97] and soft_weight equal to zero; this is the missing lever for restoring E1 and E9 without changing the dead zone. (4) If E3 or E11 overshoot with the stronger ceiling, calibrate them with a very small soft leak as the magnitude-dependent damper—soft_weight [0.01, 0.03] with beta_soft small enough that it contributes almost nothing below |D|=0.2—rather than by lowering tau. Validate the new ranges on all twelve experiments, with explicit targets of E12 <= 0.06, E11 <= 0.36, E1 <= -0.35, E9 >= 0.55, E8 <= 0.18, and E3 in roughly 0.35-0.45. This is a within-family TAVU-tn re-calibration, not a mechanism change.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.1515 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep the theory's prose claim implicit but unchanged, and keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
