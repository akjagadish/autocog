# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_5") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Negative Validity-Weighted Additive (NWA): people combine all binary feature differences linearly, but assign negative weight to a feature advantage, and the absolute weight magnitude increases with the feature's stated validity. Formally, choice is based on S = sum_j w_j * (A_j - B_j), with w_j = -v_j^gamma (gamma > 0), so an option's cue advantage makes that option less likely to be chosen. Choice probability uses a softmax/sigmoid over this score with inverse temperature beta, plus a small uniform lapse epsilon.

## THEORY 2 — pi_5
Compressive Negative Validity-Weighted integration with subject-level saturation (CNVW-tau). Each subject forms D = sum_j v_j^gamma_i * (A_j - B_j), where v_j are the instructed expert validities and gamma_i is a subject-level validity exponent. The weighted difference is passed through a strongly saturating bounded transform psi(D) = D / (tau_i + abs(D)), with a small subject-level half-saturation constant tau_i. Most subjects apply a negative sign, S_i = -lambda_i * psi(D) + bias_i, while a minority apply a positive sign. Choice probability is p(A) = epsilon_i/2 + (1 - epsilon_i) * sigmoid(beta_i * S_i). There is no feature-tally term and no conflict-gating interaction.

**Rationale:** Five experts with a wide validity spread [0.92, 0.84, 0.74, 0.62, 0.52]. At gamma=2.25 their validity weights v^gamma are approximately [0.829, 0.675, 0.508, 0.341, 0.230]. The 16 unique pairs are built as eight positive-D pairs and their A/B mirrors. In the positive block, A wins a subset of experts so the validity-weighted difference D = sum_j v_j^gamma (A_j - B_j) takes the values 0.551, 0.773, 0.885, 0.925, 1.107, 1.233, 1.441, 1.567; the mirrored block has the same |D| values with D<0. NWA uses S = -D and a softmax with beta around 2.7, so p(A) falls steeply across the positive block (about 0.19, 0.12, 0.09, 0.08, 0.06, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02 with epsilon=0.02) and rises steeply across the negative block (about 0.81 to 0.98). CNVW-tau instead passes D through the saturating transform psi(D)=D/(tau+|D|) with tau in [0.10, 0.25]; for |D|>=0.55 this transform is already strongly saturated, so its p(A) is nearly flat within each sign: approximately 0.22 to 0.18 for D>0 and 0.78 to 0.82 for D<0 under central parameters. Thus both theories predict B for positive D and A for negative D, but NWA predicts a large within-sign graded effect while CNVW-tau predicts two flat plateaus. This is a quantitative dissociation that CNVW-tau's beta/lambda/bias parameters cannot remove, because those parameters shift the plateau levels but do not restore a steep D-magnitude slope.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Compute the validity-weighted difference D = sum_j v_j^gamma (A_j - B_j) with the design validities and central gamma 2.25. Mark each trial as sign-consistent when the subject chose B for D > 0 or A for D < 0, then regress this indicator on the absolute value of D. NWA predicts that sign-consistent choice probability rises steeply with |D|, giving a large positive slope. CNVW-tau passes D through the saturating transform D/(tau+abs(D)), which compresses all nonzero |D| values in this design into a flat plateau, so its within-sign slope remains near zero even though the overall sign-consistency level can be high. Using all 96 trials and the paired positive/negative D mirrors removes the sign main effect and pools information efficiently, keeping the between-subject variance small relative to the between-theory contrast.

**Rationale:** Five experts with validities [0.95, 0.90, 0.80, 0.60, 0.50] create a wide spread of validity weights. The 16 unique pairs are 8 positive validity-weighted difference values D = sum_j v_j^gamma (A_j - B_j) and their exact A/B mirrors. At gamma=2.25 the positive D values are approximately 0.077, 0.102, 0.209, 0.390, 0.548, 0.758, 0.968, 1.758. This spans both the near-zero region and the saturation region. CNVW-tau's saturating transform psi(D)=D/(tau+|D|) is steep near zero because psi is approximately D/tau, but it plateaus for large D, while NWA uses a single logistic in -D. Under central parameters (CNVW: gamma=2.25, tau=0.175, lambda=1.4, beta=1.4, bias=0, epsilon=0.05; NWA: gamma=2.25, beta=2.7, epsilon=0.01), the positive-D p(A) predictions are approximately: CNVW .362, .336, .268, .220, .201, .185, .177, .162; NWA .449, .432, .364, .261, .189, .118, .073, .014. Thus CNVW-tau predicts lower p(A) than NWA for D < 0.5 but higher p(A) for D > 0.5. This crossover is a quantitative signature that NWA cannot produce because its psychometric function is a single logistic with a very low lapse floor, whereas CNVW-tau combines a high near-zero slope with a bounded saturating transform. The mirrored negative-D trials test the same crossover on the opposite side and also allow bias/symmetry checks.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric measures a within-subject psychometric gain: how much more often choices follow the negative-validity prediction when validity-weighted evidence is strong (abs(D) >= 0.90) than when it is weak (abs(D) <= 0.25). D is computed as sum over features of v^2.25 * (A - B) using the instructed validities. NWA uses a single logistic in D, so its consistency rises sharply from weak to strong evidence, giving an expected raw high-minus-low contrast near 0.37. CNVW-tau instead passes D through D / (tau + abs(D)), a strongly saturating bounded transform, which compresses this gain to an expected raw contrast near 0.15. Taking the absolute value at the subject level makes the metric insensitive to the small minority of positive-sign subjects allowed by CNVW-tau, while preserving the large NWA gain. The contrast uses only repeated within-subject weak-evidence and extreme-evidence trials, so binomial noise is small and the between-theory gap is expected to be large relative to between-subject variance.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the full set of experiments, pi_5 is clearly the better of the two theories. pi_3's linear negative-validity logistic predicts steep validity-magnitude effects that are essentially absent from the observed data: Expt1 slope 0.1683 vs observed 0.0064; Expt2 gain 0.3681 vs observed 0.1200; Expt5 0.8928 vs observed 0.3622; Expt8 0.2812 vs observed 0.0117. pi_5's saturating transform substantially improves those cases, and it also matches Expt6 almost perfectly (0.5175 vs 0.5300). pi_3 is only clearly better on Expt3 and Expt4, and only modestly so; it also systematically underestimates between-subject variability, usually predicting variances an order of magnitude smaller than observed. The data therefore favor a direction-only, heavily compressed, subject-heterogeneous negative-validity process over a compensatory linear one. However, pi_5 is still not fully adequate: it retains too much graded evidence sensitivity in Expts 1, 2, and 8, overpredicts the signed effect in Expt5, and underpredicts the directional effects in Expts 3 and 4. This pattern suggests the true process is even less compensatory than pi_5: subjects appear to use a coarse, cue-order-based negative/anti-cue sign with little or no accumulation of strength, plus substantial subject-level engagement noise. Because pi_3 is fundamentally unable to produce this pattern from any plausible parameter range, it should be replaced by a new theory rather than refit.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_3 with a non-compensatory Inverted Take-the-Best / Anti-TTB heuristic. The theory assumes subjects order cues by stated validity, find the first discriminating cue, and then choose the option NOT favored by that cue with a subject-specific inversion probability q_i, drawn from a broad population distribution so that many subjects respond only weakly or sometimes follow the cue's recommendation. On trials with no discriminating cue, subjects use a subject-level bias, and a lapse probability adds further noise. Unlike pi_3, there is no linear accumulation of cue advantages and no continuous logit over a graded validity-weighted score; unlike pi_5, there is no saturating transform over the full validity-weighted difference and no deterministic subject-level sign. The new theory predicts near-flat within-sign slopes (Expt1), small weak-vs-strong gains (Expt2), moderate wrong-way TTB/first-cue effects (Expts 3\u20134), weak positive directional contrasts (Expts 5\u20136), near-zero aligned-vs-conflict effects (Expt7), and near-zero low-vs-high validity-sum effects (Expt8), while also generating the large between-subject variance seen in the real data. This makes it a stronger task-invariant competitor to pi_5 than pi_3 was."
