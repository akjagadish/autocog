# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_9`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with a gated compressive anti-validity theory. Keep D = sum_j v_j^gamma * (A_j - B_j) and a mostly negative sign mixture with a minority positive sign. Add a subject-level evidence threshold theta around D=0: when |D| < theta, attenuate the score multiplicatively by a small factor rho or use a mild dead-zone repair term that is applied identically for all tally values, rather than switching to a strong unweighted tally term; when |D| >= theta, use sign * lambda * D / (tau + |D|) + bias. Do not include the n_disc fragmented-evidence dilution term. If any unweighted tally influence is retained, make it a small continuous eta * T with eta constrained to be near zero, since Experiment 2 rules out a strong tally response but Experiment 18 still requires large row differences, which could instead arise from threshold crossings and broad beta/lambda/gamma/theta subject heterogeneity. Include lapse and subject-level variation in theta, beta, lambda, and gamma.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.417)

**Description**
Compressive Negative Validity-Weighted integration with subject-level saturation (CNVW-tau). Each subject forms D = sum_j v_j^gamma_i * (A_j - B_j), where v_j are the instructed expert validities and gamma_i is a subject-level validity exponent. The weighted difference is passed through a strongly saturating bounded transform psi(D) = D / (tau_i + abs(D)), with a small subject-level half-saturation constant tau_i. Most subjects apply a negative sign, S_i = -lambda_i * psi(D) + bias_i, while a minority apply a positive sign. Choice probability is p(A) = epsilon_i/2 + (1 - epsilon_i) * sigmoid(beta_i * S_i). There is no feature-tally term and no conflict-gating interaction.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.346)

**Description**
Thresholded validity-weighted anti-validity with a zero-tally dead-zone repair and fragmented-evidence dilution. Each subject forms D = sum_j v_j^{gamma_i} (A_j - B_j). When |D| is below a subject-level ambiguity threshold theta_i, the validity signal is treated as ambiguous. If the unweighted tally is nonzero, choice is driven by that tally through omega_i with a single strong weight, exactly as in the accepted base. If the tally is exactly zero, choice remains graded via a small signed validity-derived anti-validity term psi_i * sign_i * D / (kappa_i + |D|), but this term is now diluted multiplicatively by exp(-rho_disc_i * max(0, n_disc - 2)), where n_disc is the number of discriminating features. This dilution suppresses responding for zero-tally rows with many simultaneously disagreeing features while leaving zero-tally rows with only two discriminating features untouched. When |D| >= theta_i, choice follows the mostly negative anti-validity transform sign_i * lambda_i * D / (tau_i + |D|) + bias_i. Choice probability is p(A) = lapse_i/2 + (1-lapse_i) * sigmoid(beta_i * S_i).

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.279)

**Description**
Conflict-modulated continuous anti-validity with inverse-validity conflict counting and a tally-regularized response (CMCAV-iv). Subjects form a continuous validity-weighted difference D = sum_j v_j^gamma_i * (A_j - B_j), mostly apply a negative validity-weighting sign, and respond through a fluid evidence-gated continuous transform S_i = -lambda_i * G(C) * D / (kappa_i + abs(D) + r_i) + bias_i + w_t * T. There is no fixed threshold, no dead zone, and no single fixed half-saturation constant. The conflict gain G(C) depends on both concentration of the dominant validity-weighted contribution and an inverse-validity-weighted count of disagreeing features, so conflict from many low-validity cues strongly suppresses responding while concentrated high-validity evidence remains effective. A small unidirectional tally term T = (1/n) * sum_j (A_j - B_j) with negative weight supports count-driven anti-validity gradients.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL
Propose a novel theory from scratch based on all the information available, faithfully implementing the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed above. Do NOT simply reuse anything generated in past rounds.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- theory: The theoretical claim this theory makes about cognition.
- predict: Python source defining def predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray.
- policy: Python source defining def policy(probs) -> int.
- parameters: Parameter ranges (e.g. "[1.0, 10.0]") or choices (e.g. "{1, 2}"), sampled per subject.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this theory design; used to explain why this theory is better then the previous ones.

  "theory": "Gated compressively integrated anti-validity with a subject-level evidence dead zone. Each subject forms a validity-weighted difference D = sum_j v_j^gamma * (A_j - B_j), passes it through a compressive transform, and usually applies a negative sign to that transform, with a minority of subjects applying a positive sign. A subject-specific threshold theta defines a dead zone around D=0: when |D| < theta the otherwise identical anti-validity score is multiplicatively attenuated by a small factor rho, producing choices near indifference for small weighted evidence; when |D| >= theta the full compressively transformed score plus a small bias is used. A very small continuous unweighted tally leak eta*T is retained, but no strong tally switch and no fragmented-evidence dilution are included.",

The dead zone prevents small validity-weighted differences from being turned into strong saturating contrasts, which is the main mechanism needed to reduce the inflated small-D step in Experiment 12 and related over-responses in Experiments 6, 7, 8, and 11. Unlike pi_9, it does not switch to a strong unweighted tally inside the dead zone and does not include the n_disc fragmented-evidence dilution term; instead it applies the same attenuated validity-derived score for all tally values, with only a very small eta*T leakage. Broad subject heterogeneity in gamma, theta, lambda, and beta, combined with threshold crossings, allows large row-to-row differences in Experiments 16 and 18 while preserving a mostly negative anti-validity direction."
