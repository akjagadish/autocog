# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace pi_2 with a heterogeneous signed-validity weighting theory. The new theory should state that people weight binary feature differences by communicated validity, but the sign of the weighting is not uniform: a majority use the negative-valence/contra-indicator rule captured by pi_3, while a minority use positive-valence trust or near-equal tallying. Its predict function should compute score_i = sum_j s_i * v_j^gamma * (A_j - B_j) with softmax noise and lapse, where s_i is a subject-level valence sign or a cue-specific sign drawn from a latent strategy distribution, and gamma/beta vary across subjects. This should preserve the aggregate anti-tally/anti-TTB signs and close magnitudes seen in Exp3 and Exp4, while attenuating the overly sharp Exp1 prediction toward the observed 0.36 and reproducing the large per-subject variance. It differs from pi_2 because validities are used explicitly and equal tallying is only a special boundary; it differs from pi_3 by adding valence and strategy heterogeneity rather than a single fixed negative-weight rule.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.868)

**Description**
Negative Validity-Weighted Additive (NWA): people combine all binary feature differences linearly, but assign negative weight to a feature advantage, and the absolute weight magnitude increases with the feature's stated validity. Formally, choice is based on S = sum_j w_j * (A_j - B_j), with w_j = -v_j^gamma (gamma > 0), so an option's cue advantage makes that option less likely to be chosen. Choice probability uses a softmax/sigmoid over this score with inverse temperature beta, plus a small uniform lapse epsilon.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.383)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1103 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1103 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
People integrate binary expert-rating differences by weighting each feature difference by its communicated validity raised to a subject-specific power, but the sign of that validity weighting is heterogeneous across subjects. A majority of subjects adopt a negative-valence or contra-indicator rule: a feature advantage is treated as evidence against the product, with stronger validities receiving larger absolute weight. A minority of subjects instead use positive-valence trust: a feature advantage is treated as evidence favoring the product. Near-equal tallying is the boundary case of the model when validity weighting is effectively flat or when a subject's signed weighting is very small. The choice probability is produced by a softmax over the signed validity-weighted difference plus a small A-response bias, followed by a uniform lapse. Gamma, inverse temperature, bias, and lapse vary across subjects, producing the large between-subject variance observed in the data while preserving the aggregate negative-valence pattern.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np

    # Heterogeneous signed-validity weighting.
    # state is expected to be array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A and row 1 = option B.
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Heterogeneous signed-validity model expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a = stim[0]
    b = stim[1]

    v = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if v.size != a.size:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {v.size} does not match n_features {a.size}."
        )

    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    bias_a = float(parameters["bias_a"])

    # Latent strategy draw: most of the valence_draw mass is negative.
    # A subject uses positive-valence trust only when its latent draw falls
    # below its subject-level positive-strategy threshold. Because both
    # p_positive and valence_draw are sampled per subject, this creates
    # a stable subject-level sign with a minority of positive users.
    p_positive = float(parameters["p_positive"])
    valence_draw = float(parameters["valence_draw"])
    sign = 1.0 if valence_draw < p_positive else -1.0

    # Signed validity-weighted additive score: score_i = sum_j s_i * v_j^gamma * (A_j - B_j),
    # plus a small softmax response intercept toward A.
    weighted_diff = float(np.dot(v ** gamma, a - b))
    score_a = sign * weighted_diff + bias_a

    # Numerically stable sigmoid for p(A | score).
    z = beta * score_a
    if z >= 0.0:
        p_a_core = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-z))
    else:
        ez = np.exp(z)
        p_a_core = ez / (1.0 + ez)

    # Uniform lapse over the two options.
    p_a = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_a_core + epsilon / 2.0
    p_a = float(np.clip(p_a, 0.0, 1.0))
    return np.array([p_a, 1.0 - p_a], dtype=float)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    p = np.asarray(probs, dtype=float)
    p = p / p.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(p), p=p))


`parameters`:
- p_positive: [0.06, 0.16]
- valence_draw: [0.0, 1.0]
- gamma: [1.9, 2.5]
- beta: [1.4, 2.6]
- epsilon: [0.08, 0.20]
- bias_a: [0.03, 0.18]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: The previous pi_2 tallying model ignored the communicated validity information entirely, which forced its predictions toward approximately zero or the wrong sign on several validity-dependent metrics. The previous negative-only pi_3 model captured the dominant contra-indicator pattern but was too sharp because it forced every subject to use one fixed negative-weight rule. The proposed theory keeps the validity-weighted additive computation that gives pi_3 its aggregate anti-tally and anti-TTB signs, but introduces subject-level valence heterogeneity: most subjects keep a negative validity weighting, while a minority switch to positive-valence trust. A small softmax bias and subject-varying gamma, beta, and lapse further flex the signed weighting away from deterministic fixed-form rules. This reproduces larger per-subject variance and should moderate the extreme positive metric in Experiment 3 without destroying the negative aggregate effects in Experiments 1 and 2.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a clear qualitative improvement: it is the only model in the comparison set that gets all four metric signs correct, and it sits between the too-sharp pi3 negative-weight theory and the validity-blind pi2 tallying theory. However, the magnitudes remain systematically miscalibrated. Exp1: candidate -0.300 vs real -0.432, under-shooting the anti-tally effect by about 0.13. Exp2: candidate -0.155 vs real -0.265, under-shooting the anti-TTB effect by about 0.11, and the between-subject variance is far too small (0.012 vs 0.071). Exp3: candidate 0.523 vs real 0.362, still overshooting by about 0.16, and variance is too large (0.220 vs 0.098). Exp4: candidate 0.412 vs real 0.530, again under-shooting by about 0.12. This pattern suggests the current single subject-level sign mixture is not the right heterogeneity structure: the positive minority weakens Exp1, Exp2, and Exp4 too much relative to real behavior, while it does not weaken Exp3 enough. The variance mismatch also indicates the all-or-none sign flip creates bimodal behavior in Exp3 but too little continuous heterogeneity in Exp2.
Rationale: Keep the heterogeneous signed-validity weighting family, but refine the instantiation with in-family changes. First, replace the single fixed per-subject sign with cue-specific signed weights or a continuous signed-weight distribution, e.g. draw s_ij per subject and cue with high-validity cues mostly negative and low-validity cues closer to zero or occasionally positive. This should avoid whole-subject sign flipping and bring Exp2 variance up while reducing the over-dispersion in Exp3. Second, add diminishing returns or saturation when several same-direction validity-weighted cues accumulate, for example score = sign * tanh(k * sum_j v_j^gamma * (A_j - B_j)), or apply a cue-rank discount. This would pull the Exp3 prediction from 0.523 down toward 0.362 without weakening the smaller one- and two-cue effects in Exp1, Exp2, and Exp4. Third, rebalance noise and bias: reduce epsilon toward roughly 0.02-0.08 and/or use a higher inverse temperature for the negative-valence component so Exp1, Exp2, and Exp4 are less regressed toward chance; reduce bias_a toward 0.00-0.05. Do not globally raise p_positive, because that would further weaken the already under-shot Exp1, Exp2, and Exp4 effects. These are parameter and functional-form adjustments within the prescribed signed-validity family, not a change of mechanism.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1103 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
