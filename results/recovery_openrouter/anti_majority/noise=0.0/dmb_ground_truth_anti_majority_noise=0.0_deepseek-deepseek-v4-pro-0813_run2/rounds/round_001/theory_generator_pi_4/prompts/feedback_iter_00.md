# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace pi_2 with a heterogeneous signed-validity weighting theory. The new theory should state that people weight binary feature differences by communicated validity, but the sign of the weighting is not uniform: a majority use the negative-valence/contra-indicator rule captured by pi_3, while a minority use positive-valence trust or near-equal tallying. Its predict function should compute score_i = sum_j s_i * v_j^gamma * (A_j - B_j) with softmax noise and lapse, where s_i is a subject-level valence sign or a cue-specific sign drawn from a latent strategy distribution, and gamma/beta vary across subjects. This should preserve the aggregate anti-tally/anti-TTB signs and close magnitudes seen in Exp3 and Exp4, while attenuating the overly sharp Exp1 prediction toward the observed 0.36 and reproducing the large per-subject variance. It differs from pi_2 because validities are used explicitly and equal tallying is only a special boundary; it differs from pi_3 by adding valence and strategy heterogeneity rather than a single fixed negative-weight rule.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People integrate binary expert-rating differences by weighting each feature difference by its communicated validity raised to a subject-specific power, but the sign of that validity weighting is heterogeneous across subjects. A majority of subjects adopt a negative-valence or contra-indicator rule: a feature advantage is treated as evidence against the product, with stronger validities receiving larger absolute weight. A minority of subjects instead use positive-valence trust: a feature advantage is treated as evidence favoring the product. Near-equal tallying is the boundary case of the model when validity weighting is effectively flat or when a subject's signed weighting is very small. The choice probability is produced by a softmax over the signed validity-weighted difference plus a small A-response bias, followed by a uniform lapse. Gamma, inverse temperature, bias, and lapse vary across subjects, producing the large between-subject variance observed in the data while preserving the aggregate negative-valence pattern.

- beta: [1.4, 2.6]
- epsilon: [0.08, 0.20]
- bias_a: [0.03, 0.18]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
The previous pi_2 tallying model ignored the communicated validity information entirely, which forced its predictions toward approximately zero or the wrong sign on several validity-dependent metrics. The previous negative-only pi_3 model captured the dominant contra-indicator pattern but was too sharp because it forced every subject to use one fixed negative-weight rule. The proposed theory keeps the validity-weighted additive computation that gives pi_3 its aggregate anti-tally and anti-TTB signs, but introduces subject-level valence heterogeneity: most subjects keep a negative validity weighting, while a minority switch to positive-valence trust. A small softmax bias and subject-varying gamma, beta, and lapse further flex the signed weighting away from deterministic fixed-form rules. This reproduces larger per-subject variance and should moderate the extreme positive metric in Experiment 3 without destroying the negative aggregate effects in Experiments 1 and 2.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1103 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1103.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is a clear qualitative improvement: it is the only model in the comparison set that gets all four metric signs correct, and it sits between the too-sharp pi3 negative-weight theory and the validity-blind pi2 tallying theory. However, the magnitudes remain systematically miscalibrated. Exp1: candidate -0.300 vs real -0.432, under-shooting the anti-tally effect by about 0.13. Exp2: candidate -0.155 vs real -0.265, under-shooting the anti-TTB effect by about 0.11, and the between-subject variance is far too small (0.012 vs 0.071). Exp3: candidate 0.523 vs real 0.362, still overshooting by about 0.16, and variance is too large (0.220 vs 0.098). Exp4: candidate 0.412 vs real 0.530, again under-shooting by about 0.12. This pattern suggests the current single subject-level sign mixture is not the right heterogeneity structure: the positive minority weakens Exp1, Exp2, and Exp4 too much relative to real behavior, while it does not weaken Exp3 enough. The variance mismatch also indicates the all-or-none sign flip creates bimodal behavior in Exp3 but too little continuous heterogeneity in Exp2.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the heterogeneous signed-validity weighting family, but refine the instantiation with in-family changes. First, replace the single fixed per-subject sign with cue-specific signed weights or a continuous signed-weight distribution, e.g. draw s_ij per subject and cue with high-validity cues mostly negative and low-validity cues closer to zero or occasionally positive. This should avoid whole-subject sign flipping and bring Exp2 variance up while reducing the over-dispersion in Exp3. Second, add diminishing returns or saturation when several same-direction validity-weighted cues accumulate, for example score = sign * tanh(k * sum_j v_j^gamma * (A_j - B_j)), or apply a cue-rank discount. This would pull the Exp3 prediction from 0.523 down toward 0.362 without weakening the smaller one- and two-cue effects in Exp1, Exp2, and Exp4. Third, rebalance noise and bias: reduce epsilon toward roughly 0.02-0.08 and/or use a higher inverse temperature for the negative-valence component so Exp1, Exp2, and Exp4 are less regressed toward chance; reduce bias_a toward 0.00-0.05. Do not globally raise p_positive, because that would further weaken the already under-shot Exp1, Exp2, and Exp4 effects. These are parameter and functional-form adjustments within the prescribed signed-validity family, not a change of mechanism."
