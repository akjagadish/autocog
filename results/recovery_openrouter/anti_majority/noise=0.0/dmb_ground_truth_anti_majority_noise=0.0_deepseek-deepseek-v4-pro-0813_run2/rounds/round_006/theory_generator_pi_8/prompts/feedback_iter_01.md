# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_7_1`).

Replace THEORY 1 with a conflict-modulated continuous anti-validity theory. Keep a mostly negative subject-level sign and a continuous validity-weighted difference D = sum_j v_j ** gamma_i * (A_j - B_j), but do not impose a fixed threshold and do not use one fixed half-saturation constant. Use an evidence-gated response such as S_i = -lambda_i * G(C) * D / (kappa_i + abs(D) + r_i) + bias_i + w_t * T, where G(C) is a subject-level gain that is large when D is concentrated in one or a few high-validity experts and small when D comes from many low-validity or mutually conflicting experts. C can be an inverse-validity weighted count of disagreeing features or the largest single feature contribution divided by abs(D). A small tally or configural term T = (1/n) * sum_j (A_j - B_j) with a sign-dependent weight should also be included to handle count-driven designs. This theory differs from THEORY 1 by having no dead zone, and differs from THEORY 2 by making gain and saturation depend on conflict structure rather than a fixed tau. The resulting shape can give a strong low-D gradient in the one-hot staircase of Experiment 2, a very negative high-minus-2-low-gap statistic in Experiment 1, and near-zero low-D contrast in the jumbled conflict design of Experiment 14.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Conflict-modulated continuous anti-validity with concentration-based conflict gain (CMCAV-c). Subjects form a continuous validity-weighted difference D = sum_j v_j^gamma_i * (A_j - B_j), mostly apply a negative validity-weighting sign, and respond through an evidence-gated continuous response S_i = -lambda_i * G(C) * D / (kappa_i + abs(D) + r_i) + bias_i + w_t * T. The gate has no fixed threshold and no single fixed half-saturation constant. Instead, G(C) is driven by a concentration-style conflict measure: the dominant validity-weighted contribution's share of total magnitude, strongly penalized when many comparable contributions exist, with a small residual net-coherence exponent so broad but internally consistent count-based evidence is not fully suppressed. A small sign-dependent tally term T = (1/n) * sum_j (A_j - B_j) reinforces count-driven designs where D and T move together.

`rationale`:
This is a targeted calibration within the prescribed conflict-modulated continuous anti-validity family. The previous CMCAV version had kappa too large and the conflict gain too weakly differentiated between concentrated one-hot/few-feature evidence and broad jumbled conflict. Here kappa and r are lowered and lambda is raised, strengthening small-|D| contrasts in one-hot staircase and few-feature orientation designs. The gain C is replaced with a concentration-style measure (max_m / M)^conc_exp: it stays large for concentrated one-hot evidence but is strongly suppressed by a breadth penalty (1 + rho * max(0, n_disc-2)^eta) when many comparable validity-weighted contributions exist. A small residual coherence exponent xi (reduced from the previous large xi) keeps broad but internally consistent evidence responsive without re-introducing the severe near-cancellation penalty that hurt Experiments 13 and 14. The validity dominance boost nu is reduced so high-validity concentrated evidence does not push high-|D| orientation gaps too steeply relative to low-|D| gaps. Finally, the small sign-dependent tally weights are made negative so that T reinforces, rather than partially cancels, the anti-validity count-driven gradient in designs such as Experiment 1. No fixed threshold, no fixed half-saturation constant, and no dead zone are introduced; the model remains continuous and probabilistic.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1601 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1264 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1264.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: CMCAV is faithful to the prescribed mechanism family: it keeps a mostly negative subject-level sign, uses a continuous validity-weighted difference D = sum_j v_j**gamma_i * (A_j - B_j), has no fixed threshold and no single fixed half-saturation constant, uses a conflict-gated gain, and adds a small sign-dependent tally term. It performs well on several experiments: Experiment 2 is close (-0.209 vs -0.265), Experiment 3 is close (0.438 vs 0.362), Experiment 5 nearly matches (-0.015 vs -0.030), Experiments 7, 8, and 11 are close, and Experiment 4 is in the right direction though somewhat weak. However the most diagnostic contrast experiments are not well calibrated. Experiment 1 gives only -0.204 against a real -0.432, so the anti-validity gap is under half the empirical size. Experiment 13 gives -0.153 against -0.513, meaning the model does not produce enough orientation contrast at small absolute validity-weighted differences. Experiment 14 gives 0.159 against 0.389, so the low-|D| one-hot contrast is too weak. Conversely, Experiment 12 gives 0.170 against 0.036, so broad jumbled small-|D| responding is far too strong. Experiment 9 is also too weak (0.442 vs 0.601), and Experiment 10 has a sign mismatch, though its magnitude is small. The pattern indicates that the conflict gate and saturation divisor are not yet differentiating concentrated few-feature evidence from broad multi-feature conflict strongly enough.
Rationale: Regenerate within the same conflict-modulated continuous anti-validity family, with targeted calibration rather than a redesign. First, strengthen the low-|D| response in concentrated one-hot or few-feature designs by lowering kappa and r, for example kappa in [0.04, 0.12] and r in [0.0, 0.02], and possibly raise lam to [1.2, 2.2]. This directly targets Experiments 1, 9, 13, and 14 where the real data show stronger small-evidence contrasts. Second, revise the gain G(C) so it suppresses broad multi-feature mutual conflict without suppressing near-canceling one-hot pairs. The current C multiplies the largest contribution ratio by coherence**xi, which penalizes cases where a few large opposite contributions nearly cancel, yet the breadth penalty is too weak for Experiments 12. Use a concentration-style conflict measure, such as max_m / M with a stronger penalty for many comparable contributions, and reduce or remove the net-coherence exponent xi; this should raise Experiment 14 while lowering Experiment 12. Third, to approach Experiment 13, reduce the positive dominance validity boost nu or make the gain saturate for high-validity concentrated evidence, so high-|D| cases do not produce overly steep orientation gaps relative to low-|D| cases. Keep the mostly negative sign and the small tally term, since the negative-sign structure is well supported by Experiments 2, 9, and 14. Do not reintroduce a fixed threshold or fixed tau and do not switch to a different mechanism family.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1601 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1264 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "The candidate is faithful to the prescribed conflict-modulated continuous anti-validity family and improves several experiments: Experiment 2 is nearly exact (-0.2642 vs -0.2650), Experiment 6 (0.0154 vs 0.0117), Experiment 7 (0.0012 vs 0.0064), Experiment 11 (0.2695 vs 0.3030), and Experiment 14 (0.3667 vs 0.3889) all match well. However the most diagnostic conflict-structure results remain badly miscalibrated. Experiment 1 gives -0.0678 against a real -0.4323, so the strong count-driven anti-validity gradient has largely disappeared from an already weak iter-1 value of -0.2039. Experiment 13 gives -0.1517 against -0.5133, meaning small-abs(D) orientation contrast is still too weak. Experiment 12 gives 0.0778 against 0.0356, so broad jumbled low-validity differences are still over-weighted. Experiments 3, 4, and 9 are directionally correct but too weak, and Experiments 5 and 10 have small sign mismatches. The main mechanistic problem appears to be the raw breadth penalty on n_disc: it suppresses any disagreement count equally, even when a few high-validity features dominate (Experiment 1), while remaining too weak for many comparable low-validity contributors (Experiment 12). In addition, the sign(D)-conditional tally weight can partially cancel rather than reinforce the anti-validity gradient when D and T have opposite signs, which likely explains the Experiment 1 regression from the previous iteration.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Regenerate within the same family, with targeted calibration rather than a different mechanism. First, replace the raw disagreement-count breadth penalty with an inverse-validity weighted conflict count, as the arbitration recommendation suggested: penalize only low-validity opposing contributions, for example via a term like sum over features opposing sign(D) of (1 - v_j)^eta_conf, rather than penalizing n_disc directly. This should preserve strong responding in Experiments 1, 3, and 9 while further suppressing the broad jumbled conflict in Experiment 12. Second, remove the sign(D)-conditional tally cancellation: use a single negative tally weight in roughly [-0.35, -0.15] chosen by sign(T) or independent of D, so T always acts against count-based validity direction. Third, after that conflict reweighting is installed, modestly reduce kappa to about [0.02, 0.06] and raise g_range to about [2.5, 3.2] to strengthen small-abs(D) orientation gaps in Experiment 13 and one-hot contrast in Experiment 9 without reintroducing a dead zone. Do not add any fixed threshold or fixed half-saturation constant, and keep the mostly negative subject-level sign and continuous probabilistic response."
