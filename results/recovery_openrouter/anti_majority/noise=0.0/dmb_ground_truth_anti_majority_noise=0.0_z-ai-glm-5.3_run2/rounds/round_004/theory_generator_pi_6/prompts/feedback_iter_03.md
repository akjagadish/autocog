# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace HEAI (pi_5) with a context-referenced, trait-free anti-validity theory. Sketch — Context-Normalized Noisy Anti-Validity Integration (CNNAI): (1) Keep the empirically well-supported core shared by both theories: all cues integrated additively into a per-option value, a rating of 1 is a defect (sign inversion), softmax plus symmetric lapse, a modest guesser subpopulation. (2) Replace the stable per-subject weight map (whether SCWI's fixed tau or HEAI's lifetime gamma) with a CONTEXT-REFERENCED weight: w_j = -v_j * (v_j / v_ref)^eta, where v_ref is the mean/max validity of the cues actually displayed in the current trial set (or block) and eta is an elasticity that is RE-DRAWN per context/block from a broad unimodal distribution centered near 0.3–0.6 (roughly lognormal, wide). Because eta is redrawn when the validity context changes (e.g., between the 0.50-ladder and 0.60-ladder of Exp 1), the theory predicts cross-ladder consistency near r ≈ 0.15–0.25 — matching the observed 0.196 — while still producing strong within-context anti-validity behavior (negative Exp-3 slope, low Exp-6 tally-following). Range normalization also naturally produces intermediate psychometric rises (Exp 2's D ≈ 0.25–0.35) because the effective weight ratio compresses toward the context's validity spread rather than following a fixed power law. (3) Add per-trial multiplicative attention noise on cue weights (not fixed per-cue attention), which inflates between-subject variance on diagnostic composites toward the observed 0.06–0.09 without shifting means — fixing the systematic variance underprediction of both current theories. (4) Retain a heterogeneous beta/epsilon mixture but let it be uncorrelated with eta, so no latent trait couples behavior across contexts. This theory is a stronger competitor to SCWI than HEAI because it keeps SCWI's empirically successful anti-validity integration while explaining the two things SCWI gets wrong: near-zero cross-context consistency and elevated between-subject variance. It differs from both predecessors precisely where they were falsified: neither a fixed quadratic map nor a fixed power-law trait, but a context-normalized, redrawn-per-context gradient with per-trial attention diffusion.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Context-Normalized Noisy Anti-Validity Integration (CNNAI), right-skewed ladder elasticity with max-referenced normalization. Subjects integrate all binary expert ratings additively into a per-option value, but a rating of 1 is comprehended as a DEFECT (sign inversion). The anti-weight of expert j is context-normalized, w_j = -v_j * (v_j / v_ref)^eta, where v_ref is the MAXIMUM instructed validity among the cues endorsed on the current trial and eta is a per-context elasticity. The context is the validity ladder: eta is redrawn per (subject, distinct-validity-set-of-endorsed-cues), so all cells sharing a ladder inherit one shared per-subject draw while different ladders draw independently. The per-context redraw is RIGHT-SKEWED (lognormal, strictly positive, median ~0.16): almost no engaged subject falls into the flat/tolerant region below eta ~ 0.1, while a heavy upper tail (eta up to ~1-2) supplies the steep, near-lexicographic anti-validity behavior that the Exp-2 dissociation and the Exp-10 psychometric rise demand. The stable cross-context component is small (sd 0.13 around 0.08), so cross-ladder consistency stays near r ~ 0.2. Engaged inverse temperature is nearly homogeneous (lognormal sd 0.25, median ~2.9), per-trial multiplicative attention diffusion (sd 0.14) supplies within-context stochasticity, and choice is softmax(beta * values) plus a symmetric lapse epsilon with a 13% true-guesser subpopulation uncorrelated with eta.

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # Context-Normalized Noisy Anti-Validity Integration (CNNAI),
    # iter 4 -- minimal-diff recalibration of the accepted iter-3 base
    # per the iter-3 critic diagnosis. Mechanism family UNCHANGED:
    # additive anti-validity integration, ladder-pooled context key,
    # per-trial attention diffusion, softmax + symmetric lapse,
    # guesser mixture. Changes:
    #   (A) v_ref SWITCHED from MEAN to MAX of the endorsed cues'
    #       validities (the arbiter sketch's 'mean/max' option, as the
    #       critic prescribed). Note the sign structure (which option
    # wins) is invariant to v_ref -- only the evidence SCALE changes
    # slightly -- so this is a safe in-family normalization swap.
    #   (B) ETA DECOMPOSITION REBALANCED AND RIGHT-SKEWED: the
    #       per-ladder redraw is now a LOGNORMAL (strictly positive,
    #       median 0.16, log-sd 1.05 -> sd ~0.21) added to a small
    #       stable normal component (center 0.08, sd 0.13). This does
    #       three things at once: (i) almost no engaged mass sits in
    #       the flat region below eta ~ 0.1 (the critic's right-skew
    #       prescription), so the diagnostic composites stop being
    #       diluted by validity-tolerant subjects; (ii) the heavy
    #       upper tail supplies the steep anti-validity behavior the
    #       Exp-2 dissociation and Exp-10 rise need; (iii) cutting the
    #       redraw sd from 0.60 to ~0.21 while raising the stable sd
    #       from 0.10 to 0.13 fixes BOTH Exp-9 problems -- the
    #       exploded cross-ladder variance (0.163 -> toward 0.06) and
    #       the low r point estimate (stable/ctx variance ratio now
    #       ~0.19, yielding latent r ~ 0.2).
    #   (C) The overall eta center lands at ~0.24 (median), NOT the
    #       0.35-0.40 the critic sketched: the kill composites of Exps
    #       5/6/8 are threshold statistics F(eta < 0.31-0.34), and the
    #       real values (0.60-0.68) pin F(0.33) at ~0.62-0.71, which a
    #       0.35-0.40 center (F ~ 0.45) would undershoot. The right
    #       skew supplies the steep upper tail instead of a high center.
    #   (D) Engaged beta median raised 2.4 -> ~2.9 (NOT trimmed): with
    #       the eta bulk pinned below the kill knives, sharpening the
    #       eta->choice map is what converts the F targets into the
    #       composite means AND the between-subject variance (subjects
    #       straddling the transition region). Attention diffusion
    #       trimmed 0.18 -> 0.14 for the same reason.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal-diff edit of the accepted iter-3 CNNAI base implementing the iter-3 critic's structural prescriptions, with one deliberate numeric deviation that I justify below. (A) MAX-REFERENCED NORMALIZATION: v_ref is switched from the mean to the max endorsed validity, exactly as the critic prescribed (the arbiter sketch allowed mean/max). Analytically this is a safe swap: the option-preference signs are invariant to v_ref (the ratio w_h/w_l = (v_h/v_l)^(1+eta) does not contain v_ref), so only the evidence scale moves slightly. (B) REBALANCED, RIGHT-SKEWED ETA: the per-ladder redraw is now a lognormal increment (median 0.16, log-sd 1.05, sd ~0.21) on top of a small stable normal component (center 0.08, sd 0.13). This implements the critic's (B) and (C) simultaneously: the redraw sd drops 0.60 -> ~0.21, which shrinks the cross-ladder flip-flopping that blew up Exp 9's variance (0.163 -> toward the real 0.06) and raises the stable component's relative share enough to lift Exp 9's r toward 0.196 (latent coupling = 0.13^2/(0.13^2+0.21^2) ~ 0.19); and the strictly positive, right-skewed shape removes the ~35% of engaged mass that previously drew flat or validity-tolerant weights (eta < 0.1), which was diluting every steepness composite, while the heavy upper tail (eta up to ~2) supplies the steep anti-validity behavior that Exp 2's dissociation and Exp 10's psychometric rise require. (C) THE ONE DEVIATION -- ETA CENTER ~0.24, NOT 0.35-0.40: the kill composites of Exps 5/6/8 are threshold statistics F(eta < knife) with knives at 0.31-0.34, and iter 3 confirmed the near-linear mapping composite ~ 0.065 + 0.87*F(knife). The real values (0.604/0.630/0.684) pin F(0.33) at 0.62-0.71; a 0.35-0.40 center gives F(0.33) ~ 0.45 and would push all three composites DOWN toward 0.45-0.50, the opposite of what the critic wants to fix. The right-skewed lognormal achieves the critic's goal (more mass above the per-cell kill knives for Exps 2/10, little mass below 0.1) while keeping the bulk below the 0.31-0.34 knives that Exps 5/6/8 demand. (D) SHARPENING: engaged beta median 2.4 -> ~2.9 and attention diffusion 0.18 -> 0.14. With the eta bulk pinned below the knives, the residual composite gap is softness of the eta->choice map; sharpening it raises the Exps 5/6/7/8 means AND the between-subject variance (subjects straddling the transition region, per the critic's iter-3 variance logic). I monitor the guardrails: Exps 1/3 may steepen slightly (-0.185 -> ~-0.19; 0.138 -> ~0.145) and Exp 4 may dip ~0.015 -- a combined cost of ~0.03 against expected gains of 0.05-0.12 on each of Exps 2/5/6/7/8/10 and the Exp 9 variance repair. Everything else -- the additive anti-validity core, the ladder-pooled context key, the softmax/lapse structure, the 13% guesser mixture, the parameter set -- is byte-identical to the accepted base.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1070 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1032 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0968 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1234 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0968.

    margin D = sum_j u_j * (b_j - a_j), with u_j = v_j + tau * v_j^2
    (tau fixed at 0.35, the midpoint of SCWI's tau range).

    D > 0 means option A carries fewer/smaller anti-validity 'defects'
    and is therefore preferred by SCWI. SCWI predicts a POSITIVE slope
    (~0.2-0.3 with beta in [1.1,1.7], epsilon in [0.05,0.15]).
    Tallying cannot produce a positive slope: on count-tied trials
    (pairs 1-8, 24) it outputs exactly 0.5 for any beta/epsilon, and on
    all remaining trials its choice probability tracks the raw count
    margin, which is strongly ANTI-correlated with D across this design
    (the tally winner is almost always the weighted-margin loser). So
    Tallying's slope is <= 0 (approximately 0 for small beta, clearly
    negative for large beta). The sign separation is parameter-free.

    # Kill-composite: fraction of choices falling on the HIGH-validity stack
    # across the parameter-free sign-kill trials of this design.
    #
    # Kill trials pit a endorsements on higher-validity cues against b
    # endorsements on lower-validity cues (all other cues 0 for both
    # options, disjoint supports, each stack within one validity block)
    # at count ratios that lie strictly between the two theories'
    # weight-ratio windows:
    #   5 x 0.90 vs 7 x 0.70   (r = 1.40)
    #   9 x 0.70 vs 14 x 0.50  (r = 1.556)
    #   5 x 0.90 vs 11 x 0.50  (r = 2.20)
    # SCWI's ratio window w(v_h)/w(v_l) is BELOW each r for every admissible
    # tau, so SCWI always prefers the high-validity stack. PAHI's power-law
    # window is ABOVE each r for every admissible gamma, so PAHI always
    # prefers the low-validity stack. The metric is the fraction of kill
    # trials on which the subject chose the high-validity stack; mirrored
    # versions of each kill pair absorb side bias. It is well defined on
    # the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject slice (18 kill trials

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed CNNAI family (additive anti-validity integration, context-referenced elasticity, per-trial attention diffusion, guesser mixture) and its aggregate loss (0.1070) made it the accepted base. Per-experiment, however, there is a clear and systematic pattern of residual error rather than random noise. (1) The headline mechanism — near-zero cross-context consistency — FAILS: Exp 9 cross-ladder r = 0.441 vs real 0.196, worse than plain SCWI (pi_3: 0.239). Diagnosis: the subject-level ladder composites sL and sM average over many cells, so the per-cell context redraw (sd 0.36) averages out within each ladder, leaving the STABLE per-subject components (eta_base sd 0.25, and especially the heterogeneous beta with lognormal sd 0.45) to dominate between-subject differences. Stable beta is a hidden trait: high-beta subjects are more extreme on BOTH ladders, producing spurious cross-ladder correlation even with independent etas. (2) Between-subject variances are systematically underpredicted by roughly a factor of 2 on the diagnostic composites: Exp 2 var 0.025 vs 0.093, Exp 5 0.031 vs 0.064, Exp 6 0.033 vs 0.070, Exp 8 0.033 vs 0.065. The per-trial attention diffusion (sd 0.15) is too weak, and the averaging-out of per-cell eta draws suppresses exactly the variance the redraw was supposed to create. (3) The anti-validity steepness composites all undershoot in the same direction: Exp 2 (0.186 vs 0.274), Exp 5 (0.600 vs 0.684), Exp 6 (0.580 vs 0.630), Exp 7 (0.557 vs 0.646), Exp 10 rise (0.199 vs 0.296). The proposer deliberately centered eta at 0.19, below the kill-knife at ~0.31–0.34; the real data want more probability mass above the knife. Exps 1, 3, 4, 8 are essentially on target (slopes/composites within 0.01–0.03 of real), confirming the shared anti-validity core is sound.
Rationale: Regenerate, staying strictly inside the CNNAI family, with three targeted recalibrations. (A) Break the hidden cross-ladder coupling: shrink the stable elasticity component (eta_base sd 0.25 → ~0.10) and enlarge the per-context redraw (sd 0.36 → ~0.50), AND narrow the engaged beta distribution (lognormal sd 0.45 → ~0.25, or cap beta heterogeneity) so stable response extremity no longer correlates the two ladders. This should pull Exp 9 from 0.44 toward the observed 0.196 without touching the anti-validity core. (B) Restore between-subject variance: raise the per-trial attention diffusion (sd 0.15 → ~0.30) and/or let epsilon vary more across engaged subjects; the composites need var ≈ 0.06–0.09, not 0.03. Note the tension and its resolution: increasing per-context eta spread raises within-context variance while LOWERING cross-context correlation — both desired — whereas the current parameterization does neither because the context noise averages out over cells. (C) Shift the eta center modestly upward (0.19 → ~0.25–0.28, still below the 0.31–0.34 knife) so more contexts sit above the kill flip, lifting Exps 2/5/6/7 and the Exp 10 rise toward their real values while keeping enough mass below gamma = 1 for the twin cells. Watch Exp 3 (already slightly high at 0.139 vs 0.123) and Exp 1 slope as guardrails; if they overshoot, compensate by trimming the guesser fraction slightly (16% → ~13%) rather than reversing the eta shift. All changes are parameter recalibrations within the prescribed mechanism — no family switch needed.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1070 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1032 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-2 recalibration did exactly what my iter-1 critique asked on its primary target, and the gate accepted it (loss 0.1070 -> 0.1032). Exp 9 cross-ladder r moved from 0.441 to 0.164 (real 0.196) — the headline CNNAI prediction of near-zero cross-context consistency is now essentially on target, and Exp 4 improved to within 0.01 of real. The narrowed beta, tiny stable eta component, and trimmed guesser fraction should be kept. However, the rest of the profile regressed or stagnated, and the pattern is diagnostic rather than noisy. (1) All anti-validity steepness composites UNDERSHOOT and got worse or flat vs iter 1: Exp 2 0.139 vs real 0.274 (error grew from -0.088 to -0.134), Exp 5 0.553 vs 0.684, Exp 6 0.523 vs 0.630, Exp 7 0.551 vs 0.646, Exp 8 0.558 vs 0.604, Exp 10 rise 0.199 vs 0.296 (unchanged despite the eta center moving 0.19 -> 0.26). (2) Between-subject variances got WORSE despite doubling the attention diffusion: Exp 5 var 0.031 -> 0.019 (real 0.064), Exp 6 0.033 -> 0.014 (real 0.070), Exp 2 stuck at 0.025 (real 0.093), Exp 8 0.030 (real 0.065). My iter-1 part-(B) prescription (inflate variance via per-trial diffusion) was wrong in mechanism, and I withdraw it: per-trial multiplicative noise is independent across trials, so it averages out within a subject's composite — it adds within-subject binomial-like noise, not between-subject dispersion. The same averaging-out logic dooms the steepness composites: the candidate redraws eta per endorsed-cue INDEX set, so each subject's composite averages over ~10-20 independent per-cell eta draws (many of which land near or below the kill knife, flipping or flattening individual cells), concentrating every subject near the population mean. This single design choice — per-cell context hashing — explains both failures simultaneously: diluted mean steepness AND suppressed between-subject variance, and it is also a drift from the arbiter sketch, which specified eta redrawn 'per context/block (e.g., between the 0.50-ladder and 0.60-ladder of Exp 1)', i.e., at the ladder/block level, not per trial cell.
Rationale: Regenerate, staying strictly inside the CNNAI family, with one structural recalibration plus parameter retuning. (A) COARSEN THE CONTEXT KEY: replace the hash over the endorsed-cue index set with a hash over the sorted set of distinct VALIDITY VALUES among the endorsed cues (equivalently, a bucketed v_ref / ladder identifier). All cells within one validity ladder then share a single per-subject eta draw: high-eta subjects are steep on every cell of that ladder, low-eta subjects shallow on every cell — restoring both the mean steepness composites (Exps 2/5/6/7/8/10) and the between-subject variance (target 0.06-0.09) in one move, because the composite is now driven by one shared draw instead of an average of many. Different ladders (Exp 9's {1.00,0.50} vs {1.00,0.60} cells; Exp 10's two ladders) remain distinct contexts, so cross-ladder decoupling and the hard-won Exp 9 r ~ 0.16-0.20 are preserved. (B) RETUNE: since pooling removes the dilution, keep the eta center at ~0.26 — do NOT raise it further; Exp 1 slope (-0.181 vs -0.175) and Exp 3 (0.145 vs 0.123) are already slightly steep and will steepen more under pooling, so be ready to trim the center toward ~0.22 if those guardrails overshoot. Reduce the per-trial attention diffusion back to sd ~0.15-0.20: at 0.30 it flattens psychometric composites (a contributor to the Exp 2 undershoot) and, as established, cannot create between-subject variance anyway. Keep the iter-2 constants that worked: narrow engaged beta (lognormal sd 0.25, clip [1,5]), tiny stable eta_base sd 0.10, 13% guessers, widened epsilon. (C) Verify against the variance targets explicitly: Exp 2 var 0.093, Exp 5 0.064, Exp 6 0.070, Exp 8 0.065 — if the shared-per-ladder eta still underdelivers, widen the per-context redraw sd (0.50 -> 0.60-0.70) rather than re-inflating beta or eta_base, since those were the coupling channels that broke Exp 9 in iter 1. All changes are within the prescribed CNNAI mechanism; no family switch.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1032 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0968 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-3 candidate faithfully implements the prescribed CNNAI family, and the ladder-pooled context key I recommended in iter 2 did what it was supposed to do partially: loss improved again (0.1032 -> 0.0968), Exp 2's mean moved substantially toward target (0.139 -> 0.208 vs real 0.274), Exp 4 is essentially perfect (0.166 vs 0.163), and Exps 1/3 remain close. The ladder pooling stays. But the residual error pattern is still systematic, and this iteration reveals that the single remaining free knob — the eta dispersion — is now miscalibrated in BOTH directions at once, which is diagnostic of a deeper placement problem. (1) Steepness composites still undershoot across the board: Exp 5 0.569 vs 0.684, Exp 6 0.538 vs 0.630, Exp 7 0.566 vs 0.646, Exp 8 0.554 vs 0.604, Exp 10 rise 0.173 vs 0.296 (which actually got WORSE than iter 2's 0.199). The likely root cause is that the eta->behavior map is too FLAT: v_ref is the MEAN validity of endorsed cues, so the ratios v_j/v_ref sit close to 1 and even large eta draws produce only mildly discriminating weight profiles; meanwhile roughly a third of the engaged mass (center 0.23, sd 0.60) draws eta < 0, i.e. flat or validity-tolerant weights that actively dilute every steepness composite. (2) Between-subject variance is now wrong in opposite directions simultaneously: Exp 9 var exploded to 0.163 vs real 0.060 (the sd-0.60 per-ladder redraw makes subjects flip-flop steepness between the 0.50- and 0.60-ladders far more than real subjects do), while Exps 2/5/6/10 var remain 2-4x UNDER target (0.017-0.028 vs 0.064-0.093). A single sd knob cannot fix both — the variance is in the wrong place: too much cross-ladder inconsistency, too little within-ladder dispersion around a steep mean. (3) Exp 9's point estimate drifted low (0.134 vs 0.196) because the stable eta_base component (sd 0.10) is now dwarfed by the widened redraw. The mechanism family is sound and clearly the best-fitting theory so far (compare pi_3_1 and pi_5 rows); what fails is the placement and shape of the eta distribution and the strength of the normalization.
Rationale: Verdict: regenerate, staying strictly inside CNNAI, building on the accepted iter-3 base (keep the ladder-pooled context key, narrow beta sd 0.25, 13% guessers, attention diffusion 0.18 — all validated). Three coordinated recalibrations: (A) STEEPEN THE EFFECTIVE WEIGHT MAP. Switch v_ref from the mean to the MAX validity of the endorsed cues (the arbiter sketch explicitly allowed 'mean/max', so this is an in-family normalization swap), and/or raise the eta center from 0.23 to ~0.35-0.40. Mean-referencing compresses v_j/v_ref toward 1, which is why three iterations of eta tuning have barely moved Exps 5/6/7/10; max-referencing makes low-validity ratios substantially below 1, so moderate eta now produces genuinely SCWI-like discrimination. This is the primary lever for the undershooting means. (B) REBALANCE THE ETA DECOMPOSITION — this is not oscillation on the sd knob but a change of strategy: cut the per-context redraw sd from 0.60 to ~0.30-0.35 AND raise the stable eta_base sd from 0.10 to ~0.15. This simultaneously (i) shrinks the cross-ladder flip-flopping that blew up Exp 9's variance (0.163 -> toward 0.060), (ii) lifts Exp 9's point estimate toward 0.196 by strengthening the stable component's relative share, and (iii) — together with (A) — concentrates subjects across the per-cell kill knives so that composite between-subject variance on Exps 5/6 rises toward 0.064-0.070 (variance comes from subjects straddling the transition region, not from saturated extremes spread over two ladders). Aim for sigma_ctx roughly 2x sigma_base, which yields cross-ladder r near the observed 0.2 by construction. (C) RIGHT-SKEW THE ETA DISTRIBUTION: replace the symmetric normal redraw with a lognormal-like shape (as the arbiter sketch actually specified) so that little engaged mass falls below eta ~ 0.1 — the currently ~35% flat-weight subjects dilute the Exp 2 mean/variance and the Exp 5/6/7 composites. For Exp 2's large real variance (0.093), the right tail (strongly anti-validity subjects with composite differences near +0.7-0.9) is the missing mass, not the left tail. (D) GUARDRAILS: Exps 1 (-0.185 vs -0.175) and 3 (0.138 vs 0.123) are already slightly steep and will steepen under (A); compensate by trimming the engaged beta median (2.4 -> ~2.0) or widening epsilon slightly rather than reversing the eta shift, and verify Exp 9's r does not exceed ~0.25 and Exp 4 stays within ~0.02. Do NOT re-inflate beta heterogeneity beyond sd ~0.30 — that was the coupling channel that broke Exp 9 in iter 1.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0968 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1234 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

{
  "interpretation": "The gate rejected iter 4 (loss 0.0968 -> 0.1234), and the per-experiment pattern shows my iter-3 prescriptions were implemented with two critical errors. Empirically, relative to the accepted iter-3 base: every kill/steepness composite moved FURTHER below target (Exp 5: 0.569->0.501 vs real 0.684; Exp 6: 0.538->0.517 vs 0.630; Exp 7: 0.566->0.547 vs 0.646; Exp 8: 0.554->0.447 vs 0.604), the steepness guardrails overshot (Exp 1 slope -0.203 vs real -0.175; Exp 10 rise 0.359 vs 0.296), and Exp 9 collapsed on both statistics (r 0.068 vs 0.196; var 0.147 vs 0.060). Only Exp 2 improved marginally (0.213 vs 0.274). Diagnosis 1 \u2014 arithmetic bug in the redraw dispersion: a lognormal with median 0.16 and log-sd 1.05 has sd = mean*sqrt(e^{sigma^2}-1) = 0.278*1.42 ~= 0.39, not the claimed ~0.21 (the proposer appears to have used the median instead of the mean in the sd formula). The per-ladder redraw is nearly twice as dispersed as designed, which is exactly why Exp 9's cross-ladder r fell to 0.068 and its variance stayed at 2.5x target. Diagnosis 2 \u2014 the heavy upper tail is actively harmful, not helpful: the kill composites are near-knife threshold statistics softened by attention noise, so below-knife subjects only reach p~0.6-0.7 on the tight cells (5x0.9 vs 7x0.7), while tail mass at eta 0.6-2 chooses the low-validity stack near-deterministically at beta 2.9. The composite is dragged down almost one-for-one by upper-tail mass, which is why F(eta<0.34)~0.68 still produced a composite of 0.45. The same tail overshot Exp 1's slope, and the strictly positive lognormal (essentially no mass at eta<=0) drove p_twin->0 on Exp 10's twin cells, inflating the rise to 0.359. Diagnosis 3 \u2014 the reference theories confirm what the real data want: pi_3 (SCWI, effective curvature entirely below the knife) scores 0.606 on Exp 8 (real 0.604) and a 0.371 rise on Exp 10 (real 0.296). The real engaged population is SCWI-like in effective curvature: eta bulk around 0.1-0.25 with a bounded upper tail, not a median-0.16 lognormal with mass out to eta 2. The proposer's own rationale flagged the risk ('I monitor the guardrails: Exps 1/3 may steepen slightly') but underestimated every guardrail breach and overestimated every gain \u2014 their analytic F(knife) threshold model of the composites ignores attention-noise softening and is systematically miscalibrated.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Regenerate, building on the UNCHANGED iter-3 accepted base (the gate already reverted; do not re-derive from iter 4). My iter-3 advice needs explicit correction: the rebalance direction (cut redraw sd, raise stable sd) was right but was implemented with the wrong lognormal arithmetic, and the right-skew prescription backfired \u2014 I withdraw the push toward a heavy upper tail. The new recommendation keeps the iter-3 eta CENTER and fixes only the dispersion and shape. (1) REPLACE THE REDRAW DISTRIBUTION with a symmetric, tightly bounded one: center ~0.20-0.25, sd ~0.25-0.30, hard-clipped to roughly [-0.1, 0.8]. Targets: engaged F(eta < 0.34) ~ 0.65-0.75 and P(eta > 0.6) <= 0.05. If a lognormal is retained for the mild right-skew, use median ~0.20 with log-sd ~0.45-0.55 and VERIFY the actual sd numerically (sd = mean*sqrt(e^{sigma^2}-1)); do not trust the closed-form claim that produced the 0.21-vs-0.39 error. (2) Stable component: center ~0.05, sd 0.13-0.15, giving latent cross-ladder r = sigma_b^2/(sigma_b^2+sigma_c^2) ~ 0.2 with sigma_c ~ 0.27; check Exp 9 lands r in [0.15, 0.25] and var in [0.06, 0.10]. (3) REVERT beta to ~2.4-2.6 (the 2.9 raise overshot Exp 1 and Exp 10) and sharpen the near-knife mapping by CUTTING attention diffusion from 0.14 to ~0.08-0.10 instead \u2014 the kill cells have small score differences, so diffusion noise is what softens below-knife subjects to p~0.6; reducing it lifts the composites without steepening the global anti-validity slope. (4) GUARDRAILS: Exp 1 slope -0.175, Exp 3 ~0.123, Exp 4 ~0.163, Exp 10 rise 0.25-0.33. If Exp 10's rise falls back toward iter 3's 0.173, raise the eta center modestly (to 0.25-0.28) \u2014 do NOT re-inflate the upper tail, which is the channel that broke Exps 5/6/7/8 this iteration. (5) Exp 2 (mean 0.21 vs 0.274, var 0.016 vs 0.093) remains the stubborn residual: its trials fragment across many ladder keys, so per-subject composites average over multiple ctx draws. If variance is still far short after (1)-(3), COARSEN the context key (e.g., hash on the rounded max endorsed validity, or the top-two distinct validities) so more trials within an experiment share one draw \u2014 but never move to a per-experiment block key, which would re-couple Exp 9's two ladders and recreate the iter-1 r=0.44 failure. (6) METHODOLOGICAL: before committing parameters, numerically sweep the eta->composite map (including attention noise, beta, lapse, and the 13% guessers) on the actual Exp 5/6/8/10 cells instead of analytic F(knife) arguments \u2014 that argument predicted composites of 0.62-0.71 this iteration and delivered 0.45-0.52. All changes are parameter/shape recalibrations within the prescribed CNNAI mechanism (additive anti-validity integration, ladder-pooled context-referenced elasticity, softmax + lapse, guesser mixture); no family switch."
