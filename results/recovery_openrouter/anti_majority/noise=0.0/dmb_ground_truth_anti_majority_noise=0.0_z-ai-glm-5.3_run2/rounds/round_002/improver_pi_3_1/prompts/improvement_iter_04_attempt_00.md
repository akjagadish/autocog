# improvement_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a NEW model instantiation of an EXISTING theory, given arbiter feedback on the previous instantiation. The theory's prose claim is fixed — you are NOT redefining the theory. You are regenerating only the runnable bits: the `predict` function, the `policy` function, and the `parameters` ranges. The newly proposed model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The goal of the model improvement process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
If your model fails to compile or behaves badly, you may receive feedback and have to propose another instantiation. Iterate until accepted.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new model instance that ignores the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ROUND THEORIES
The arbiter compared the two theories below this round. Your job is to regenerate ONLY the runnable bits (`predict`, `policy`, `parameters`) of the one tagged **TO REVISE**, keeping its description verbatim. The other theory is shown for context — it is NOT being changed.

### THEORY 1 — `pi_3` **TO REVISE**

**Description (PRESERVE VERBATIM — do not rewrite the prose):**
Signed-Cue Weighted Integration (SCWI). When choosing between two options described by binary expert ratings, subjects do not use a lexicographic cascade (TTB) and do not merely count wins (Tallying). Instead they integrate ALL cues additively into a single subjective value per option — but the mapping from a rating to evidence carries a systematic SIGN INVERSION: a rating of 1 is treated as a defect/criticism rather than an endorsement (a comprehension inversion of the rating direction). Moreover, the inversion is not uniform across cues: the subjective weight of cue j is w_j = -(v_j + tau * v_j^2), i.e. an anti-validity weighting that grows SUPRALINEARLY with the instructed validity — the endorsements of the most trusted experts are avoided most strongly, while low-validity experts are nearly ignored (their anti-weight is small in magnitude). The option with the higher (less negative) signed value is preferred, with softmax noise (inverse temperature beta) and an independent lapse (epsilon) capturing response variability. This single task-invariant mechanism predicts both experimental signatures simultaneously: in Experiment 1, the top-cue-favored option carries more 1s and hence more 'defects', so P(choose the top-cue-favored option) DECREASES with its tally margin (negative slope); in Experiment 2, on margin-1 trials where TTB and the tally disagree the two options' signed values are close together (so noise frequently flips the subject onto the tally winner), whereas when they agree the value gap is large (so the subject reliably anti-follows) — yielding p_disagree > p_agree, a positive metric.

### THEORY 2 — `pi_4` (other theory — context only, NOT revised)

**Description:**
Power-Law Anti-Validity Integration with Heterogeneous Inversion (PAHI). Subjects integrate all cues additively into a per-option subjective value, but a rating of 1 is treated as evidence AGAINST the option (comprehension inversion, s = -1 for ~99% of subjects). The anti-weight of cue j is a free power law of the instructed validity, |w_j| = v_j^gamma, with gamma a free per-subject parameter drawn from a heterogeneous population distribution (gamma ~ 1.4-2.4, mildly supralinear on average). Choice is a softmax over beta * s * sum_j v_j^gamma * rating_j with a symmetric lapse epsilon. Because gamma, beta, and epsilon are drawn broadly per subject, the population reproduces both the mean-level signatures (negative Exp-1 slope, positive Exp-2 dissociation, positive Exp-3 slope, low Exp-4 conflict-following) and the large between-subject variance seen in the real data.

    # rating, where s = -1 for the (vast majority of) comprehension-inverted
    # subjects and +1 for the rare pro-validity subject; gamma is a free

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Keep the SCWI theory description (anti-validity additive integration with w_j = -(v_j + tau*v_j^2), softmax plus lapse) but regenerate the parameterization to fix the two systematic miscalibrations. (1) STRENGTHEN THE CORE: raise beta from [1.1, 1.7] to a per-subject range of roughly [2.0, 6.0] and lower epsilon from [0.05, 0.15] to [0.02, 0.10]. This pushes the diagnostic-cell predictions up toward the observed 0.63-0.68 (d=5 evidence of 0.16-0.31 with beta~3-4 and epsilon~0.05 yields P~0.62-0.72) and also raises the Exp-4 dissociation toward the observed 0.274 (higher beta makes agree-trial anti-following more deterministic while margin-1 disagree trials stay near chance). (2) INTRODUCE REAL HETEROGENEITY: draw beta, epsilon, and tau independently per subject from broad population distributions (e.g., beta log-uniform on [1.5, 6.0], epsilon uniform [0.02, 0.14], tau uniform [0.15, 0.60] — keeping tau below the ~0.65 sign-consistency bound so the theory's guaranteed-sign structure is preserved). A mixture of strongly deterministic anti-validity subjects (driving the diagnostic cells to 0.7+) and noisier subjects (keeping the Exp-6 conflict-following rate near the observed 0.16 and Exp-3/5 slopes intact) naturally reproduces the large observed between-subject variance (~0.06-0.07) that the current narrow, homogeneous parameter box cannot. (3) Optionally add a small per-cue attention/validation jitter parameter (multiplicative noise on the subjective validities) as an additional variance source, which leaves the mean-level predictions unchanged but fattens the between-subject spread on near-threshold trials. Verify the regenerated model against all six experiments: it must simultaneously produce ~0.63-0.68 with var ~0.06 on Exp 1, ~0.60-0.65 with var ~0.07 on Exp 2, slope ~-0.17 to -0.19 on Exp 3, dissociation ~0.25-0.30 on Exp 4, slope ~0.12-0.14 on Exp 5, and ~0.16 on Exp 6.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.277)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

    (tau fixed at 0.35, the midpoint of SCWI's tau range).

    D > 0 means option A carries fewer/smaller anti-validity 'defects'
    and is therefore preferred by SCWI. SCWI predicts a POSITIVE slope
    (~0.2-0.3 with beta in [1.1,1.7], epsilon in [0.05,0.15]).
    Tallying cannot produce a positive slope: on count-tied trials
    (pairs 1-8, 24) it outputs exactly 0.5 for any beta/epsilon, and on
    all remaining trials its choice probability tracks the raw count
    margin, which is strongly ANTI-correlated with D across this design
    (the tally winner is almost always the weighted-margin loser). So
    Tallying's slope is <= 0 (approximately 0 for small beta, clearly

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

    # binary expert ratings. Mechanism is UNCHANGED from the accepted
    # base: subjective validity of cue j = a_j * v_j (per-cue attention
    # factor, fixed for the whole run), signed cue weight
    # w_j = -(v'_j + tau * v'_j^2) (a rating of 1 is a defect; the

    #     deficit is dominated by subjective-sign flips on its
    #     smallest-margin guaranteed cells (|D| just above the 0.08
    #     inclusion threshold), which Exp 6's cell structure avoids.
    #     The iter-3 narrowing to (0.82, 1.18) was masked by the
    #     simultaneous lapse raise; isolate the jitter effect now.
    #   * LAPSE RAISE REVERSED: noisy-regime epsilon pulled back to
    #     [0.06, 0.12] (the iter-2 lapse lever bought nothing on Exp 4
    #     while paying on Exp 5 and the Exp-1 slope). Instead the
    #     noisy beta floor is LOWERED to 0.9: beta acts on the
    #     large-|D| cells (Exp 4 Probe-B conflict cells at |D| ~1.0-1.3,
    #     the Exp-1 larger-margin trials) while Exp 5's small-|D| cells
    #     are nearly beta-insensitive -- the separation the lapse could
    #     not provide.
    #   * EXP-6 GUARD: deterministic fraction raised only +3pp to ~34%
    #     (NOT the 42-48% previously pushed -- the iter-3 result at 31%
    #     validated the cap) and deterministic beta slightly raised to
    #     3.8-5.4 to offset the noisy-beta drop on Exp 6's smaller-D
    #     cells.
    #   * VARIANCE VIA TAU WIDTH: per-subject tau widened to
    #     [0.12, 0.50]. The diagnostic cells have OPPOSITE
    #     tau-coefficients in their evidence margins, so a broad tau
    #     creates genuine bidirectional between-subject spread on

`rationale`: Minimal-diff edit on the accepted iter-3 base; the SCWI mechanism (anti-validity supralinear weights w_j = -(v'_j + tau*v'_j^2) over attention-jittered subjective validities, numerically stable softmax, symmetric lapse) is untouched. I adopt all four of the critic's iter-3 directives, each of which targets a distinct, empirically-diagnosed failure: (1) PRIMARY EXP-5 LEVER — attention jitter narrowed decisively from (0.82, 1.18) to (0.90, 1.10). The critic's diagnostic insight is compelling: Exp 5 and Exp 6 have similar evidence-margin magnitudes, yet the base fits Exp 6 (0.626 vs 0.630) and misses Exp 5 (0.592 vs 0.684); the structural difference is that Exp 5's inclusion rule admits cells with |D| barely above the 0.08 guarantee threshold, where jitter can flip the subjective sign of D and drag noisy subjects to the wrong side, while Exp 6's EXCLUDE set removes its smallest-margin cells. The iter-3 narrowing to (0.82, 1.18) was masked by the simultaneous lapse raise, so the jitter effect is isolated this time. I accept the small Exp-2 cost (~-0.02 dissociation) the proposer's own flip analysis priced in — Exp 2 has been pinned at ~0.19-0.20 across all three iterations regardless of the levers applied, suggesting it sits near this family's structural ceiling and should not be bought at the price of the two biggest recoverable gaps. (2) LAPSE RAISE REVERSED, EXP-4/EXP-1 JOB RE-ASSIGNED TO NOISY BETA — the critic's own iter-2 recommendation (raise noisy epsilon to [0.10, 0.18]) was adopted in iter 3 and empirically failed: Exp 4 was flat (0.118 -> 0.119 vs target 0.163) while Exp 5 (-0.006) and the Exp-1 slope (steepened to -0.226 vs -0.175) paid. So noisy epsilon comes back down to [0.06, 0.12] and the noisy beta floor drops from 1.2 to 0.9. Beta, unlike the lapse, discriminates by cell margin: sigmoid(-beta*|D|) on Exp 4's Probe-B conflict cells (|D| ~1.0-1.3) rises quickly as beta falls, and the Exp-1 slope (carried by larger-margin trials) flattens, while Exp 5's small-|D| cells are nearly beta-insensitive — exactly the separation the lapse could not provide. (3) EXP-6 GUARD — the noisy-beta drop will cost Exp 6 some mean on its smaller-D cells, so the deterministic fraction rises only +3pp (31% -> 34%) and deterministic beta is nudged from 3.6-5.2 to 3.8-5.4. I deliberately do NOT go to the 42-48% the critic pushed in iter 2: the iter-3 result (Exp 6 at 0.626 vs observed 0.630) validated the proposer's cap, and the critic has now explicitly conceded this point. (4) VARIANCE VIA TAU WIDTH — per-subject tau widened from [0.15, 0.40] to [0.12, 0.50]. The two-regime mixture has plateaued on between-subject variance (still 4-8x low on Exps 1/2/5/6); the diagnostic cells have OPPOSITE tau-coefficients in their evidence margins (D = 0.4 - 0.56*tau on some Exp-6 cells vs D = 0.5 + 1.85*tau on others), so a broad tau creates genuine bidirectional subject spread on near-threshold trials while leaving population means approximately unchanged — a variance lever that does not fight the mean targets. The bound stays below the ~0.65 sign-consistency threshold, preserving the guaranteed-sign structure. Expected movement vs iter 3: Exp 5 0.592 -> ~0.64+ (jitter narrowing removes the sign flips on near-threshold cells; noisy subjects' small-|D| probabilities are epsilon- and flip-dominated, not beta-dominated, so the beta drop costs little there), Exp 6 held in [0.60, 0.66] (fraction/beta guard), Exp 4 0.119 -> ~0.14-0.16 (noisy beta floor 0.9 on |D|~1.0-1.3 cells), Exp-1 slope -0.226 -> ~-0.20 (beta flattening), Exp 3 held near 0.13-0.15, and between-subject variance up on Exps 5/6 via the tau width. Every targeted axis moves toward its observed value, so the aggregate loss should land strictly below the iter-3 floor of 0.0830.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed SCWI family (anti-validity supralinear weights w_j = -(v'_j + tau*v'_j^2), softmax, lapse, per-cue attention jitter) — no family drift. It was accepted by the gate (loss 0.0919), and the mean-level fits are already respectable on Experiments 3, 5, and especially 6 (0.637 vs observed 0.630). However, it only PARTIALLY executed the arbiter's recalibration, and the resulting miscalibrations are systematic and diagnosable: (1) HETEROGENEITY IS STILL FAR TOO WEAK. The arbiter prescribed broad per-subject draws (beta log-uniform [1.5, 6.0], epsilon [0.02, 0.14], tau [0.15, 0.60]); the candidate used a narrow box (beta [1.5, 3.2], epsilon [0.04, 0.16], tau [0.20, 0.48]). Consequence: between-subject variances are 5–8x too low everywhere it matters — Exp 1: 0.0006 vs 0.0108; Exp 2: 0.0123 vs 0.0930; Exp 5: 0.0152 vs 0.0643; Exp 6: 0.0099 vs 0.0703. A narrow unimodal box cannot reproduce the observed subject spread; this is the single largest remaining loss source. (2) ANTI-FOLLOWING IS OVER-DETERMINISTIC ON THE CONFLICT METRICS. Exp 4 conflict-following is 0.096 vs observed 0.163 (note pi_3 at beta [1.1,1.7] hit 0.161 — the beta raise to [1.5,3.2] overshot here), and the Exp 1 slope is too steep (-0.238 vs -0.175). Meanwhile (3) Exp 2 dissociation is still short (0.179 vs 0.274) — raising beta alone did not fix it because the epsilon ceiling was simultaneously raised to 0.16, and the lapse pushes agree-trial following back up, canceling the beta gain. The core structural insight: Exp 2 and Exp 4/1 pull the mean-level parameters in opposite directions, and the only in-family resolution is the one the arbiter already pointed to — a genuinely heterogeneous population in which deterministic anti-validity subjects (high beta, low epsilon) drive the Exp 2 agree-trial anti-following and the Exp 5/6 diagnostic cells, while a noisy subpopulation (low beta, higher epsilon) keeps the Exp 4 conflict-following near 0.16, flattens the Exp 1 slope toward -0.175, and — critically — generates the large observed between-subject variances. The candidate's narrow box gives everyone the same middling determinism, which simultaneously misses the variance everywhere and mis-aims the means on Exps 1, 2, and 4.
Rationale: Regenerate (building on this accepted base, since the gate guarantees no regression). Concrete in-family adjustments: (1) Widen the population distributions exactly as prescribed: beta log-uniform on [1.5, 6.0], epsilon uniform [0.02, 0.14], tau uniform [0.15, 0.60], drawn independently per subject. The current epsilon ceiling of 0.16 and beta ceiling of 3.2 are the direct cause of the Exp 2 shortfall (lapse cancels the beta gain on agree trials) — lower the epsilon ceiling and raise the beta ceiling together, as the arbiter computed. (2) Because a uniformly raised beta will further depress Exp 4 (already 0.096 vs 0.163) and steepen Exp 1 (-0.238 vs -0.175), make the heterogeneity effectively mixture-like rather than unimodal: ensure a substantial low-beta/high-epsilon subpopulation (roughly 50–65% of subjects at beta ~1–2, epsilon ~0.08–0.14) alongside high-beta/low-epsilon subjects (beta ~4–6, epsilon ~0.02–0.05). This is a population-distribution shape choice, fully within the prescribed family. Verify the mixture arithmetic against the targets: Exp 4 ~0.16, Exp 1 slope ~-0.17 to -0.19, Exp 2 ~0.25–0.30. (3) Widen the per-cue attention jitter from (0.9, 1.1) to roughly (0.75, 1.25): subjective-validity distortion shrinks the near-threshold evidence gaps on Exp 4 Probe-B trials (|D| ~1.0–1.3) and Exp 2 margin-1 disagree trials, raising Exp 4 follow-rates and p_dis toward 0.5, while the large-gap agree trials and the sign-guaranteed Exp 5/6 cells stay deterministic — and it directly fattens the between-subject spread on exactly those near-threshold trials, attacking the variance deficit (Exp 2 var 0.012 vs 0.093, Exp 5 var 0.015 vs 0.064, Exp 6 var 0.010 vs 0.070). (4) Keep tau below ~0.6 to preserve the guaranteed-sign structure, and re-check Exp 3 (currently 0.159 vs 0.123, slightly steep — the added noisy subpopulation should pull it down toward the target 0.12–0.14) and Exp 6 (currently excellent at 0.637; confirm the mean holds while the variance rises). Do not change the mechanism itself — the SCWI core plus attention jitter is correct; only the population parameterization needs the prescribed broadening.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0919 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0853 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed SCWI family (anti-validity supralinear weights, softmax, lapse, per-cue attention jitter) — no family drift — and it executed my iteration-1 advice (mixture heterogeneity, wider tau, wider attention jitter), which the gate ACCEPTED (loss 0.0919 -> 0.0853). The direction was right: between-subject variance rose on every experiment (Exp 2: 0.012 -> 0.022; Exp 5: 0.015 -> 0.038; Exp 6: 0.010 -> 0.036), Exp 2 dissociation improved (0.179 -> 0.194), Exp 4 improved (0.096 -> 0.118), and Exp 3 is now essentially perfect (0.153 vs 0.123, var matching exactly). But the recalibration overshot on one axis and undershot on two others, and the aggregate gaps are still large enough that shipping now would leave systematic miscalibration on the table. Diagnosis: (1) OVERSHOOT ON EXP 5/6 MEANS. Exp 5 dropped from 0.624 (iter 1) to 0.598 vs observed 0.684, and Exp 6 from 0.637 to 0.606 vs 0.630 — the move went the WRONG way. Two culprits: (a) the noisy subpopulation is too noisy on the small-margin diagnostic cells — Exp 5's guaranteed-sign cells only require |evidence| > 0.08, so beta = 1.0-2.3 leaves these subjects near chance, and at 68% of the population they dilute the mean badly; (b) the widened attention jitter (0.75, 1.25) can flip the subjective-validity ordering on exactly those small-margin cells, breaking the sign guarantee for some subjects and pulling the mean toward 0.5. (2) UNDERSHOOT ON EXP 2 (0.194 vs 0.274): the deterministic fraction (32%) is too small and/or its beta range not extreme enough to drive agree-trial anti-following to the required level. (3) EXP 4 STILL LOW (0.118 vs 0.163) and EXP 1 SLOPE STILL STEEP (-0.218 vs -0.175): the noisy regime's beta floor of 1.0 with epsilon up to only 0.14 does not add enough stochasticity on the |D|~1.0-1.3 Probe-B cells; the lever that raises Exp 4 and flattens Exp 1 without touching Exp 5/6 is the LAPSE, not beta — a higher epsilon in the noisy regime adds ~0.5*eps to conflict-following and flattens the slope while leaving large-gap and sign-guaranteed cells comparatively intact.
Rationale: Regenerate, building on this accepted base, with three targeted in-family population-distribution edits (mechanism untouched): (1) REBALANCE THE MIXTURE TOWARD DETERMINISM: raise the deterministic fraction from 32% to roughly 42-48% (beta ~3.5-6.0, epsilon ~0.02-0.05), and raise the noisy regime's beta floor from 1.0 to ~1.5-1.8 (ceiling ~2.5-3.0). This directly attacks the Exp 5 (0.598 -> target 0.68) and Exp 6 (0.606 -> 0.63) regressions and pushes Exp 2 dissociation toward 0.25-0.30. (2) COMPENSATE EXP 4 / EXP 1 WITH LAPSE, NOT BETA: raise the noisy regime's epsilon range to roughly [0.10, 0.18] (optionally also give the deterministic regime a slightly higher floor, ~0.03). Lapse adds ~0.5*eps to Exp 4 conflict-following (targeting 0.16 from the current 0.118) and flattens the Exp 1 slope toward -0.175, while on the large-gap agree trials and sign-guaranteed Exp 5/6 cells it costs only ~eps*0.4 in mean — the deterministic fraction's gain dominates there. Verify the arithmetic: Exp 4 ~ (1-eps_bar)*sigmoid-weighted core + 0.5*eps_bar should land near 0.16; Exp 5 mean ~ 0.45*deterministic(~0.93) + 0.55*noisy(~0.55-0.65) ~ 0.68. (3) NARROW THE ATTENTION JITTER: the (0.75, 1.25) range is the likely cause of the Exp 5/6 mean regression because it flips sign on small-margin guaranteed cells; pull it back to roughly (0.85, 1.15) and recover the lost between-subject variance instead from the wider tau box and the stronger beta/epsilon mixture contrast (which the variance numbers show is already working — variances rose 2-4x this iteration and should rise further with a sharper mixture). (4) Keep tau in [0.15, 0.60] (below the ~0.65 sign-consistency bound) and re-check Exp 3 (currently excellent at 0.153/var 0.0008 — the noisier epsilon should hold it near 0.12-0.15) and Exp 1 variance (still 5x low at 0.0021 vs 0.0108; the sharper beta contrast between regimes should widen the per-subject slope spread). Do NOT touch the SCWI core, the softmax, or the weight functional form — only the population parameterization and jitter width need adjusting.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0853 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0830 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed SCWI family (anti-validity supralinear weights over attention-jittered subjective validities, softmax, lapse, two-regime population mixture) — no family drift. It was ACCEPTED by the gate (0.0853 -> 0.0830), and my iteration-2 advice was partially adopted: the noisy-regime lapse raise was taken, the deterministic-fraction raise was rejected with cell arithmetic, tau was shifted down, jitter narrowed to (0.82, 1.18). The results vindicate the proposer's deviation on the fraction (Exp 6 is now essentially perfect at 0.626 vs 0.630 — pushing to 42-48% deterministic would indeed have overshot), but the adopted levers underdelivered: (1) EXP 5 REGRESSED (0.598 -> 0.592 vs observed 0.684) and is now the single largest gap (-0.092). The proposer's own arithmetic predicted the tau shift would add ~+0.04 to Exp 5; it delivered nothing (in fact -0.006). (2) The lapse raise — my iter-2 lever — bought essentially NOTHING on Exp 4 (0.118 -> 0.119 vs target 0.163) while paying on Exp 5 and Exp 1 (slope steepened -0.218 -> -0.226 vs -0.175). That lever assignment was wrong and I am reversing it. (3) Exp 2 barely moved (0.194 -> 0.198 vs 0.274); across three iterations SCWI has never exceeded ~0.20 on this metric (pi_3 original: 0.186), suggesting the dissociation is near this family's structural ceiling. (4) Between-subject variances remain 4-8x too low on Exps 1, 2, 5, 6 (0.0014 vs 0.0108; 0.0144 vs 0.0930; 0.0172 vs 0.0643; 0.0180 vs 0.0703) — the two-regime mixture generates a bimodal subject distribution where the real data show a broad continuum. The key diagnostic insight this iteration: Exp 5 and Exp 6 cells have SIMILAR evidence-margin magnitudes, yet the candidate fits Exp 6 (0.626) and misses Exp 5 (0.592). The one structural difference is that Exp 5's inclusion rule admits cells with |D| barely above the 0.08 guarantee threshold, where the (0.82, 1.18) attention jitter can flip the subjective sign of D and drag noisy subjects to the wrong side; Exp 6's cell structure largely avoids its smallest-margin cells (the EXCLUDE set). That identifies the jitter — not beta, not the lapse, not the mixture fraction — as the operative Exp 5 lever, and the iter-3 jitter narrowing was likely masked by the simultaneous lapse raise.
Rationale: Regenerate (building on this accepted base, which the gate guarantees). Four targeted in-family edits, mechanism untouched: (1) PRIMARY EXP-5 LEVER — NARROW THE ATTENTION JITTER DECISIVELY, from (0.82, 1.18) to roughly (0.90, 1.10). Diagnosis: Exp 5's deficit is dominated by sign flips of the subjective evidence on its smallest-margin guaranteed cells (|D| just above the 0.08 inclusion threshold), which Exp 6's cell structure avoids — that is why Exp 6 fits at 0.626 while Exp 5 lags at 0.592 despite comparable D magnitudes. The iter-3 narrowing to (0.82, 1.18) was almost certainly masked by the simultaneous lapse raise; isolate the jitter effect this time. Accept a small Exp-2 cost (the proposer's flip analysis valued wide jitter at ~+0.02 dissociation there); Exp 2 appears near the family's structural ceiling anyway (~0.20 across all three iterations vs 0.274 observed) and should not be bought at the price of the two biggest recoverable gaps. (2) REVERSE THE LAPSE RAISE AND RE-ASSIGN THE EXP-4/EXP-1 JOB TO NOISY BETA: my iter-2 recommendation to raise the noisy epsilon to [0.10, 0.18] was adopted but empirically failed — Exp 4 was flat (0.119 vs 0.163) while Exp 5 and the Exp-1 slope paid. Pull the noisy epsilon back down to roughly [0.06, 0.12] and instead LOWER the noisy beta floor to ~0.9-1.2: beta acts on large-|D| cells (Exp 4's Probe-B conflict cells at |D| ~1.0-1.3, where sigmoid(-beta*D) rises quickly as beta falls; the Exp-1 slope, which is carried by the larger-margin trials) while Exp 5's small-|D| cells are nearly beta-insensitive — the separation the lapse could not provide. Verify the arithmetic by simulation, not analytically: this iteration's cell-level predictions mis-forecast Exp 5 by ~0.06 and Exp 6 by ~0.03, and Monte-Carlo noise is of the same order as some of these deltas — re-run with multiple seeds before accepting a direction. (3) GUARD EXP 6: its included cells are smaller-D than Exp 4's, so the noisy-beta drop will cost Exp 6 some mean. If it falls below ~0.60, compensate with a SMALL deterministic-fraction increase (+2-4pp from 31%, NOT the 42-48% I previously pushed — the Exp-6 result validated the proposer's cap) or by restoring deterministic beta to ~4.2-5.5. (4) VARIANCE VIA TAU WIDTH, NOT REGIME CONTRAST: the two-regime mixture has plateaued on between-subject variance (still 4-8x low on Exps 1/2/5/6). Instead, widen the per-subject tau draw to roughly [0.12, 0.50]: the diagnostic cells have OPPOSITE tau-coefficients in their evidence margins (e.g. D = 0.4 - 0.56*tau on some Exp-6 cells vs D = 0.5 + 1.85*tau on others), so a broad tau creates genuine bidirectional between-subject spread on near-threshold trials while leaving the population means approximately unchanged — a variance lever that does not fight the mean targets. Keep tau below the ~0.65 sign-consistency bound. Success criteria for the next candidate: Exp 5 >= 0.64, Exp 6 held in [0.60, 0.66], Exp 4 in [0.14, 0.18], Exp 1 slope in [-0.21, -0.19], Exp 3 held near 0.13-0.15, and variance up on at least Exps 5/6. Do NOT touch the SCWI core, the softmax, or the weight functional form.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0830 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0819 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed SCWI family (anti-validity supralinear weights over attention-jittered subjective validities, softmax, lapse, two-regime population mixture) — no family drift. It was ACCEPTED (0.0830 -> 0.0819), and my iter-3 advice was partially vindicated: the decisive jitter narrowing to (0.90, 1.10) was the correct Exp-5 lever, delivering +0.029 (0.592 -> 0.621) — the single largest improvement this iteration. However, the other iter-3 levers misfired or were confounded, and the remaining gaps are still large and systematic: Exp 2 dissociation 0.184 vs 0.274 (-0.089, now the biggest gap and slightly WORSE than iter 3's 0.198, the priced-in cost of the jitter narrowing), Exp 5 0.621 vs 0.684 (-0.063), Exp 4 0.108 vs 0.163 (-0.055, REGRESSED from 0.119), Exp 1 slope -0.218 vs -0.175, and between-subject variance still 4-8x low on Exps 1/2/5/6 (0.0021 vs 0.0108; 0.0110 vs 0.0930; 0.0194 vs 0.0643; 0.0128 vs 0.0703). Diagnosis of the Exp-4 regression: the noisy-beta floor drop to 0.9 should have RAISED conflict-following on the |D|~1.0-1.3 Probe-B cells, so the -0.011 movement must be dominated by the simultaneous epsilon pullback from [0.10, 0.18] to [0.06, 0.12] (~0.5*delta_eps ~ -0.02) plus the deterministic-fraction/beta raises — i.e., the lapse was quietly HELPING Exp 4 all along, and my iter-3 claim that it 'bought nothing' was wrong; the iter-3 flatness was masking, not absence of effect. The tau-width variance lever also underdelivered (Exp 6 var went DOWN 0.018 -> 0.0128; Exp 5 up only marginally), so I am retiring that recommendation. The deeper structural diagnosis: the two-regime mixture forces every non-deterministic subject into one box, so any stochasticity added for Exp 4 / the Exp-1 slope is paid for on the small-|D| Exp 5/6 cells by the SAME subjects. The in-family resolution is a genuine THIRD regime: a guessing subpopulation (high lapse, eps ~0.20-0.35) that sits at ~0.5 on every diagnostic. Guessers raise Exp 4 conflict-following toward 0.16, flatten the Exp-1 slope toward -0.175, and — critically — create real between-subject spread, while the mid regime is then free to carry LOW epsilon and moderate beta, pushing the Exp 5/6 means up without re-steepening Exp 1. Back-of-envelope mixture arithmetic (e.g., ~30-35% deterministic at beta 4.2-5.8/eps 0.02-0.04, ~45% mid at beta ~1.8-2.8/eps ~0.04-0.08, ~20-25% guessers) lands Exp 4 ~0.15-0.17, Exp 5 ~0.67-0.71, Exp 6 ~0.62-0.66 — all simultaneously, which no two-regime tuning has achieved in four iterations. Progress is slowing (loss deltas -0.0023, -0.0011), but this decoupling lever is untried and directly targets the three largest remaining mean gaps plus the variance deficit, so one more iteration is warranted rather than shipping at 0.0819.
Rationale: Regenerate (building on this accepted base). Mechanism untouched — SCWI core, softmax, weight functional form, and the (0.90, 1.10) attention jitter all stay exactly as they are; the jitter narrowing was validated this iteration and should NOT be pushed much further (at most (0.92, 1.08); do not widen it again). Three targeted population-distribution edits: (1) PRIMARY LEVER — ADD A GUESSING REGIME: extend the two-regime mixture to three regimes, ~20-25% of subjects with epsilon ~0.20-0.35 (beta irrelevant, keep it mid-range for cleanliness). This is the only in-family lever that raises Exp 4 conflict-following (guessers contribute ~0.5 on the Probe-B cells vs the current noisy ~0.11) and flattens the Exp-1 slope WITHOUT simultaneously degrading the small-|D| Exp 5/6 cells, because the mid regime can then drop its epsilon. It also directly attacks the 4-8x variance deficit on Exps 5/6 by creating genuine trisubject spread (guessers ~0.5, mid ~0.6-0.65, deterministic ~0.85-0.9). (2) REBALANCE THE OTHER TWO REGIMES AROUND IT: deterministic ~30-35% (beta 4.2-5.8, epsilon 0.02-0.04 — note the deterministic beta was raised to 3.8-5.4 this iteration and Exp 6 still slipped to 0.613, so guard Exp 6 by tuning the deterministic FRACTION, not its beta ceiling, which is near its useful limit), and mid regime ~45-50% with beta ~1.8-2.8 and LOW epsilon ~0.04-0.08. On the epsilon of the mid regime specifically, I have now oscillated (iter 2: raise to [0.10,0.18]; iter 3-4: lower to [0.06,0.12]) — settle strictly BETWEEN the flanking iterations at roughly [0.07, 0.11] for the mid regime, with the guessing regime providing the additional stochasticity that the mid regime's epsilon was being asked to supply. (3) TAU: the width widening to [0.12, 0.50] did not deliver the promised variance (Exp 6 var fell) — revert toward [0.15, 0.42] or simply keep it; do not widen further, and do not expect variance from it. Verify by multi-seed simulation, not analytic cell arithmetic (my iter-3 cell-level predictions mis-forecast Exp 4's direction): success criteria are Exp 4 in [0.14, 0.18], Exp 5 >= 0.65, Exp 6 in [0.60, 0.66], Exp 1 slope in [-0.21, -0.18], Exp 3 held near 0.13-0.15, and between-subject variance at least doubled on Exps 5/6. Accept that Exp 2 (~0.18-0.20 vs 0.274) is near this family's structural ceiling — do not trade the recoverable Exp 4/5 gaps for it. Do NOT touch the SCWI core, the softmax, the lapse functional form, or the weight functional form.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0819 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep the theory's prose claim implicit but unchanged, and keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

I adopt the critic's iter-4 diagnosis in full, since every prior iteration of its advice that was executed has been ACCEPTED (0.0919 -> 0.0853 -> 0.0830 -> 0.0819): (1) PRIMARY LEVER — THREE-REGIME MIXTURE. The critic's structural diagnosis is the right one: in the two-regime mixture, every non-deterministic subject pays for the Exp-4 / Exp-1 stochasticity on the small-|D| Exp 5/6 cells, which is why four iterations of beta/epsilon tuning inside two regimes kept trading the same gaps against each other (progress deltas shrinking: -0.0023, -0.0011). A guessing subpopulation (~22%, epsilon 0.20-0.35, beta held mid-range for cleanliness) sits at ~0.5 on every diagnostic cell: it raises Exp 4 conflict-following toward 0.16 (guessers contribute ~0.5 on the Probe-B cells vs the current noisy ~0.11), flattens the Exp-1 slope toward -0.175, and creates genuine tri-modal between-subject spread (guessers ~0.5, mid ~0.6-0.65, deterministic ~0.85-0.9) attacking the 4-8x variance deficit on Exps 5/6 — without degrading the small-|D| cells, because the mid regime is now free to carry LOW epsilon. (2) MID REGIME at beta 1.8-2.8 with epsilon settled strictly between my oscillating prior recommendations at [0.07, 0.11] — the guessing regime supplies the stochasticity the mid epsilon was previously being asked to carry alone. (3) DETERMINISTIC REGIME at ~32% with beta 4.2-5.8 / epsilon 0.02-0.04, fraction (not beta ceiling) guarding Exp 6, per the critic's explicit instruction. (4) TAU REVERTED from [0.12, 0.50] to [0.15, 0.42] — the iter-4 widening demonstrably failed to deliver variance (Exp 6 var fell 0.018 -> 0.0128), so that lever is retired; still below the ~0.65 sign-consistency bound. Expected movement vs iter 4: Exp 4 0.108 -> ~0.15-0.17 (guessers at ~0.5 on conflict cells plus mid-regime anti-following), Exp 5 0.621 -> ~0.66-0.70 (mid regime's epsilon drop makes small-|D| cells more deterministic; deterministic regime unchanged), Exp 6 held in [0.60, 0.66] (deterministic fraction guarded), Exp-1 slope -0.218 -> ~-0.19 (guessers flatten the large-margin trials), Exp 3 held near 0.13-0.15, and between-subject variance at least doubled on Exps 5/6 from the tri-modal subject distribution. Exp 2 (~0.18-0.20 vs 0.274) is accepted as near this family's structural ceiling and is not traded for the recoverable Exp 4/5 gaps, per the critic's explicit guidance. Every targeted axis moves toward its observed value, so the aggregate loss should land strictly below the iter-4 floor of 0.0819."
