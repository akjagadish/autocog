# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Keep the SCWI theory description (anti-validity additive integration with w_j = -(v_j + tau*v_j^2), softmax plus lapse) but regenerate the parameterization to fix the two systematic miscalibrations. (1) STRENGTHEN THE CORE: raise beta from [1.1, 1.7] to a per-subject range of roughly [2.0, 6.0] and lower epsilon from [0.05, 0.15] to [0.02, 0.10]. This pushes the diagnostic-cell predictions up toward the observed 0.63-0.68 (d=5 evidence of 0.16-0.31 with beta~3-4 and epsilon~0.05 yields P~0.62-0.72) and also raises the Exp-4 dissociation toward the observed 0.274 (higher beta makes agree-trial anti-following more deterministic while margin-1 disagree trials stay near chance). (2) INTRODUCE REAL HETEROGENEITY: draw beta, epsilon, and tau independently per subject from broad population distributions (e.g., beta log-uniform on [1.5, 6.0], epsilon uniform [0.02, 0.14], tau uniform [0.15, 0.60] — keeping tau below the ~0.65 sign-consistency bound so the theory's guaranteed-sign structure is preserved). A mixture of strongly deterministic anti-validity subjects (driving the diagnostic cells to 0.7+) and noisier subjects (keeping the Exp-6 conflict-following rate near the observed 0.16 and Exp-3/5 slopes intact) naturally reproduces the large observed between-subject variance (~0.06-0.07) that the current narrow, homogeneous parameter box cannot. (3) Optionally add a small per-cue attention/validation jitter parameter (multiplicative noise on the subjective validities) as an additional variance source, which leaves the mean-level predictions unchanged but fattens the between-subject spread on near-threshold trials. Verify the regenerated model against all six experiments: it must simultaneously produce ~0.63-0.68 with var ~0.06 on Exp 1, ~0.60-0.65 with var ~0.07 on Exp 2, slope ~-0.17 to -0.19 on Exp 3, dissociation ~0.25-0.30 on Exp 4, slope ~0.12-0.14 on Exp 5, and ~0.16 on Exp 6.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Signed-Cue Weighted Integration (SCWI). When choosing between two options described by binary expert ratings, subjects do not use a lexicographic cascade (TTB) and do not merely count wins (Tallying). Instead they integrate ALL cues additively into a single subjective value per option — but the mapping from a rating to evidence carries a systematic SIGN INVERSION: a rating of 1 is treated as a defect/criticism rather than an endorsement (a comprehension inversion of the rating direction). Moreover, the inversion is not uniform across cues: the subjective weight of cue j is w_j = -(v_j + tau * v_j^2), i.e. an anti-validity weighting that grows SUPRALINEARLY with the instructed validity — the endorsements of the most trusted experts are avoided most strongly, while low-validity experts are nearly ignored (their anti-weight is small in magnitude). The option with the higher (less negative) signed value is preferred, with softmax noise (inverse temperature beta) and an independent lapse (epsilon) capturing response variability. This single task-invariant mechanism predicts both experimental signatures simultaneously: in Experiment 1, the top-cue-favored option carries more 1s and hence more 'defects', so P(choose the top-cue-favored option) DECREASES with its tally margin (negative slope); in Experiment 2, on margin-1 trials where TTB and the tally disagree the two options' signed values are close together (so noise frequently flips the subject onto the tally winner), whereas when they agree the value gap is large (so the subject reliably anti-follows) — yielding p_disagree > p_agree, a positive metric.

    #     deterministic fraction to ~45% OVERSHOOTS the Exp-6 ladder
    #     cells (deterministic subjects sit near 0.75-0.80 there, so a
    #     45% mixture lands ~0.68-0.69 vs observed 0.63) and drives
    #     Exp-4 conflict-following down toward ~0.10 vs observed 0.163.
    #   * deterministic beta LOWERED to 3.6-5.2: the Exp-2 dissociation
    #     peaks at moderate beta (very high beta makes the small-|D|
    #     margin-1 disagree trials anti-follow deterministically too,
    #     collapsing p_disagree).
    #   * noisy regime: beta 1.2-2.2, epsilon 0.10-0.18 (critic's lapse
    #     rebalancing adopted: the lapse, not beta, is what raises Exp-4
    #     conflict-following toward 0.16 and flattens the Exp-1 slope).
    #   * tau SHIFTED DOWN and narrowed to [0.15, 0.40]: the SCWI
    #     evidence margins on the Exp-5/6 diagnostic cells are
    #     DECREASING in tau (e.g. D = 0.5 - 0.75*tau on the 2-top-cue
    #     vs 5-low-cue cells), so a lower mean tau raises both Exp-5
    #     and Exp-6 toward their targets while staying below the
    #     ~0.65 sign-consistency bound.
    #   * attention jitter kept moderately wide, (0.82, 1.18): sign
    #     flips on the small-|D| margin-1 disagree trials of Exp-2
    #     raise p_disagree (the largest residual gap), and the Exp-5/6

`rationale`:
Minimal-diff edit on the accepted base; the SCWI mechanism (anti-validity supralinear weights w_j = -(v'_j + tau*v'_j^2) over attention-jittered subjective validities, stable softmax, symmetric lapse) is untouched. I adopted the critic's diagnosis partially and deviated on two axes with cell-level arithmetic as justification. ADOPTED: (1) the noisy regime's lapse is raised to [0.10, 0.18] — the lapse, not beta, is the lever that raises Exp-4 conflict-following (each +0.01 of epsilon adds ~0.005 to follow-rate on the |D|~1.0 Probe-B cells) and flattens the Exp-1 slope, while costing little on sign-guaranteed cells; (2) the deterministic regime's epsilon floor drops to 0.025. DEVIATION 1 — deterministic fraction capped at ~31% and its beta LOWERED to 3.6-5.2 (critic asked 42-48% at beta 3.5-6.0). Working through the actual Exp-6 ladder cells (all included cells have SCWI preferring the top option with margins D = 0.4-0.56tau, 0.6-0.31tau, 0.5-0.75tau, 0.9-1.31tau, 0.5+1.85tau), deterministic subjects sit near 0.75-0.80, so a 45% deterministic mixture lands Exp-6 at ~0.68-0.69 vs observed 0.630 (a regression from iter 2's 0.606 distance), and simultaneously pushes Exp-4 conflict-following down toward ~0.10 vs observed 0.163. A 31% fraction with the tau shift below lands Exp-6 at ~0.66 and Exp-4 at ~0.13. Lowering deterministic beta also helps Exp-2: the dissociation peaks at moderate beta because very high beta makes the small-|D| margin-1 disagree trials (|D| in 0.00-0.45) anti-follow deterministically too, collapsing p_disagree — at beta~4.2 the deterministic dissociation is ~0.17 vs ~0.14 at beta 5.5. DEVIATION 2 — the key new lever is tau, shifted down and narrowed to [0.15, 0.40] (critic said keep [0.15, 0.60]). The Exp-5/Exp-6 diagnostic cells' SCWI evidence margins are strictly DECREASING in tau (e.g. D = 0.5-0.75tau on the 2-top-cue vs 5-low-cue cells of Exp 5, D = 0.4-0.56tau on the Exp-6 (2, 4x0.60) cells): lowering mean tau from 0.375 to ~0.275 raises the Exp-5 mean by ~+0.04 and Exp-6 by ~+0.03 without touching the mechanism, exactly what the critic's Exp-5/6 recovery target needs, while the sign of D is preserved for all tau <= 0.60 so the guaranteed-sign structure is intact. The attention jitter is narrowed only moderately, to (0.82, 1.18): my flip analysis shows wide jitter materially RAISES Exp-2's p_disagree (sign flips on the small-|D| disagree trials convert anti-follows into follows, worth ~+0.02 dissociation — and Exp-2 is the largest residual gap at 0.19 vs 0.27), so collapsing the jitter to (0.85, 1.15) would trade a small Exp-5/6 gain for a larger Exp-2 loss; the tau shift already delivers the Exp-5/6 recovery. Expected movement vs iter 2: Exp-1 slope -0.218 -> ~-0.21 (noisy-lapse flattening), Exp-2 0.194 -> ~0.19 (held despite narrower tau/jitter via the deterministic-beta reduction), Exp-3 0.153 -> ~0.15, Exp-4 0.118 -> ~0.13 (lapse), Exp-5 0.598 -> ~0.65 (tau shift + deterministic hit-rate), Exp-6 0.606 -> ~0.66. Aggregate distance drops on every axis except a small Exp-6 give-back, for a net ~15-20% reduction in total/L2 error — comfortably below the iter-2 floor. The sharper two-regime contrast plus the tau and attention spread keeps the between-subject variance gains from iter 2 (the variance deficit is addressed by the mixture contrast itself, which iter 2 showed rises with regime separation).

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0919 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0853 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0830 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0830.

    margin D = sum_j u_j * (b_j - a_j), with u_j = v_j + tau * v_j^2
    (tau fixed at 0.35, the midpoint of SCWI's tau range).

    D > 0 means option A carries fewer/smaller anti-validity 'defects'
    and is therefore preferred by SCWI. SCWI predicts a POSITIVE slope
    (~0.2-0.3 with beta in [1.1,1.7], epsilon in [0.05,0.15]).
    Tallying cannot produce a positive slope: on count-tied trials
    (pairs 1-8, 24) it outputs exactly 0.5 for any beta/epsilon, and on
    all remaining trials its choice probability tracks the raw count
    margin, which is strongly ANTI-correlated with D across this design
    (the tally winner is almost always the weighted-margin loser). So
    Tallying's slope is <= 0 (approximately 0 for small beta, clearly
    negative for large beta). The sign separation is parameter-free.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed SCWI family (anti-validity supralinear weights w_j = -(v'_j + tau*v'_j^2), softmax, lapse, per-cue attention jitter) — no family drift. It was accepted by the gate (loss 0.0919), and the mean-level fits are already respectable on Experiments 3, 5, and especially 6 (0.637 vs observed 0.630). However, it only PARTIALLY executed the arbiter's recalibration, and the resulting miscalibrations are systematic and diagnosable: (1) HETEROGENEITY IS STILL FAR TOO WEAK. The arbiter prescribed broad per-subject draws (beta log-uniform [1.5, 6.0], epsilon [0.02, 0.14], tau [0.15, 0.60]); the candidate used a narrow box (beta [1.5, 3.2], epsilon [0.04, 0.16], tau [0.20, 0.48]). Consequence: between-subject variances are 5–8x too low everywhere it matters — Exp 1: 0.0006 vs 0.0108; Exp 2: 0.0123 vs 0.0930; Exp 5: 0.0152 vs 0.0643; Exp 6: 0.0099 vs 0.0703. A narrow unimodal box cannot reproduce the observed subject spread; this is the single largest remaining loss source. (2) ANTI-FOLLOWING IS OVER-DETERMINISTIC ON THE CONFLICT METRICS. Exp 4 conflict-following is 0.096 vs observed 0.163 (note pi_3 at beta [1.1,1.7] hit 0.161 — the beta raise to [1.5,3.2] overshot here), and the Exp 1 slope is too steep (-0.238 vs -0.175). Meanwhile (3) Exp 2 dissociation is still short (0.179 vs 0.274) — raising beta alone did not fix it because the epsilon ceiling was simultaneously raised to 0.16, and the lapse pushes agree-trial following back up, canceling the beta gain. The core structural insight: Exp 2 and Exp 4/1 pull the mean-level parameters in opposite directions, and the only in-family resolution is the one the arbiter already pointed to — a genuinely heterogeneous population in which deterministic anti-validity subjects (high beta, low epsilon) drive the Exp 2 agree-trial anti-following and the Exp 5/6 diagnostic cells, while a noisy subpopulation (low beta, higher epsilon) keeps the Exp 4 conflict-following near 0.16, flattens the Exp 1 slope toward -0.175, and — critically — generates the large observed between-subject variances. The candidate's narrow box gives everyone the same middling determinism, which simultaneously misses the variance everywhere and mis-aims the means on Exps 1, 2, and 4.
Rationale: Regenerate (building on this accepted base, since the gate guarantees no regression). Concrete in-family adjustments: (1) Widen the population distributions exactly as prescribed: beta log-uniform on [1.5, 6.0], epsilon uniform [0.02, 0.14], tau uniform [0.15, 0.60], drawn independently per subject. The current epsilon ceiling of 0.16 and beta ceiling of 3.2 are the direct cause of the Exp 2 shortfall (lapse cancels the beta gain on agree trials) — lower the epsilon ceiling and raise the beta ceiling together, as the arbiter computed. (2) Because a uniformly raised beta will further depress Exp 4 (already 0.096 vs 0.163) and steepen Exp 1 (-0.238 vs -0.175), make the heterogeneity effectively mixture-like rather than unimodal: ensure a substantial low-beta/high-epsilon subpopulation (roughly 50–65% of subjects at beta ~1–2, epsilon ~0.08–0.14) alongside high-beta/low-epsilon subjects (beta ~4–6, epsilon ~0.02–0.05). This is a population-distribution shape choice, fully within the prescribed family. Verify the mixture arithmetic against the targets: Exp 4 ~0.16, Exp 1 slope ~-0.17 to -0.19, Exp 2 ~0.25–0.30. (3) Widen the per-cue attention jitter from (0.9, 1.1) to roughly (0.75, 1.25): subjective-validity distortion shrinks the near-threshold evidence gaps on Exp 4 Probe-B trials (|D| ~1.0–1.3) and Exp 2 margin-1 disagree trials, raising Exp 4 follow-rates and p_dis toward 0.5, while the large-gap agree trials and the sign-guaranteed Exp 5/6 cells stay deterministic — and it directly fattens the between-subject spread on exactly those near-threshold trials, attacking the variance deficit (Exp 2 var 0.012 vs 0.093, Exp 5 var 0.015 vs 0.064, Exp 6 var 0.010 vs 0.070). (4) Keep tau below ~0.6 to preserve the guaranteed-sign structure, and re-check Exp 3 (currently 0.159 vs 0.123, slightly steep — the added noisy subpopulation should pull it down toward the target 0.12–0.14) and Exp 6 (currently excellent at 0.637; confirm the mean holds while the variance rises). Do not change the mechanism itself — the SCWI core plus attention jitter is correct; only the population parameterization needs the prescribed broadening.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0919 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0853 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed SCWI family (anti-validity supralinear weights, softmax, lapse, per-cue attention jitter) — no family drift — and it executed my iteration-1 advice (mixture heterogeneity, wider tau, wider attention jitter), which the gate ACCEPTED (loss 0.0919 -> 0.0853). The direction was right: between-subject variance rose on every experiment (Exp 2: 0.012 -> 0.022; Exp 5: 0.015 -> 0.038; Exp 6: 0.010 -> 0.036), Exp 2 dissociation improved (0.179 -> 0.194), Exp 4 improved (0.096 -> 0.118), and Exp 3 is now essentially perfect (0.153 vs 0.123, var matching exactly). But the recalibration overshot on one axis and undershot on two others, and the aggregate gaps are still large enough that shipping now would leave systematic miscalibration on the table. Diagnosis: (1) OVERSHOOT ON EXP 5/6 MEANS. Exp 5 dropped from 0.624 (iter 1) to 0.598 vs observed 0.684, and Exp 6 from 0.637 to 0.606 vs 0.630 — the move went the WRONG way. Two culprits: (a) the noisy subpopulation is too noisy on the small-margin diagnostic cells — Exp 5's guaranteed-sign cells only require |evidence| > 0.08, so beta = 1.0-2.3 leaves these subjects near chance, and at 68% of the population they dilute the mean badly; (b) the widened attention jitter (0.75, 1.25) can flip the subjective-validity ordering on exactly those small-margin cells, breaking the sign guarantee for some subjects and pulling the mean toward 0.5. (2) UNDERSHOOT ON EXP 2 (0.194 vs 0.274): the deterministic fraction (32%) is too small and/or its beta range not extreme enough to drive agree-trial anti-following to the required level. (3) EXP 4 STILL LOW (0.118 vs 0.163) and EXP 1 SLOPE STILL STEEP (-0.218 vs -0.175): the noisy regime's beta floor of 1.0 with epsilon up to only 0.14 does not add enough stochasticity on the |D|~1.0-1.3 Probe-B cells; the lever that raises Exp 4 and flattens Exp 1 without touching Exp 5/6 is the LAPSE, not beta — a higher epsilon in the noisy regime adds ~0.5*eps to conflict-following and flattens the slope while leaving large-gap and sign-guaranteed cells comparatively intact.
Rationale: Regenerate, building on this accepted base, with three targeted in-family population-distribution edits (mechanism untouched): (1) REBALANCE THE MIXTURE TOWARD DETERMINISM: raise the deterministic fraction from 32% to roughly 42-48% (beta ~3.5-6.0, epsilon ~0.02-0.05), and raise the noisy regime's beta floor from 1.0 to ~1.5-1.8 (ceiling ~2.5-3.0). This directly attacks the Exp 5 (0.598 -> target 0.68) and Exp 6 (0.606 -> 0.63) regressions and pushes Exp 2 dissociation toward 0.25-0.30. (2) COMPENSATE EXP 4 / EXP 1 WITH LAPSE, NOT BETA: raise the noisy regime's epsilon range to roughly [0.10, 0.18] (optionally also give the deterministic regime a slightly higher floor, ~0.03). Lapse adds ~0.5*eps to Exp 4 conflict-following (targeting 0.16 from the current 0.118) and flattens the Exp 1 slope toward -0.175, while on the large-gap agree trials and sign-guaranteed Exp 5/6 cells it costs only ~eps*0.4 in mean — the deterministic fraction's gain dominates there. Verify the arithmetic: Exp 4 ~ (1-eps_bar)*sigmoid-weighted core + 0.5*eps_bar should land near 0.16; Exp 5 mean ~ 0.45*deterministic(~0.93) + 0.55*noisy(~0.55-0.65) ~ 0.68. (3) NARROW THE ATTENTION JITTER: the (0.75, 1.25) range is the likely cause of the Exp 5/6 mean regression because it flips sign on small-margin guaranteed cells; pull it back to roughly (0.85, 1.15) and recover the lost between-subject variance instead from the wider tau box and the stronger beta/epsilon mixture contrast (which the variance numbers show is already working — variances rose 2-4x this iteration and should rise further with a sharper mixture). (4) Keep tau in [0.15, 0.60] (below the ~0.65 sign-consistency bound) and re-check Exp 3 (currently excellent at 0.153/var 0.0008 — the noisier epsilon should hold it near 0.12-0.15) and Exp 1 variance (still 5x low at 0.0021 vs 0.0108; the sharper beta contrast between regimes should widen the per-subject slope spread). Do NOT touch the SCWI core, the softmax, or the weight functional form — only the population parameterization and jitter width need adjusting.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0853 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0830 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed SCWI family (anti-validity supralinear weights over attention-jittered subjective validities, softmax, lapse, two-regime population mixture) \u2014 no family drift. It was ACCEPTED by the gate (0.0853 -> 0.0830), and my iteration-2 advice was partially adopted: the noisy-regime lapse raise was taken, the deterministic-fraction raise was rejected with cell arithmetic, tau was shifted down, jitter narrowed to (0.82, 1.18). The results vindicate the proposer's deviation on the fraction (Exp 6 is now essentially perfect at 0.626 vs 0.630 \u2014 pushing to 42-48% deterministic would indeed have overshot), but the adopted levers underdelivered: (1) EXP 5 REGRESSED (0.598 -> 0.592 vs observed 0.684) and is now the single largest gap (-0.092). The proposer's own arithmetic predicted the tau shift would add ~+0.04 to Exp 5; it delivered nothing (in fact -0.006). (2) The lapse raise \u2014 my iter-2 lever \u2014 bought essentially NOTHING on Exp 4 (0.118 -> 0.119 vs target 0.163) while paying on Exp 5 and Exp 1 (slope steepened -0.218 -> -0.226 vs -0.175). That lever assignment was wrong and I am reversing it. (3) Exp 2 barely moved (0.194 -> 0.198 vs 0.274); across three iterations SCWI has never exceeded ~0.20 on this metric (pi_3 original: 0.186), suggesting the dissociation is near this family's structural ceiling. (4) Between-subject variances remain 4-8x too low on Exps 1, 2, 5, 6 (0.0014 vs 0.0108; 0.0144 vs 0.0930; 0.0172 vs 0.0643; 0.0180 vs 0.0703) \u2014 the two-regime mixture generates a bimodal subject distribution where the real data show a broad continuum. The key diagnostic insight this iteration: Exp 5 and Exp 6 cells have SIMILAR evidence-margin magnitudes, yet the candidate fits Exp 6 (0.626) and misses Exp 5 (0.592). The one structural difference is that Exp 5's inclusion rule admits cells with |D| barely above the 0.08 guarantee threshold, where the (0.82, 1.18) attention jitter can flip the subjective sign of D and drag noisy subjects to the wrong side; Exp 6's cell structure largely avoids its smallest-margin cells (the EXCLUDE set). That identifies the jitter \u2014 not beta, not the lapse, not the mixture fraction \u2014 as the operative Exp 5 lever, and the iter-3 jitter narrowing was likely masked by the simultaneous lapse raise.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Regenerate (building on this accepted base, which the gate guarantees). Four targeted in-family edits, mechanism untouched: (1) PRIMARY EXP-5 LEVER \u2014 NARROW THE ATTENTION JITTER DECISIVELY, from (0.82, 1.18) to roughly (0.90, 1.10). Diagnosis: Exp 5's deficit is dominated by sign flips of the subjective evidence on its smallest-margin guaranteed cells (|D| just above the 0.08 inclusion threshold), which Exp 6's cell structure avoids \u2014 that is why Exp 6 fits at 0.626 while Exp 5 lags at 0.592 despite comparable D magnitudes. The iter-3 narrowing to (0.82, 1.18) was almost certainly masked by the simultaneous lapse raise; isolate the jitter effect this time. Accept a small Exp-2 cost (the proposer's flip analysis valued wide jitter at ~+0.02 dissociation there); Exp 2 appears near the family's structural ceiling anyway (~0.20 across all three iterations vs 0.274 observed) and should not be bought at the price of the two biggest recoverable gaps. (2) REVERSE THE LAPSE RAISE AND RE-ASSIGN THE EXP-4/EXP-1 JOB TO NOISY BETA: my iter-2 recommendation to raise the noisy epsilon to [0.10, 0.18] was adopted but empirically failed \u2014 Exp 4 was flat (0.119 vs 0.163) while Exp 5 and the Exp-1 slope paid. Pull the noisy epsilon back down to roughly [0.06, 0.12] and instead LOWER the noisy beta floor to ~0.9-1.2: beta acts on large-|D| cells (Exp 4's Probe-B conflict cells at |D| ~1.0-1.3, where sigmoid(-beta*D) rises quickly as beta falls; the Exp-1 slope, which is carried by the larger-margin trials) while Exp 5's small-|D| cells are nearly beta-insensitive \u2014 the separation the lapse could not provide. Verify the arithmetic by simulation, not analytically: this iteration's cell-level predictions mis-forecast Exp 5 by ~0.06 and Exp 6 by ~0.03, and Monte-Carlo noise is of the same order as some of these deltas \u2014 re-run with multiple seeds before accepting a direction. (3) GUARD EXP 6: its included cells are smaller-D than Exp 4's, so the noisy-beta drop will cost Exp 6 some mean. If it falls below ~0.60, compensate with a SMALL deterministic-fraction increase (+2-4pp from 31%, NOT the 42-48% I previously pushed \u2014 the Exp-6 result validated the proposer's cap) or by restoring deterministic beta to ~4.2-5.5. (4) VARIANCE VIA TAU WIDTH, NOT REGIME CONTRAST: the two-regime mixture has plateaued on between-subject variance (still 4-8x low on Exps 1/2/5/6). Instead, widen the per-subject tau draw to roughly [0.12, 0.50]: the diagnostic cells have OPPOSITE tau-coefficients in their evidence margins (e.g. D = 0.4 - 0.56*tau on some Exp-6 cells vs D = 0.5 + 1.85*tau on others), so a broad tau creates genuine bidirectional between-subject spread on near-threshold trials while leaving the population means approximately unchanged \u2014 a variance lever that does not fight the mean targets. Keep tau below the ~0.65 sign-consistency bound. Success criteria for the next candidate: Exp 5 >= 0.64, Exp 6 held in [0.60, 0.66], Exp 4 in [0.14, 0.18], Exp 1 slope in [-0.21, -0.19], Exp 3 held near 0.13-0.15, and variance up on at least Exps 5/6. Do NOT touch the SCWI core, the softmax, or the weight functional form."
