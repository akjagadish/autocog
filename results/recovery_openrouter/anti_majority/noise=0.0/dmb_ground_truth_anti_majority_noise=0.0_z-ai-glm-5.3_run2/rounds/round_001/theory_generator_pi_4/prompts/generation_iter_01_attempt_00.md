# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace Tallying (pi_2) with a new theory: 'Power-Law Anti-Validity Integration with Heterogeneous Inversion' (PAHI). Core claims: (1) Subjects integrate all cues additively into a per-option subjective value, but interpret a rating of 1 as evidence AGAINST the option (comprehension inversion), exactly as SCWI holds. (2) The magnitude of the anti-weight for cue j is a free power-law of the instructed validity, |w_j| = v_j^gamma, with gamma a free parameter (gamma=1 recovers linear anti-validity; gamma>1 supralinear; gamma<1 compresses the validity gradient). This replaces SCWI's rigid fixed quadratic form w_j = -(v_j + tau*v_j^2) with a more flexible one-parameter family, allowing steeper validity gradients where SCWI under-predicted (Experiment 4's observed 0.2737 vs SCWI's 0.1862 is consistent with a steeper-than-quadratic weighting, i.e., larger gamma, which widens the value gap on TTB/tally-agreement trials and drives p_agree lower). (3) Heterogeneity: each subject draws gamma from a distribution (e.g., gamma in [1.0, 3.0]) and an inversion sign s in {-1, +1} with P(s=-1) high (e.g., 0.85), capturing occasional pro-validity subjects and the large between-subject variance (var=0.093) seen in Experiment 4. (4) Choice is a softmax over beta * s * sum_j v_j^gamma * rating_j with a symmetric lapse epsilon, exactly as in SCWI. This theory differs from both incumbents: unlike Tallying it uses validity-weighted (inverted) evidence rather than raw counts, so it correctly predicts the sign of all four observed metrics; unlike SCWI it has a flexible power-law weight map and subject-level heterogeneity, so it can match Experiment 4's more extreme observed dissociation while remaining fully consistent with Experiments 1-3 (where gamma in [1.5, 2.5] reproduces SCWI's near-perfect fits). Suggested parameter ranges: beta in [0.8, 2.0], gamma in [1.0, 3.0], epsilon in [0.05, 0.20], P(inverted) in [0.75, 0.95].

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 1.000)

**Description**
Signed-Cue Weighted Integration (SCWI). When choosing between two options described by binary expert ratings, subjects do not use a lexicographic cascade (TTB) and do not merely count wins (Tallying). Instead they integrate ALL cues additively into a single subjective value per option — but the mapping from a rating to evidence carries a systematic SIGN INVERSION: a rating of 1 is treated as a defect/criticism rather than an endorsement (a comprehension inversion of the rating direction). Moreover, the inversion is not uniform across cues: the subjective weight of cue j is w_j = -(v_j + tau * v_j^2), i.e. an anti-validity weighting that grows SUPRALINEARLY with the instructed validity — the endorsements of the most trusted experts are avoided most strongly, while low-validity experts are nearly ignored (their anti-weight is small in magnitude). The option with the higher (less negative) signed value is preferred, with softmax noise (inverse temperature beta) and an independent lapse (epsilon) capturing response variability. This single task-invariant mechanism predicts both experimental signatures simultaneously: in Experiment 1, the top-cue-favored option carries more 1s and hence more 'defects', so P(choose the top-cue-favored option) DECREASES with its tally margin (negative slope); in Experiment 2, on margin-1 trials where TTB and the tally disagree the two options' signed values are close together (so noise frequently flips the subject onto the tally winner), whereas when they agree the value gap is large (so the subject reliably anti-follows) — yielding p_disagree > p_agree, a positive metric.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.098)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0872 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0872 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

    all remaining trials its choice probability tracks the raw count
    margin, which is strongly ANTI-correlated with D across this design
    (the tally winner is almost always the weighted-margin loser). So

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Power-Law Anti-Validity Integration with Heterogeneous Inversion (PAHI). When choosing between two options described by binary expert ratings, subjects integrate ALL cues additively into a single subjective value per option, but the mapping from a rating to evidence carries a systematic comprehension inversion: a rating of 1 is treated as a defect/criticism of the option, not an endorsement. The magnitude of the anti-weight of cue j is a free power law of the instructed validity, |w_j| = v_j^gamma, with gamma a free per-subject parameter: gamma = 1 recovers linear anti-validity, gamma > 1 (supralinear, here gamma ~ 2-2.4) means the endorsements of the most trusted experts are avoided most strongly while low-validity experts are nearly ignored. Each subject draws gamma, an inverse temperature beta, and a lapse epsilon from a population distribution (heterogeneity), and draws an inversion sign s in {-1, +1}, with the population inversion rate pinned near 1 (the data rule out a substantial pro-validity subpopulation). Choice is a softmax over beta * s * sum_j v_j^gamma * rating_j, mixed with a symmetric lapse epsilon. This single task-invariant mechanism predicts all four experimental signatures: (1) in Experiment 1 the top-cue-favored option carries more 1s on high-validity cues and hence more 'defects', so P(choose it) decreases with its tally margin (negative slope); (2) in Experiment 2, on margin-1 trials where TTB and the tally disagree the two options' inverted values are close together (noise flips the subject onto the tally winner), whereas when they agree the supralinear anti-validity gap is large (the subject reliably anti-follows), yielding p_disagree - p_agree strongly positive; (3) in Experiment 3 P(choose A) rises with the anti-validity weighted margin (positive slope); (4) in Experiment 4 the inverted integrator strongly prefers the tally loser on conflict trials, producing a low tally-following rate. Unlike SCWI's rigid quadratic weight map w_j = -(v_j + tau*v_j^2), the power-law family with gamma ~ 2.2 widens the value gap on TTB/tally-agreement trials (where the tally winner holds the high-validity cues) substantially more than it widens the gap on disagreement trials, which is exactly what Experiment 2's larger observed dissociation (0.2737 vs SCWI's 0.1862) requires, while remaining consistent with Experiments 1, 3 and 4.

`rationale`: PAHI implements the arbiter's prescribed family: additive integration with a comprehension inversion (rating 1 = evidence against the option), a flexible one-parameter power-law weight map |w_j| = v_j^gamma replacing SCWI's rigid quadratic w_j = -(v_j + tau*v_j^2), subject-level heterogeneity, and a softmax-plus-lapse decision rule. (1) Why the power law fixes Experiment 2, the incumbent's dominant failure (SCWI: 0.1862 vs real 0.2737): SCWI's quadratic map is too FLAT at the top, so on TTB/tally-agreement trials (where the tally winner holds the high-validity cues) the anti-validity value gap is too small and p_agree is under-suppressed. A supralinear power (gamma ~ 2.0-2.4) steepens the top-cue contrast, widening the gap exactly on those agreement trials while leaving disagreement trials (whose weighted differences nearly cancel) close to indifference - p_disagree stays near 0.5 while p_agree drops, raising the dissociation toward the observed 0.27. (2) Why Experiment 4 stays fixed: because the power law compresses low-validity weights much more than the quadratic's additive v term, the inverted integrator keeps preferring the tally loser on the conflict probes, so the conflict tally-following rate remains low (~0.16-0.18, matching the observed 0.1625) - unlike a pure tally or TTB mechanism (0.85 / 0.68). (3) Experiments 1 and 3 are structurally unchanged from SCWI (same anti-validity ordering of cues), so the negative Exp-1 slope and positive Exp-3 slope are preserved with comparable magnitudes. (4) Heterogeneity: each subject draws gamma, beta and epsilon independently, which reproduces the substantial between-subject variance (e.g., var = 0.093 in Experiment 2) while the population-average prediction stays on target. (5) Deviation from the arbiter's suggested inversion rate: the arbiter proposed P(inverted) in [0.75, 0.95] with an example of 0.85. I keep the heterogeneous-sign architecture (per-subject s in {-1, +1} via sign_seed) but pin the population inversion rate at 0.99, because the data themselves rule out a large pro-validity subgroup: a pro-validity subject follows the tally winner on ~85% of Experiment 4's conflict trials and contributes roughly -0.35 to Experiment 2's dissociation, so even a 10% pro-validity fraction would push Experiment 4's conflict-following rate above 0.24 (observed: 0.1625) and drag Experiment 2 well below its observed 0.2737. The architecture is retained; only the rate constant is revised upward to be data-consistent. (6) Parameter ranges: gamma in [2.0, 2.4] spans the supralinear region that the four experiments jointly demand (gamma = 1 recovers linear anti-validity, which under-shoots Experiment 2; gamma >= 2.5 flips the near-cancelling Exp-4 probes onto the tally winner and over-shoots Experiment 4); beta in [2.5, 3.9] trades off the deterministic steepness needed for Experiment 2's agreement trials against the moderate steepness Experiments 1 and 3 require; epsilon in [0.05, 0.12] captures residual response noise. The theory is experiment-invariant: one mechanism, no feedback, no experiment-specific machinery, and it adapts to any n_features and validity vector through the symbolic validities parameter.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed PAHI family: additive integration with comprehension inversion (s = -1 for nearly all subjects), a power-law validity weight |w_j| = v_j^gamma replacing SCWI's rigid quadratic, per-subject heterogeneity, and a softmax-plus-lapse decision rule. The one deliberate deviation from the arbiter's suggested P(inverted) in [0.75, 0.95] — pinning it at 0.99 — is well justified by the data (a 10-15% pro-validity subgroup would push Exp-4 conflict-following well above the observed 0.1625), so I do not count that as drift from the family. Fit quality: all four metric SIGNS are correct, and the candidate beats or matches SCWI (pi_3) on three of four experiments (Exp 3: 0.1581 vs 0.1378 against observed 0.1227; Exp 4: 0.1737 vs 0.1608 against observed 0.1625; Exp 1: -0.2283 vs -0.1877 against observed -0.1747). The dominant incumbent failure — Experiment 2, where SCWI under-predicted (0.1862 vs observed 0.2737) — is now fixed in direction but OVER-corrected: the candidate produces 0.3600, overshooting by ~0.086, roughly the same absolute error as SCWI but on the other side. Crucially, the error pattern is SYSTEMATIC: every single metric is too extreme in magnitude (Exp 1 slope too negative by 0.054, Exp 2 dissociation too high by 0.086, Exp 3 slope too positive by 0.035, Exp 4 slightly high by 0.011). This is not noise; it is a single calibration problem — the mechanism is too deterministic/too steep. A second, related mismatch: the candidate's between-subject variances are 5-10x SMALLER than the real data's (Exp 2: var 0.0107 vs observed 0.0930; Exp 1: 0.0007 vs 0.0108), i.e., the simulated population is far too homogeneous relative to real subjects. Both problems point at the same knobs.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED by the gate (loss 0.0872, new running best), and the mechanism family is correct — do NOT re-design. But the fit shows a coherent, fixable mis-calibration, and one more in-family tuning iteration should strictly improve the loss. Two concrete, minor adjustments: (1) SOFTEN the steepness. The systematic overshoot in magnitude on all four metrics means the effective value gap is too large on agreement/extreme trials. Pull gamma down from [2.0, 2.4] toward roughly [1.7, 2.1] (the arbiter's own suggested range started at 1.0; gamma ~ 1.8-1.9 should land Exp 2 near the observed 0.27 while only mildly softening Exp 4, which currently has slack — 0.1737 vs 0.1625 — and where the power law's compression of low-validity cues protects the conflict probes). If lowering gamma alone under-corrects Exp 2, alternatively lower beta from [2.5, 3.9] toward [1.8, 3.0] and/or raise epsilon modestly toward [0.08, 0.18]; these act on all trials roughly uniformly, whereas gamma specifically trades off agreement-trial gap against disagreement-trial near-cancellation, so gamma is the primary lever for the Exp-2 dissociation and beta/epsilon are secondary. Avoid over-shooting back below SCWI's 0.1862 — target the interval [0.24, 0.31]. (2) WIDEN the population heterogeneity to reproduce the between-subject variance. The real data show var ~ 0.09-0.012 on Experiments 1 and 2 while the candidate produces 0.0007-0.011; draw gamma and beta from wider distributions (e.g., gamma sd ~ 0.3-0.5, beta sd ~ 0.8) so per-subject slopes/dissociations spread out to match the observed var. Keep the inversion rate at ~0.99 — that deviation from the arbiter's example was data-driven and correct. Keep everything else (softmax, lapse, additive power-law anti-validity weights, no feedback/history use) unchanged.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0872 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "rationale": "Minimal-diff edit addressing the critic's diagnosis on the ACCEPTED base (loss 0.0872): the mechanism family is correct (all four metric signs right, three of four beats SCWI), but every metric was systematically TOO EXTREME in magnitude (Exp1 -0.2283 vs -0.1747; Exp2 0.3600 vs 0.2737; Exp3 0.1581 vs 0.1227; Exp4 0.1737 vs 0.1625), and the between-subject variances were 5-10x too small (Exp2 var 0.0107 vs 0.0930; Exp1 0.0007 vs 0.0108). Both problems point at the same knobs, so I change ONLY the parameter ranges — the predict/policy code is untouched. (1) SOFTEN the steepness: gamma shifts from [2.0, 2.4] (mean 2.2) to [1.4, 2.4] (mean 1.9), lowering the average supralinear exponent so the anti-validity value gap on TTB/tally-agreement trials narrows; this pulls the Exp-2 dissociation down from 0.36 toward the critic's target interval [0.24, 0.31] while moving Exp 1 toward -0.17, Exp 3 toward 0.12, and Exp 4 toward 0.16 — all in the correct direction, since all four overshoots were signed in the same 'too deterministic' direction. (2) WIDEN heterogeneity to reproduce the between-subject variance: the per-subject parameter draw IS the population distribution, so widening the ranges directly widens the per-subject metric spread. The new gamma range has sd ~0.29 (critic suggested 0.3-0.5) and the new beta range [1.5, 4.0] has sd ~0.72 (critic suggested ~0.8); the broad beta spread in particular makes some subjects near-deterministic and others noisy, which is what generates real var ~0.09 on the Exp-2 dissociation and var ~0.01 on the Exp-1 slope. Epsilon widens modestly to [0.06, 0.20] (mean 0.13 vs 0.085 before), adding a further uniform softening that acts on all trials roughly equally — a secondary lever per the critic, used gently so as not to undo the gamma correction. (3) The inversion rate stays pinned at 0.99 via sign_seed: the critic explicitly endorsed this data-driven deviation from the arbiter's example (a 10-15% pro-validity subgroup would push Exp-4 conflict-following well above the observed 0.1625), so it is retained unchanged. No mechanism changes, no experiment-specific machinery, no history use — one task-invariant power-law anti-validity integrator with softmax-plus-lapse, now calibrated."
