# generation_iter_07_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace PAHI with a new theory, e.g. 'Heterogeneous-Elasticity Anti-Validity Integration (HEAI)': subjects integrate all cues additively with a comprehension inversion (rating of 1 = defect), per-cue anti-weight w_j = -v_j^gamma, where gamma is a free per-subject parameter drawn from a broad, mildly sublinear-to-linear-centered population distribution (approximately gamma ~ 1.15, SD ~ 0.25, truncated to [0.7, 1.7]) — critically with a population mean elasticity BELOW 1.4, outside PAHI's falsified box. Add (i) a guesser subpopulation (~15-20% of subjects with beta ~ 0 and elevated lapse) as in SCWI, (ii) a continuum of inverse temperatures beta spanning ~0.5-6 with a heavy right tail, and (iii) a symmetric lapse epsilon in [0.03, 0.25]. This combination reproduces: kill composites of ~0.60-0.66 on Experiments 1/2/7/8 (majority of subjects with gamma < ~1.35 follow the high-validity stack, guessers dilute toward 0.5, steep-gamma tail dilutes slightly below SCWI's 0.65-0.71 — matching the observed 0.60-0.68 and the larger observed variances); the Exp 4 dissociation near 0.27 (heterogeneous beta/gamma produces the observed large between-subject variance of ~0.09 that SCWI's three-regime mixture underpredicts); and the Exp 3/5/6 slopes and conflict rates near the observed values. The new theory differs from PAHI primarily by relocating the population elasticity from the falsified [1.4, 2.4] range to the empirically supported near-linear range, and differs from SCWI by replacing the fixed three-regime (guesser/mid/deterministic) mixture with a continuous per-subject heterogeneity in the weight-map shape itself, which is the lever needed to capture the residual gaps (overpredicted kill composites, underpredicted Exp 4 dissociation and between-subject variance) without disturbing the signs that SCWI gets right.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.920)

**Description**
Signed-Cue Weighted Integration (SCWI). When choosing between two options described by binary expert ratings, subjects do not use a lexicographic cascade (TTB) and do not merely count wins (Tallying). Instead they integrate ALL cues additively into a single subjective value per option — but the mapping from a rating to evidence carries a systematic SIGN INVERSION: a rating of 1 is treated as a defect/criticism rather than an endorsement (a comprehension inversion of the rating direction). Moreover, the inversion is not uniform across cues: the subjective weight of cue j is w_j = -(v_j + tau * v_j^2), i.e. an anti-validity weighting that grows SUPRALINEARLY with the instructed validity — the endorsements of the most trusted experts are avoided most strongly, while low-validity experts are nearly ignored (their anti-weight is small in magnitude). The option with the higher (less negative) signed value is preferred, with softmax noise (inverse temperature beta) and an independent lapse (epsilon) capturing response variability. This single task-invariant mechanism predicts both experimental signatures simultaneously: in Experiment 1, the top-cue-favored option carries more 1s and hence more 'defects', so P(choose the top-cue-favored option) DECREASES with its tally margin (negative slope); in Experiment 2, on margin-1 trials where TTB and the tally disagree the two options' signed values are close together (so noise frequently flips the subject onto the tally winner), whereas when they agree the value gap is large (so the subject reliably anti-follows) — yielding p_disagree > p_agree, a positive metric.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.388)

**Description**
Power-Law Anti-Validity Integration with Heterogeneous Inversion (PAHI). Subjects integrate all cues additively into a per-option subjective value, but a rating of 1 is treated as evidence AGAINST the option (comprehension inversion, s = -1 for ~99% of subjects). The anti-weight of cue j is a free power law of the instructed validity, |w_j| = v_j^gamma, with gamma a free per-subject parameter drawn from a heterogeneous population distribution (gamma ~ 1.4-2.4, mildly supralinear on average). Choice is a softmax over beta * s * sum_j v_j^gamma * rating_j with a symmetric lapse epsilon. Because gamma, beta, and epsilon are drawn broadly per subject, the population reproduces both the mean-level signatures (negative Exp-1 slope, positive Exp-2 dissociation, positive Exp-3 slope, low Exp-4 conflict-following) and the large between-subject variance seen in the real data.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0760 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0694 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0671 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0815 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.1263 -> REJECTED
- iter 6: loss=0.0701 -> REJECTED
- iter 7: loss=0.0717 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0671 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

    D > 0 means option A carries fewer/smaller anti-validity 'defects'

    (~0.2-0.3 with beta in [1.1,1.7], epsilon in [0.05,0.15]).
    Tallying cannot produce a positive slope: on count-tied trials

    all remaining trials its choice probability tracks the raw count
    margin, which is strongly ANTI-correlated with D across this design
    (the tally winner is almost always the weighted-margin loser). So

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # Kill-composite: fraction of choices falling on the HIGH-validity stack
    # across the parameter-free sign-kill trials of this design.
    #
    # Kill trials pit a endorsements on higher-validity cues against b
    # endorsements on lower-validity cues (all other cues 0 for both
    # options, disjoint supports, each stack within one validity block)
    # at count ratios that lie strictly between the two theories'
    # weight-ratio windows:
    #   5 x 0.90 vs 7 x 0.70   (r = 1.40)
    #   9 x 0.70 vs 14 x 0.50  (r = 1.556)
    #   5 x 0.90 vs 11 x 0.50  (r = 2.20)
    # SCWI's ratio window w(v_h)/w(v_l) is BELOW each r for every admissible
    # tau, so SCWI always prefers the high-validity stack. PAHI's power-law
    # window is ABOVE each r for every admissible gamma, so PAHI always
    # prefers the low-validity stack. The metric is the fraction of kill
    # trials on which the subject chose the high-validity stack; mirrored
    # versions of each kill pair absorb side bias. It is well defined on
    # the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject slice (18 kill trials
    # per subject: 6 unique kill pairs x 3 repetitions).

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Heterogeneous-Elasticity Anti-Validity Integration (HEAI), bimodal-population refinement. Subjects integrate ALL expert ratings additively into a per-option subjective value, but a rating of 1 is comprehended as a DEFECT (evidence against the option) — a sign inversion of the rating direction. The anti-weight of expert j is a per-subject power law of the instructed validity, w_j = -v_j^gamma, where gamma ('validity elasticity') is drawn from a BIMODAL continuous population: a shallow majority (75% of engaged subjects, gamma ~ N(1.04, 0.22) truncated [0.60, 1.42]) that sits cleanly below the kill-design count-ratio thresholds (~1.31-1.34) and therefore follows the high-validity stack, and a steep minority (25% of engaged subjects, gamma ~ N(2.10, 0.26) truncated [1.65, 2.75]) that sits cleanly above them, whose near-lexicographic top-cue dominance drives the Exp-2 dissociation and keeps the Exp-8/Exp-4 composites from overshooting. Inverse temperature is mode-linked (shallow: lognormal median ~2.6; steep: lognormal median ~3.3; both heavy-tailed), a 16% guesser subpopulation (beta ~ 0) and a symmetric lapse epsilon are retained unchanged. The population mean elasticity (~1.30) stays below the arbiter's 1.4 ceiling. The key change from the falsified wide-unimodal shape is that almost no mass is wasted in the ambiguous 1.2-1.6 band where subjects sit at chance on the diagnostic cells: the shallow mode's thin upper shoulder (1.32-1.42) is retained deliberately, because subjects just above the kill thresholds miss Exp 8 while still hitting the higher-threshold Exp 5/7 ladder cells — the lever that lets Exp 8's mean and variance stay calibrated without capping Exp 5/6/7.

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # Heterogeneous-Elasticity Anti-Validity Integration (HEAI), iter 3.
    # Stimulus: array-like of shape (2, n_features); row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B; entries are binary expert ratings.
    # Mechanism (UNCHANGED from the accepted iter-2 base): every cue
    # contributes signed evidence w_j = -v_j**gamma per unit rating
    # (a rating of 1 is a defect; the anti-weight is a per-subject
    # power law of the instructed validity). Choice is a numerically
    # stable softmax over beta * option values, mixed with a symmetric
    # lapse epsilon. History is ignored (no trial-by-trial feedback).
    #
    # Population edits on top of the accepted iter-2 base (mechanism
    # untouched), implementing the iter-2 critic's diagnosis that a
    # wide UNIMODAL gamma dumps its spread into the ambiguous
    # threshold band (gamma ~ 1.2-1.6) where subjects sit at ~chance
    # on every diagnostic cell, capping the means on BOTH sides:
    #   * GAMMA MADE BIMODAL: the engaged population is now a mixture
    #     of a SHALLOW majority (75%: N(1.04, 0.22) trunc [0.60, 1.42])
    #     and a STEEP minority (25%: N(2.10, 0.26) trunc [1.65, 2.75]),
    #     with minimal mass in between. The shallow mode sits cleanly
    #     below the kill-design count-ratio thresholds (~1.31-1.34 on
    #     Exp 8; ~1.32+ on the Exp 5 ladder), so it drives high-stack
    #     adherence on Exp 5/6/7/8; its thin upper shoulder (1.32-1.42,
    #     ~10% of the mode) deliberately remains to keep Exp 8's mean
    #     and between-subject variance calibrated. The steep mode sits
    #     cleanly above ~1.8 (critic's prescription; extends to 2.75 so
    #     the top cue can dominate three lower cues), which is what
    #     lifts the Exp 2 dissociation mean/variance and holds Exp 4
    #     down. Population mean elasticity ~ 1.30 < 1.4 (arbiter box).
    #   * BETA MODE-LINKED AND HOTTER: shallow subjects draw lognormal
    #     beta, median exp(0.95) ~ 2.6 (up from ~2.3), sigma 0.70,
    #     clip [0.6, 7.0]; steep subjects draw a hotter lognormal,
    #     median exp(1.20) ~ 3.3, sigma 0.60, clip [1.2, 8.0] (the
    #     steep 'confident lexicographic' subjects are also the
    #     sharpest). Hotter shallow beta sharpens engaged adherence on
    #     Exp 5/6/7; hotter steep beta maximizes the Exp 2 contribution
    #     per steep subject while pushing steep Exp 8/Exp 4 hits down.
    #   * Guesser fraction (16%), epsilon ranges, seeds, and everything
    #     else are untouched.

`rationale`: This is a distribution-only edit of the ACCEPTED iter-2 HEAI base (mechanism, guesser fraction, epsilon ranges, seeds, and code structure unchanged), implementing the iter-2 critic's diagnosis — whose iter-1 advice produced an ACCEPTED loss improvement, so its model of the metrics deserves weight. The critic showed that the wide unimodal N(1.12, 0.40) dumps its added spread into the ambiguous gamma ~ 1.2-1.6 band, where subjects sit at ~chance on every diagnostic cell: that raised variances (as predicted) but capped the means on both sides simultaneously — Exp 5 fell 0.567 -> 0.531 against 0.684, Exp 2 stayed stuck at 0.130 against 0.274, and the 1.8 truncation cap made top-cue dominance on Exp 2's margin-1 cells structurally impossible. The edit: (1) GAMMA MADE BIMODAL with minimal middle mass — a shallow majority (75% of engaged, N(1.04, 0.22) trunc [0.60, 1.42]) cleanly below the kill thresholds (~1.31-1.34), and a steep minority (25%, N(2.10, 0.26) trunc [1.65, 2.75]) cleanly above ~1.8 and extending toward the gamma ~ 2-3 range the critic identified as necessary for Exp 2. Mixture arithmetic on the established simulation anchors (PAHI's all-steep population: Exp 2 = 0.267, Exp 8 = 0.208; iter-2's shallow population: Exp 2 = 0.130, Exp 8 = 0.622) predicts Exp 2 rises to ~0.20-0.22 while Exp 8 holds near 0.62 — the steep minority is precisely the mass that lowers Exp 8 from shallow's overshoot region while lifting Exp 2. (2) The shallow mode's thin upper shoulder (1.32-1.42, ~10% of the mode) is retained deliberately: subjects just above the kill thresholds miss Exp 8 but still hit the higher-threshold Exp 5/7 ladder cells (flip points 1.58-2.07), which is what reconciles Exp 8's lower target mean (0.604) with Exp 5/6/7's higher ones (0.63-0.68) — a reconciliation neither a clean bimodal nor the old unimodal could achieve. (3) BETA MODE-LINKED AND HOTTER (shallow median 2.3 -> ~2.6; steep median ~3.3, both heavy-tailed): hotter shallow beta sharpens engaged adherence on Exp 5/6/7 (the pi_3_1 vs pi_3 contrast shows hot beta is the lever that lifted Exp 5 from 0.553 to 0.651), and hotter steep beta maximizes each steep subject's Exp 2 dissociation contribution while pushing steep Exp 8/Exp 4 hits toward the floor. Expected net movement vs iter-2: Exp 2 0.130 -> ~0.21, Exp 5 0.531 -> ~0.59, Exp 6 0.564 -> ~0.63, Exp 4 0.199 -> ~0.18, with Exp 1/3/8 approximately held and Exp 7 giving back ~0.03-0.05 (the one deliberate trade, repurchased many times over on Exp 2/5/6). Bimodality also widens the between-subject variance on the kill composites (Exp 6/7 variances move toward the observed 0.04-0.07). The population mean elasticity (~1.30) remains below the arbiter's 1.4 ceiling, all population structure continues to be derived inside predict from uniform seeds, and the declared parameter boxes are untouched — the candidate stays squarely inside the prescribed HEAI family while replacing the falsified unimodal shape with the separated-subpopulation structure the data demand.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: HEAI is a faithful implementation of the arbiter's prescribed family (additive anti-validity integration, per-subject power-law elasticity with population mean below 1.4, guesser subpopulation, heavy-tailed beta, symmetric lapse), and it was accepted by the gate. The signs are right everywhere: Exp 1 slope (-0.168 vs -0.175), Exp 3 slope (0.108 vs 0.123), Exp 4 conflict-following (0.196 vs 0.163), Exp 7 (0.599 vs 0.646), Exp 8 kill composite (0.627 vs 0.604). However, there is a systematic residual pattern across the suite: (a) Exp 2 dissociation is badly underpredicted in both mean (0.133 vs 0.274) and especially between-subject variance (0.013 vs 0.093 — a 7x gap); (b) Exp 5 adherence is underpredicted (0.567 vs 0.684) and Exp 6 mildly so (0.565 vs 0.630); (c) between-subject variance is underpredicted by roughly 2-3x on Exp 5 (0.024 vs 0.064), Exp 6 (0.034 vs 0.070) and Exp 8 (0.037 vs 0.065). The diagnosis is that the heterogeneity in the weight-map shape is not wide enough: with gamma ~ N(1.15, 0.25) truncated [0.7, 1.7], roughly three quarters of engaged subjects cluster in a narrow band around the kill-design count-ratio thresholds (~1.31-1.34 on Exp 8; ~1.32 on the (2, 5x0.5) Exp-5 ladder cell; ~0.81 on the (4, 7x0.5) Exp-5 cell), so most subjects sit on the same side of each threshold and the population behaves too homogeneously. The (4-perfect-cues vs 7x0.5) cells in Exp 5 are the clearest single failure: the flip threshold is gamma ~ 0.81, so nearly all engaged subjects (gamma > 0.81) abandon the high-validity stack there, dragging the Exp 5 composite down to 0.567 where humans show 0.684.
Rationale: The candidate is in-family and accepted, but the fit leaves large, systematic, and mechanically diagnosable gaps that can be closed with parameter-distribution adjustments inside the prescribed HEAI family — no mechanism change needed. Concretely: (1) WIDEN the gamma distribution: raise the SD from 0.25 to roughly 0.35-0.45 and extend the truncation range to approximately [0.6, 1.8], keeping the mean near 1.10-1.15 (still safely below the arbiter's 1.4 ceiling). This is the single lever that addresses the dominant failure — between-subject variance underprediction on Exp 2/5/6/8 — because it spreads subjects across both sides of every count-ratio threshold instead of clustering them just below it. Back-of-envelope: with SD ~0.4, P(gamma < 0.81) ~ 0.19 recovers top-stack following on the Exp-5 (4, 7x0.5) cells, P(gamma < 1.32) ~ 0.67 keeps the Exp-8 composite near 0.60-0.63 (currently well calibrated at 0.627 — do NOT reduce the guesser fraction or epsilon, which would push Exp 8 and Exp 4 too high), and the wider spread should lift the Exp 5 composite toward ~0.65-0.69 and roughly double the kill-metric variances. (2) Modestly hotter beta: raise the lognormal median from ~1.9 toward ~2.3-2.8 while keeping the heavy right tail and the [0.5, 6] clip. This sharpens engaged subjects' adherence on Exp 5/6/7 (means currently 0.04-0.12 too low) and simultaneously pulls the Exp 4 conflict-following rate down from 0.196 toward the observed 0.163 (hotter anti-validity integration means less tally-following on conflict probes). Watch Exp 1: the slope may become slightly more negative (currently -0.168 vs real -0.175; pi_3_1's steeper variants reach -0.22), so if it overshoots, compensate via the gamma widening rather than cooling beta. (3) The Exp 2 variance gap (0.013 vs 0.093) should be attacked primarily through the gamma widening — subjects near the bottom of the widened range (gamma ~ 0.6-0.8) have nearly flat anti-weights and behave tally-like, producing strongly positive per-subject dissociation, while steep-gamma subjects sit near zero — exactly the bimodality-in-continuous-form the real variance implies. If after widening, the Exp 2 mean is still short of ~0.27, allow the gamma lower bound to extend slightly further down (toward 0.5) rather than adding any new mechanism. All of these are distribution-shape recalibrations of the exact knobs the arbiter prescribed (gamma population, beta population, guesser fraction, lapse), so the candidate remains squarely inside the HEAI family.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0760 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0694 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-2 candidate is faithful to the prescribed HEAI family (mechanism untouched, mean elasticity 1.12 < 1.4, guessers 16%, heavy-tailed beta, symmetric lapse) and the gate accepted it (loss 0.0760 -> 0.0694). My iter-1 advice was partially validated: between-subject variances moved substantially toward the real values on Exp 5 (0.024 -> 0.042 vs 0.064), Exp 6 (0.034 -> 0.039 vs 0.070), Exp 8 (0.037 -> 0.068 vs 0.065, now essentially exact), and Exp 7's mean is now spot-on (0.648 vs 0.646). Exp 1 (-0.179 vs -0.175), Exp 3 (0.127 vs 0.123), and Exp 8 (0.622 vs 0.604) are all in excellent shape. HOWEVER, the widening backfired on exactly the mean it was supposed to fix: Exp 5 dropped from 0.567 to 0.531 against an observed 0.684, Exp 6 is flat at 0.564 vs 0.630, Exp 2 is stuck at 0.130 vs 0.274 (variance 0.018 vs 0.093, still a 5x gap), and Exp 4 drifted the wrong way (0.196 -> 0.199 vs 0.163). The mechanical reason is now clear: a wide UNIMODAL gamma centered at 1.12 dumps its added spread into the threshold band (gamma ~ 1.2-1.6), which is exactly where subjects sit at chance on the diagnostic cells. The Exp 5 included cells flip at gamma ~ 1.32/1.58/1.81/2.0 and the Exp 6 cells at ~1.17-1.48; subjects in the middle band contribute ~0.5 everywhere, which raises variance (as I predicted) but caps the means on BOTH sides simultaneously. Meanwhile the hard truncation cap at gamma = 1.8 makes TTB-like behavior on Exp 2's margin-1 cells structurally impossible (the top cue there needs gamma ~ 2-3 to dominate three lower cues), which is why Exp 2 never moved despite two rounds of tuning. The data demand SEPARATED subpopulations: a shallow majority cleanly below ~1.2 (drives Exp 5/6/8 top-stack adherence and the Exp 8 high-stack composite) and a steep minority cleanly above ~1.8 (drives the Exp 2 dissociation mean/variance and the low Exp 4 conflict-following rate) — with as little mass as possible wasted in the ambiguous middle. The current unimodal shape cannot deliver both; a bimodal continuous population can.
Rationale: verdict=regenerate

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0694 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0671 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-3 bimodal edit was accepted (loss 0.0694 -> 0.0671) and my iter-2 diagnosis was validated in its main predictions: Exp 2 rose 0.130 -> 0.195 (target 0.274), Exp 6 0.564 -> 0.591 (target 0.630) with variance now essentially exact (0.073 vs 0.070), and Exp 8 held at 0.591 (target 0.604). Exp 1 (-0.167 vs -0.175) and Exp 3 (0.133 vs 0.123) remain excellent. The separated-subpopulation structure is clearly the right shape. However, four systematic gaps remain, and they are jointly diagnosable: (1) Exp 5 is stuck at 0.570 vs 0.684 — the worst mean gap in the suite. The mechanism is identifiable: of the 14 included trials, 2 flip at gamma ~ 0.585 ((2 vs 3x0.5) cells) and 2 flip at gamma ~ 0.81 ((4 perfect vs 7x0.5) cells); with the shallow mode at N(1.04, 0.22), only ~0.2% and ~15% of shallow subjects fall below those thresholds, so nearly the entire engaged population abandons the high-validity stack on 4 of 14 trials. pi_3_1 (a shallower population) reaches 0.651 on this metric — the shallow mode is simply not shallow enough. (2) Exp 2 mean is still 0.08 short and its variance is 0.027 vs 0.093 — a 3.4x gap that mixture arithmetic pins on the steep mode being too small and/or not extreme enough per-subject (the proposer's own anchors: shallow population ~0.13, all-steep ~0.267; with 25% steep the mixture saturates near 0.20). (3) Exp 4 drifted the WRONG way, 0.199 -> 0.230 vs target 0.163. The culprit is the shallow-beta hike (median 2.3 -> 2.6): at gamma ~1.0 the anti-weights over Exp 4's validities [1.0, 0.95, 0.65, 0.5x3] are nearly flat, so a hot shallow subject follows the raw tally near-deterministically on the conflict probes. My iter-1 suggestion of beta ~2.3-2.8 overshot; the shallow median needs to come back down. (4) Exp 7 gave back its iter-2 spot-on fit (0.648 -> 0.593 vs 0.646), consistent with the shallow mode narrowing and centering at 1.04 — lower-gamma mass is what follows SCWI's high-validity stack on those cells.
Rationale: regenerate — but this is a small-step distribution recalibration on top of the accepted iter-3 base, not a redesign; the bimodal architecture should be kept. Three coordinated edits, all inside the prescribed HEAI family: (1) LOWER THE SHALLOW MODE CENTER from 1.04 to ~0.87-0.92 (keep SD ~0.22-0.25 and the thin upper shoulder to ~1.42). This is the single biggest lever: it puts ~35-45% of shallow subjects below the 0.81 threshold that governs the (4, 7x0.5) Exp-5 cells and some mass below 0.585, lifting Exp 5 from 0.570 toward 0.65+; it simultaneously raises Exp 7 back toward 0.646 (lower gamma = more SCWI-like on those cells) and nudges Exp 8 up from 0.591 toward 0.604 (kill thresholds 1.31-1.34, more mass below them). Watch Exp 3 (may dip slightly from 0.133 toward 0.123 — fine) and Exp 1 (may drift toward -0.15; accept a small miss there rather than re-heating beta). (2) RAISE THE STEEP FRACTION from 25% to ~32-35% of engaged, and consider centering the steep mode slightly higher (~2.2-2.4) so per-subject dissociation is more extreme. This attacks the two largest remaining gaps at once: Exp 2 mean (mixture arithmetic: 0.55*0.13 + 0.30*0.7 + 0.16*0 ≈ 0.27, on target) and especially Exp 2 variance (~0.07-0.08 vs the observed 0.093 — the steep pocket is the only variance source big enough), while pulling Exp 4 back DOWN toward 0.163 (steep subjects' integrators strongly prefer the tally loser, offsetting the shallow mode's tally-following). The cost on Exp 5/6/8 is small (the steep mode contributes little to those composites) and is more than repaid by edit (1). (3) COOL THE SHALLOW BETA back to a lognormal median ~2.2-2.4 (keep the heavy tail and clip). My iter-1 push toward 2.3-2.8 overshot on Exp 4: at near-flat weights, hotter shallow beta means MORE tally-following on the conflict probes, which is why Exp 4 rose 0.199 -> 0.230. Keep the steep beta hot (median ~3.3) — that is what maximizes each steep subject's Exp-2 contribution. Net expected movement: Exp 5 0.570 -> ~0.65, Exp 2 0.195 -> ~0.26 with var 0.027 -> ~0.07, Exp 4 0.230 -> ~0.17, Exp 7 0.593 -> ~0.64, with Exp 1/3/6/8 approximately held. One process note: before committing, verify the Exp-4 and Exp-1 side effects of each edit separately — this round showed that the beta hike and the gamma re-centering interact, and the proposer's a-priori mixture arithmetic under-predicted the Exp-4 regression. The population mean elasticity (~1.2 after these edits) stays below the arbiter's 1.4 ceiling, and no mechanism, guesser fraction, or lapse change is involved.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0671 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0815 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-4 candidate was REJECTED by the gate (loss 0.0671 -> 0.0815), so my iter-3 advice must be judged a failure and I will not repeat it. The per-experiment decomposition shows exactly why. The three coordinated edits interacted destructively: (a) raising the steep fraction from 25% to 33% of engaged subjects added ~8 percentage points of subjects who sit on the ANTI-SCWI side of the Exp-5/6/7 diagnostic cells (steep gamma > ~1.8 prefers the low-validity stack wherever SCWI prefers the high stack), dragging Exp 5 from 0.570 down to 0.517 (target 0.684), Exp 6 from 0.591 to 0.553 (target 0.630), and Exp 7 from 0.593 to 0.547 (target 0.646); (b) cooling the shallow beta (2.6 -> 2.3) softened shallow adherence everywhere, compounding those mean drops and pushing between-subject variances on Exp 5/6/7/8 well ABOVE their targets (0.107/0.101/0.095/0.099 vs 0.064/0.070/0.040/0.065); (c) the edit that was supposed to pay for all this — the steep enlargement lifting Exp 2 — did NOT materialize: Exp 2 is exactly unchanged (0.1950, var 0.026 vs targets 0.274, 0.093). The mixture arithmetic failed because the two other edits cancelled it: lowering the shallow mode 1.04 -> 0.89 flattens shallow weights and erodes the shallow subjects' own positive dissociation contribution (~-0.03), offsetting the +0.04 expected from the larger steep pocket. The good news in the wreckage: Exp 1 (-0.177 vs -0.175) and Exp 3 (0.124 vs 0.123) are essentially perfect, Exp 4 moved in the right direction (0.230 -> 0.212 toward 0.163), confirming the shallow-beta-cooling diagnosis, and the bimodal architecture itself remains validated (it produced the only accepted gains in this loop). The failure was in which knobs were turned, not in the family.
Rationale: verdict=regenerate. The base is the accepted iter-3 candidate; the next edit should be a DIFFERENT set of levers than the rejected iter-4 ones (do not re-lower the shallow mode to 0.89, do not re-raise the steep fraction to 33%). The suite's two stubborn gaps need to be attacked through per-subject extremity of the steep mode and lapse calibration, not through mixture proportions: (1) REVERT the steep fraction to ~25% of engaged (this alone should recover most of the Exp 5/6/7 mean drop) and keep the shallow mode in the 0.95-1.05 band with truncation roughly [0.70, 1.42] — the iter-4 widening down to 0.55 is what exploded the variances past their targets. (2) Attack the Exp-2 gap (mean 0.195 vs 0.274, var 0.026 vs 0.093) via PER-STEEP extremity instead of steep mass: on Exp-2's margin-1 cells the steep subject's evidence margins are small (~0.15-0.3 in weight units), so at steep beta median 3.3 the per-subject follow probability is only sigmoid(~0.5-0.9) ~ 0.62-0.71 — far from saturated. Raise the steep beta lognormal median from ~3.3 to ~5-6 and widen its clip to ~10-12; optionally center the steep gamma slightly higher (~2.3-2.5) with truncation extended up to ~3.2. This raises each steep subject's dissociation toward its ceiling, lifting both the Exp-2 mean and (critically) the between-subject variance, while the 25% fraction keeps the Exp-5/6/7 cost at its iter-3 level. (3) Tighten the steep lapse: draw epsilon for steep subjects from ~[0.03, 0.08] instead of the shared [0.03, 0.17] — lapse directly caps per-subject |dissociation| and is a pure variance/mean amplifier for the steep pocket. (4) Modest adherence lift for Exp 5/6/7 that does NOT reheat the shallow beta (which iter 3 proved raises Exp 4): tighten the shallow epsilon upper bound from 0.17 to ~0.12, and optionally trim the guesser fraction from 16% to ~15% (bottom of the arbiter's prescribed 15-20% band). (5) Keep the shallow beta at the cooled ~2.3-2.4 median — the Exp-4 movement 0.230 -> 0.212 confirmed that direction; the steeper/hotter steep mode from (2) should pull Exp 4 the rest of the way toward 0.163 since steep integrators anti-follow the tally on the conflict probes. Process discipline: test edits (2) and (1)+(4) separately before combining — this round demonstrated that the shallow-gamma, steep-fraction, and beta levers interact, and the a-priori mixture arithmetic under-predicts the Exp-4/5 side effects. All changes are distribution-shape recalibrations inside the prescribed HEAI family (additive anti-validity power-law integration, bimodal continuous gamma with population mean ~1.2 < 1.4, guesser subpopulation, heavy-tailed beta, symmetric lapse); no mechanism change is proposed.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0815 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.1263 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-5 candidate was REJECTED (loss 0.0671 -> 0.1263), so my iter-4 advice — whose central lever was 'steep extremity, not steep mass' — must be judged a failure. The per-experiment decomposition shows the steep-extremity hypothesis was wrong in its core prediction and destructive in its side effects. (1) The Exp-2 lever did not work: Exp 2 fell from 0.1950 to 0.1575 (target 0.274) and its between-subject variance did not move (0.023 vs target 0.093). The claim that saturating steep subjects' beta would push each steep subject's dissociation toward its ceiling is falsified at gamma ~ 2.3 — the saturated per-subject dissociation of the steep integrator is evidently not large (the disagree-cell flip thresholds in that design run well above 2.3, some as high as ~4-5), so heating beta saturates a weak signal rather than amplifying it. (2) The same heating saturated the steep pocket's ANTI-SCWI stance everywhere else: Exp 5 crashed 0.570 -> 0.496 (target 0.684), Exp 6 0.591 -> 0.450 (target 0.630), Exp 7 0.593 -> 0.481 (target 0.646), Exp 8 0.591 -> 0.556 (target 0.604), with variances on 6/7/8 overshooting their targets (0.098/0.087/0.113 vs 0.070/0.040/0.065). On the Exp-5/6/7 diagnostic cells the steep subjects' evidence margins are LARGE, so beta ~5.5 turned them from partially lapse-diluted (~0.35-0.40 contribution) into near-deterministic low-stack choosers (~0.05-0.10 contribution) — a ~0.07-0.14 composite cost paid by 21% of the population. (3) The shallow lower-truncation tightening (0.60 -> 0.70) compounded the Exp-5 damage by deleting the most SCWI-adherent shallow subjects (those below the 0.81 flip threshold). The only unambiguous win is Exp 4: 0.230 -> 0.175 (target 0.163), confirming for the second time that cooling the shallow beta (2.6 -> 2.3) pulls conflict-probe tally-following down. Exp 1 (-0.180 vs -0.175) and Exp 3 (0.140 vs 0.123) remain essentially fine. Net: the iter-5 edits traded ~0.08-0.14 losses on four experiments for a 0.055 gain on one — a bad trade, and the gate correctly discarded it. The base remains iter-3.
Rationale: verdict=regenerate. Two consecutive rejections mean the next edit must be small, isolated, and built only from levers with demonstrated signs. The candidate should return to the iter-3 configuration and change exactly three things: (1) FULLY REVERT the steep pocket to its iter-3 values — beta lognormal median ~3.3 with clip [1.2, 8.0], gamma ~ N(2.10, 0.26) truncated [1.65, 2.75], steep lapse back to the shared [0.03, 0.17]. The iter-5 result shows that any steep-pocket extremity edit has large, unanticipated anti-SCWI side effects on Experiments 5/6/7/8 that swamp whatever it does on Exp 2; do not touch the steep pocket's beta, gamma center, truncation, or lapse this round. (2) KEEP the shallow beta cooled to a lognormal median ~2.3-2.4 — this is the one lever validated twice (Exp 4: 0.230 -> 0.212 -> 0.175, target 0.163). (3) KEEP the shallow lapse tightened to [0.03, 0.12] and the shallow lower truncation at 0.60 (NOT 0.70 — the iter-5 tightening deleted the sub-0.81 shallow subjects that carry Exp-5 adherence; the iter-4 variance explosion came from widening to 0.55, not from holding 0.60). Optionally, take one SMALL step in the previously rejected direction: lower the shallow mode center from 1.04 to ~0.98-1.00 (SD 0.22 unchanged) — iter-4's failure at 0.89 was confounded with the 33% steep fraction and the 0.55 truncation, and a half-step puts meaningfully more shallow mass below the 0.81 threshold that governs the (4-perfect vs 7x0.5) Exp-5 cells, the suite's largest mean gap (0.570 vs 0.684). Keep the guesser fraction at 15%. Expected net vs iter-3: Exp 4 ~0.21, Exp 5 ~0.58-0.60, Exp 6/7 at or slightly above their iter-3 values, Exp 1/2/3/8 approximately held — a modest but real loss reduction. Process discipline: change nothing else; the iter-4 and iter-5 failures both came from bundling interacting edits whose a-priori arithmetic under-predicted cross-experiment side effects. For the iteration AFTER this one, the structural problem to attack in isolation is the Exp-2 variance (0.027 vs 0.093): mixture arithmetic shows the target (mean 0.274, var 0.093) requires a ~20%-of-population pocket with per-subject dissociation near 0.85, and inside this family that likely requires gamma well ABOVE 3 (the disagree-cell flip thresholds in that design extend to ~4-5), i.e., a small hyper-steep pocket at gamma ~3.5-5 with hot beta, tested alone against its certain cost on the Exp-8 kill composite — but only once the conservative revert above has re-established an accepted base. All changes remain distribution-shape recalibrations inside the prescribed HEAI family (additive anti-validity power-law integration, bimodal continuous gamma with population mean below 1.4, guesser subpopulation, heavy-tailed beta, symmetric lapse); no mechanism change is proposed.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.1263 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.0701 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 6
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-6 candidate executed my iter-5 conservative-revert prescription faithfully (steep pocket byte-identical to iter-3, shallow beta cooled 2.59->2.34, shallow lapse tightened to [0.03, 0.12], shallow center half-stepped down 1.04->0.99, guesser 15%), and the loss recovered from the iter-5 catastrophe (0.1263 -> 0.0701) — but it landed just ABOVE the accepted iter-3 base (0.0671) and was REJECTED. The per-experiment decomposition shows a clean, diagnosable trade: the edits that worked were Exp 4 (0.230 -> 0.153 vs target 0.163 — now the suite's best-fitting experiment, gap -0.009), Exp 5 (0.570 -> 0.580, still -0.104 short), and Exp 2 variance (0.027 -> 0.033, still 3x below 0.093). The edits that backfired were Exp 7 (0.593 -> 0.549 vs target 0.646) and Exp 8 (0.591 -> 0.630 vs target 0.604, now overshooting). The mechanism of the backfire is identifiable: Exp 7's diagnostic cells have SMALL evidence margins for shallow subjects, so the shallow-beta cooling (2.59 -> 2.34) softened exactly the adherence Exp 7 measures; Exp 8's kill cells have LARGE margins, so beta cooling was inert there and the center-down (more mass below the 1.31-1.34 kill thresholds) plus the lapse tightening and guesser trim dominated, pushing the composite past its target. In other words, the shallow-beta lever has now been scanned at three values with a consistent picture: 2.6 -> Exp 4 too high (0.230) but Exp 7 fine (0.593); 2.34 -> Exp 4 perfect (0.153) but Exp 7 crashes (0.549). The optimum is between them. Everything else in the iter-6 configuration behaved as predicted, and Exp 1 (-0.180 vs -0.175) and Exp 3 (0.140 vs 0.123) remain essentially fine.
Rationale: verdict=regenerate (the gate already rejected this candidate at 0.0701 vs 0.0671, so 'continue' would be moot regardless). The candidate is in-family, faithful to the arbiter's HEAI prescription, and only 0.003 loss away from the accepted base — this is a one-knob recalibration, not a redesign. Next round, build on the ACCEPTED iter-3 base and change essentially ONE thing: (1) RE-HEAT THE SHALLOW BETA to the midpoint of the two flanking iterations — lognormal median exp(0.93) ~ 2.53 (between iter-3's 2.59 and iter-6's 2.34), sigma and clip unchanged. I am explicitly avoiding an oscillation here: iter-3 at 2.59 left Exp 4 at 0.230; iter-6 at 2.34 fixed Exp 4 (0.153) but crashed Exp 7 (0.549). The margin structure says the midpoint should land Exp 4 near ~0.18-0.19 (still far better than iter-3's 0.230) while recovering Exp 7 toward ~0.59 and Exp 6 toward ~0.59 — a net loss reduction on both flanks. (2) HOLD everything else at the iter-6 values: shallow center 0.99 (SD 0.22, truncation [0.60, 1.42]), shallow lapse [0.03, 0.12], guesser 15%, steep pocket untouched at iter-3 values. The Exp-8 overshoot (+0.026) is the accepted price of the Exp-5 gain from the lower center — Exp 5's gap (-0.104) is the suite's largest and outweighs it; if a trim proves necessary, prefer raising the guesser fraction to 16% over moving the shallow center, since the center is what carries the Exp-5 (4-perfect vs 7x0.5) cells. (3) DO NOT touch the steep pocket and DO NOT bundle any additional edits — iters 4 and 5 were both rejected for bundling interacting levers whose a-priori mixture arithmetic under-predicted cross-experiment side effects, and this round's near-miss confirms the small-isolated-edit discipline. (4) For the iteration AFTER a re-acceptance, the priority remains the structural Exp-2 problem (mean 0.183 vs 0.274, variance 0.033 vs 0.093): per my iter-5 process note, test in ISOLATION a small hyper-steep pocket (gamma ~ 3.5-5, hot beta) at perhaps 8-12% of engaged subjects — the disagree-cell flip thresholds in that design extend to ~4-5, which is why both the 25%-at-2.1 and the heated-2.3 attempts saturated a weak signal — weighed against its certain cost on the Exp-8 kill composite. All proposed changes are distribution-shape recalibrations inside the prescribed HEAI family (additive anti-validity power-law integration, bimodal continuous gamma with population mean ~1.27 < 1.4, guesser subpopulation, heavy-tailed beta, symmetric lapse); no mechanism change is proposed.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.0701 -> iter 7 candidate loss=0.0717 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 7 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-7 candidate executed my iter-6 midpoint prescription faithfully (shallow beta re-heated to median ~2.53, everything else held at iter-6 values, steep pocket untouched) and was REJECTED (loss 0.0717 vs the iter-3 base's 0.0671). My midpoint advice must be judged a failure, and the failure is diagnostic: the shallow-beta response surface between 2.34 and 2.59 is NOT locally linear. Exp 4 went 0.153 (beta 2.34, iter 6) -> 0.250 (beta 2.53, iter 7) -> 0.230 (beta 2.59 with iter-3 ancillaries) — the midpoint landed WORSE than both flanking values, and Exp 6 simultaneously crashed 0.582 -> 0.518 (its worst non-catastrophic value), against the prediction of ~0.59. Either the Exp-4/Exp-6 response to shallow beta is steeply non-monotone in this region or the Monte Carlo noise at these settings is large; either way, the conclusion is the same: STOP SCANNING SHALLOW BETA. The wins in iter 7 are real but insufficient: Exp 8 is exactly on target (0.6044 vs 0.6044), Exp 3 essentially exact (0.1206 vs 0.1227), Exp 1 fine (-0.178 vs -0.175), and Exp 5 posted its best value of the loop (0.6044, still -0.079 short). The losses: Exp 4 +0.088 (worst since iter 3), Exp 6 -0.112, Exp 7 -0.063, and the structural Exp 2 gap unchanged (0.188 vs 0.274, var 0.021 vs 0.093). The mechanistic picture across all seven iterations is now clear: beta moves Exp 4 and Exp 7 in OPPOSITE directions because both experiments probe small-margin behavior with opposite signs — that lever is exhausted and cannot beat the iter-3 base. The one shape lever never tested in isolation on the bimodal base is the shallow mode's DISPERSION. SCWI's weight map (w = v + tau*v^2) is equivalent to a power law with gamma ~1.2-1.5 over these designs' validity ranges; shallow-shoulder mass at gamma 1.25-1.42 is therefore SCWI-like, which simultaneously (a) lowers Exp 4 (anti-tally on the conflict probes — the same direction as beta cooling, but through the weight map), (b) raises Exp 7 (SCWI-following on the knife-edge cells — the OPPOSITE of beta cooling, which is exactly the trade beta could not solve), and (c) helps Exp 5's higher-threshold cells (flip thresholds 1.32-1.58), while added lower-tail mass below 0.81 feeds the (4-perfect vs 7x0.5) cells — Exp 5's largest gap. The center can stay near 1.0, which is what keeps Exp 8's kill composite calibrated.
Rationale: verdict=regenerate (the gate already rejected iter 7 at 0.0717 vs 0.0671). Build on the ACCEPTED iter-3 base and make ONE structural edit, with everything else frozen: (1) WIDEN THE SHALLOW GAMMA SD from 0.22 to ~0.30 and nudge the center from 0.99 to ~1.02, keeping the truncation [0.58, 1.42]. This is the only untried isolated lever: it adds sub-0.81 mass (Exp 5's flip cells, the suite's largest mean gap) AND upper-shoulder mass at 1.25-1.42 (SCWI-equivalent subjects who anti-follow the tally on Exp 4's conflict probes and follow SCWI on Exp 7's knife-edge cells — moving BOTH experiments in the needed directions at once, which no beta value could do). Expect Exp 4 ~0.17-0.20, Exp 7 recovering toward ~0.61-0.63, Exp 5 toward ~0.60-0.62, Exp 6 roughly held near 0.58, with Exp 8 diluting slightly (more mass above the 1.31-1.34 kill thresholds) to ~0.58-0.59 — an acceptable cost given Exp 8 is currently exactly on target and its gap would remain smaller than the Exp 4/5/7 gains it purchases. (2) FREEZE THE SHALLOW BETA at ~2.40 — between iter-6's 2.34 and iter-3's 2.59 but explicitly NOT the failed 2.53 midpoint — and do not re-scan it; the iter-7 result shows the Exp-4/Exp-6 response in this region is non-monotone or noise-dominated, and four consecutive rejections have now come from beta and steep-pocket scans. (3) HOLD everything else at the iter-6 values that were validated: shallow lapse [0.03, 0.12], guesser fraction 15%, steep pocket byte-identical to iter-3 (gamma ~N(2.10, 0.26) truncated [1.65, 2.75], beta median ~3.3). (4) Process discipline: this is a single-lever edit (the SD/center change plus the one-time beta freeze); do NOT bundle anything else, and given the apparent noise in the iter-7 Exp-4/Exp-6 readings, verify the direction of the Exp-4 movement before trusting fine-grained comparisons. (5) The structural Exp-2 problem (mean 0.188 vs 0.274, variance 0.021 vs 0.093) remains deferred: per my iter-5/iter-6 process notes, the hyper-steep pocket (gamma ~3.5-5, hot beta, 8-12% of engaged) should be tested in ISOLATION only after this SD widening re-establishes an accepted base, since its certain Exp-8 cost must be paid from a position of slack. The population mean elasticity (~1.27) stays below the arbiter's 1.4 ceiling, and all changes remain distribution-shape recalibrations inside the prescribed HEAI family (additive anti-validity power-law integration, bimodal continuous gamma, guesser subpopulation, heavy-tailed beta, symmetric lapse); no mechanism change is proposed.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 7 candidate loss=0.0717 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "rationale": "This is a single-lever distribution edit of the ACCEPTED iter-3 HEAI base (mechanism, code structure, seeds, and parameter boxes unchanged), implementing the iter-7 critic's diagnosis. Four consecutive rejections (iters 4-7) all came from scanning the shallow-beta and steep-pocket knobs, and iter-7's midpoint beta (2.53) landed WORSE than both flanking values (2.34 -> Exp4 0.153/Exp7 0.549; 2.59 -> Exp4 0.230/Exp7 0.593), proving that lever moves Exp 4 and Exp 7 in opposite directions because both experiments probe small-margin behavior with opposite signs — it is exhausted. The one shape lever never tested in isolation is the shallow mode's DISPERSION, and it is mechanistically the right one: widening the shallow SD from 0.22 to 0.30 (center 1.02, truncation [0.58, 1.42]) adds mass at BOTH ends of the shallow band. (a) Lower-tail mass below the 0.81 flip threshold (~25% of shallow subjects) feeds the (4-perfect vs 7x0.5) Exp-5 cells — the suite's largest mean gap (0.570 vs 0.684). (b) Upper-shoulder mass at 1.25-1.42 (~15% of shallow) is SCWI-equivalent (a power law with gamma in that band reproduces w = v + tau*v^2 over these designs' validity ranges): those subjects anti-follow the tally on Exp 4's conflict probes (pulling Exp 4 down from 0.230 toward ~0.17-0.20) while following SCWI's high-validity stack on Exp 7's knife-edge cells (pushing Exp 7 up toward ~0.61) — the exact opposite-sign pair of movements that no beta value could produce, which is why the beta scan failed. The cost is a slight Exp-8 dilution (more shallow mass above the 1.31-1.34 kill thresholds, moving the composite from iter-6's 0.630 overshoot toward ~0.58-0.59 against a target of 0.604) — an acceptable price given Exp 8 is currently the best-fitting experiment and the gap purchased on Exp 4/5/7 is much larger. The shallow beta is FROZEN at median ~2.40 (between the two flanking validated values, explicitly not the failed 2.53 midpoint), and the ancillaries validated in iter 6 are held: shallow lapse [0.03, 0.12], guesser fraction 15%, steep pocket byte-identical to iter-3 (gamma ~N(2.10, 0.26) trunc [1.65, 2.75], beta median ~3.3). Expected net movement vs the iter-3 base: Exp 4 0.230 -> ~0.18, Exp 5 0.570 -> ~0.60-0.62, Exp 7 0.593 -> ~0.61, Exp 6 roughly held ~0.58, Exp 8 0.591 -> ~0.58-0.59, with Exp 1/2/3 approximately held — a net loss reduction concentrated on the three largest fixable gaps. The structural Exp-2 problem (mean 0.19 vs 0.274, variance 0.03 vs 0.093) is deliberately deferred a second time per the iter-5/6/7 process notes: the hyper-steep pocket (gamma ~3.5-5) must be tested in isolation from a position of accepted slack, since bundling it here would repeat the iter-4/iter-5 bundling failures. The population mean elasticity (~1.15) remains below the arbiter's 1.4 ceiling, all population structure continues to be derived inside predict from uniform seeds, and the candidate stays squarely inside the prescribed HEAI family (additive anti-validity power-law integration, bimodal continuous gamma, guesser subpopulation, heavy-tailed beta, symmetric lapse); no mechanism change is proposed."
