# feedback_iter_06

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3_1`).

Replace THEORY 1 (SCWI) with a new theory, tentatively 'Compressive Anti-Validity Integration with a Moderate Deterministic Tail' (CAVI), designed as a stronger competitor to CNNAI rather than a return of SCWI. Mechanism sketch: (1) Keep the sign inversion — a rating of 1 is comprehended as a defect, per-cue defect magnitude d_j = v_j + tau*v_j^2 with tau in [0.35, 0.65] (a wider, higher range than SCWI's, needed for Experiment 1's +2.88 near-knife excess). (2) NEW: within-option diminishing sensitivity — the option's subjective defect load is D = (sum_j d_j * x_j)^kappa with kappa in [0.55, 0.85] (or equivalently a log-compressive map), so an option's value is -D. Small stacks (near-knife cells like AL, S-cells, M-cells) keep near-linear sharp margins, while large stacked endorsements grow sub-proportionally aversive — this flattens the high-ratio psychometrics that both current theories overshoot (Exp 10's 5x0.90-vs-11x0.50 kill cells down toward 0.60, Exp 12's rise down toward 0.30, Exp 4's disagreement-vs-agreement gap up toward 0.27 because compressed margins sit closer to the noise scale). (3) Population mixture: ~14% true guessers (beta ~ 0.02-0.10), ~70% engaged with lognormal beta (median ~2.0, log-sd 0.35, clipped [0.8, 6.0]), and ~16% deterministic tail (beta uniform [4.0, 6.5], lapse 0.02-0.04) — this reproduces Experiment 2's g ≈ 0.09 (a small but nonzero near-ceiling bloc, refuting both CNNAI's 0.00 and SCWI's 0.36) while keeping population means CNNAI-like on Exps 5-9. (4) Context elasticity retained but recalibrated: per-bucket eta redraw keyed on the rounded mean endorsed validity (as in CNNAI), with the stable-to-redraw variance ratio set for latent cross-context consistency r ≈ 0.20-0.25, matching Experiment 11's observed 0.196 between SCWI's 0.37 and CNNAI's 0.11. (5) Softmax(beta * (D_B - D_A)) plus symmetric lapse (0.03-0.09 engaged) and per-trial attention diffusion (sd ~0.05). This theory differs from SCWI by the compressive nonlinearity, the smaller deterministic bloc, and the context-keyed elasticity; it differs from CNNAI by the stronger supralinear per-cue contrast, the explicit deterministic tail, and the compression that CNNAI lacks. Parameter ranges should be tuned so that: Exp 1 AL excess lands in [+2.4, +3.2]; Exp 2 g in [0.06, 0.15]; Exp 10 kill-composite in [0.55, 0.65]; Exp 12 rise in [0.22, 0.36]; Exp 11 cross-ladder correlation in [0.15, 0.30].


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Kneed Compressive Anti-Validity Integration with a Moderate Deterministic Tail (CAVI-K), decoupled tau-trim + tail-linearity half-step. Subjects integrate all binary expert ratings into a per-option subjective DEFECT LOAD, comprehending a rating of 1 as a defect (sign inversion). Per-cue defect magnitude is supralinear in the instructed validity, d_j = v_j + tau*v_j^2, with the engaged tau ceiling trimmed to 0.55 so that no engaged subject sits at the Exp-8 kill-cell flip knife (tau ~ 0.64) and the per-subject weights stay inside the SCWI-like region the Exps 5/6/8 composites reward. The defect load is compressed by a two-regime map with the knee at 4.45 — above every AL stack (max 4.04 at the trimmed tau ceiling) and every 2-top-cue adherence cell, which keep full raw margins — while the large diagnostic stacks grow sub-proportionally aversive under kappa. Context elasticity (v_j/v_ref)^eta is keyed on the bucketed mean endorsed validity, with the stable/redraw sd ratio preserved at ~0.20 (0.08/0.15 after proportional scaling) so latent cross-context consistency is unchanged while total eta sd drops from 0.22 to 0.17, reducing sign-blur on the knife cells. Population: ~14% true guessers, ~70% engaged with homogenized lognormal beta (median 2.65, log-sd 0.29 — the configuration that landed Exp 9 at 0.190), and ~16% deterministic tail (beta 4.0-6.5) with kappa half-stepped to [0.82, 0.90]: near-linear enough that the tail's fitted Exp-12 bhat reaches the [3.0, 4.2] ramp (g in [0.06, 0.15]) but compressive enough to roughly halve the Exp-10 rise damage that full tail linearity caused. Choice is softmax(beta*(D_B - D_A)) with symmetric lapse and per-trial attention diffusion (sd 0.035).

    # Kneed Compressive Anti-Validity Integration (CAVI-K), iter 7.
    # DECOUPLED two-lever diff on the accepted iter-5 base, applying the
    # iter-6 critic's post-mortem of the rejected iter-6 bundle. The
    # iter-6 rejection decomposed cleanly: the tau trim HELPED (Exps
    # 5/6/8 all rose toward real), the tail-kappa raise was MIXED (fixed
    # Exp 12 but overshot Exp 10), and the engaged-beta median raise
    # 2.65 -> 3.1 was NET HARMFUL (broke Exp 1's guardrail, dropped
    # Exps 2/7/11, and collapsed Exp 9 to -0.007 via knee-bisection
    # saturation). Changes vs the accepted iter-5 base:
    #   (A) ENGAGED TAU CEILING 0.65 -> 0.55 (range now [0.35, 0.55]),
    #       with the eta sds scaled proportionally (stable 0.10 -> 0.08,
    #       redraw 0.20 -> 0.15) so the stable/redraw variance ratio —
    #       and hence the latent cross-context consistency r ~ 0.20 —
    #       is preserved while total eta sd drops 0.22 -> 0.17. The
    #       Exp-8 kill-cell flip knife sits at tau ~ 0.64; the old
    #       ceiling parked the top of the engaged mass exactly at the
    #       knife. The trim also lowers the max AL stack to
    #       3*(0.9 + 0.55*0.81) = 4.04, comfortably below the 4.45
    #       knee, so every AL cell is fully in the identity regime.
    #   (B) TAIL KAPPA HALF-STEP [0.78, 0.85] -> [0.82, 0.90]: midway
    #       between iter 5 and iter 6's [0.88, 1.0]. Iter 6 proved the
    #       diffusion-capped Exp-12 diagnosis (tail linearity + diffusion
    #       0.035 landed g = 0.147), but full linearity re-sharpened the
    #       tail's SCWI-like step on the above-knee twin-kill stacks and
    #       inflated Exp 10's rise to 0.448. The half-step should retain
    #       most of the Exp-12 gain (g ~ 0.08-0.12) while roughly
    #       halving the Exp-10 damage.
    #   Everything else is held VERBATIM from the accepted iter-5 base —
    #   in particular the engaged beta median 2.65 with log-sd 0.29 (the
    #   configuration that landed Exp 9 at 0.190; two data points show
    #   the Exp-9 response to engaged-beta sharpening is violently
    #   non-monotonic, so it is NOT touched), the engaged kappa range
    #   [0.55, 0.68] (the iter-6 trim to 0.65 is reverted), the knee at
    #   4.45, diffusion 0.035, the 14/70/16 mixture, the pinned tail
    #   eta, the bucketed context key, and all lapse ranges.

`rationale`:
This is a deliberately DECOUPLED two-lever diff of the accepted iter-5 base, following the iter-6 critic's post-mortem of the rejected three-lever bundle. Iter 6's rejection decomposed cleanly per experiment, which lets me keep its one validated win, half-step its mixed lever, and fully revert its harmful one. (1) KEEP THE TAU TRIM (lever A): engaged tau [0.35, 0.65] -> [0.35, 0.55], with eta sds scaled 0.10/0.20 -> 0.08/0.15 so the stable/redraw variance ratio (latent cross-context consistency r ~ 0.20) is preserved while total eta sd drops 0.22 -> 0.17. This was iter 6's clear win — Exp 8 rose 0.532 -> 0.586 (into [0.55, 0.65] for the first time), Exp 5 rose 0.516 -> 0.557, Exp 6 rose 0.568 -> 0.578 — because the old tau ceiling parked the top of the engaged mass exactly at the Exp-8 kill-cell flip knife (tau ~ 0.64), and because reduced eta spread stops sign-blur on Exp 5's SCWI-vs-PAHI opposition cells. The trim also lowers the max AL stack to 4.04, safely below the 4.45 knee, so every AL cell is fully in the identity regime — new knee headroom that further protects Exps 9/11 from the asymmetric-compression failure mode. (2) HALF-STEP THE TAIL KAPPA (lever B): [0.78, 0.85] -> [0.82, 0.90]. Iter 6 proved the tail-linearity mechanism works for Exp 12 (with diffusion at 0.035, full tail linearity landed g = 0.147, in the [0.06, 0.15] window for the first time since iter 3), but full linearity also re-sharpened the tail's SCWI-like step on the above-knee twin-kill stacks and inflated Exp 10's rise to 0.448. The half-step interpolates: most of the Exp-12 gain (target g ~ 0.08-0.12) at roughly half the Exp-10 cost (target rise ~ 0.36-0.40, versus iter 5's 0.364 with the soft tail — the marginal Exp-10 risk is the accepted price, and the pre-authorized conditional follow-up if it exceeds 0.36 is a small knee lower toward 4.2, which the new 4.04 max-AL-stack headroom now permits without touching any AL or adherence cell). (3) FULLY REVERT the engaged beta median to 2.65 (log-sd 0.29, clip [0.8, 6.0]) and the engaged kappa upper bound to 0.68: the beta raise to 3.1 broke Exp 1's -0.23 guardrail (-0.243), dropped Exps 2/7/11 against prediction, and collapsed Exp 9 from 0.190 to -0.007 via knee-bisection saturation — two data points now show the Exp-9 response to engaged-beta sharpening is violently non-monotonic, so the iter-5 beta configuration (which landed Exp 9 at 0.190, essentially the real 0.196) is treated as pinned. (4) HELD VERBATIM: knee 4.45, diffusion 0.035, the 14/70/16 mixture, the pinned tail eta, tail beta [4.0, 6.5], the bucketed-mean context key, and all lapse ranges. Only two mechanisms move, so attribution on the next verdict will be clean. Expected profile: Exp 1 ~ -0.20 to -0.22 (beta revert removes iter 6's over-steepening; tau trim softens slightly), Exp 2 ~ 0.19-0.21, Exp 3 ~ 0.14, Exp 4 ~ 0.12-0.14, Exps 5/6/7 ~ 0.55/0.58/0.60 (tau-trim gains retained at the iter-5 beta), Exp 8 ~ 0.57-0.60 (in window), Exp 9 ~ 0.15-0.22 (recovered via the beta revert; the trimmed tau ceiling also shrinks the 3x1.00-stack straddle of the knee from 4.05-4.95 to 4.05-4.65), Exp 10 ~ 0.36-0.40, Exp 11 ~ 1.9-2.1 (accepted this round per the critic's explicit instruction not to re-sharpen beta), Exp 12 ~ 0.08-0.12 (in window) — which should strictly beat the 0.1030 base.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1319 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1783 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1705 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.1231 -> ACCEPTED

    D > 0 means option A carries fewer/smaller anti-validity 'defects'
    and is therefore preferred by SCWI. SCWI predicts a POSITIVE slope
    (~0.2-0.3 with beta in [1.1,1.7], epsilon in [0.05,0.15]).
    Tallying cannot produce a positive slope: on count-tied trials
    (pairs 1-8, 24) it outputs exactly 0.5 for any beta/epsilon, and on
    all remaining trials its choice probability tracks the raw count
    margin, which is strongly ANTI-correlated with D across this design
    (the tally winner is almost always the weighted-margin loser). So

    # Kill trials pit a endorsements on higher-validity cues against b
    # endorsements on lower-validity cues (all other cues 0 for both
    # options, disjoint supports, each stack within one validity block)

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: CAVI is a faithful implementation of the arbiter's prescribed family (sign-inverted supralinear defect weights, within-option compression, three-part population mixture, context-keyed elasticity), and it clears the gate. The fit is genuinely excellent on the psychometric-shape metrics: Exp 1 (-0.180 vs -0.175), Exp 3 (0.140 vs 0.123), Exp 4 (0.186 vs 0.163), and — the round's headline win — Exp 10's rise (0.292 vs 0.296, where every prior theory overshot or undershot). The compression lever works exactly as intended on the high-ratio cells. However, the same compression is doing collateral damage everywhere margins are SMALL-to-MODERATE, and the candidate systematically undershoots the anti-validity adherence bloc: Exp 5 (0.456 vs 0.684), Exp 6 (0.474 vs 0.630), Exp 7 (0.529 vs 0.646), Exp 8 (0.522 vs 0.604, just below the arbiter's [0.55, 0.65] window), Exp 9 (0.067 vs 0.196, below the [0.15, 0.30] window), Exp 11 (1.12 vs 2.88 — far below the arbiter's [+2.4, +3.2] target, and even below the proposer's own 1.2-1.5 prediction), and Exp 12 (0.020 vs 0.091, below the [0.06, 0.15] window). The diagnosis is mechanical, not conceptual: a pure power map D = S^kappa compresses margins PROPORTIONALLY at every scale. For S > 1, the local margin slope is kappa*S^(kappa-1) < 1, so even 'small' stacks like Exp 11's AL cells (S ≈ 3.6-3.9, margin ≈ 0.28 uncompressed) get their margin roughly halved (≈ 0.14) — the theory's claim that 'small stacks keep near-linear sharp margins' is false for the power form whenever S > 1. The same halving softens the Exp 5-7 adherence cells and deflates the Exp 12 per-subject MLE beta fits (the metric fits a LINEAR-margin softmax, so the fitted bhat is the true beta scaled down by the compression slope, pushing the 16% deterministic tail below the [3.0, 4.2] ramp). Separately, the Exp 9 cross-ladder correlation (0.067) falls short of the by-construction r ≈ 0.20 because the eta-space consistency does not transfer linearly to choice-rate space: near-saturated per-ladder choice rates compress the correlation, so the stable/redraw variance split needs to be richer in the stable component than 0.20 to land at an observed 0.196.
Rationale: The candidate was accepted, so build on it — but it is not shippable yet: it misses the arbiter's explicit target windows on four experiments (8, 9, 11, 12) and undershoots real data by 0.12-0.23 on Exps 5-7. All failures point at ONE miscalibration, so the fix is a minor in-family adjustment, not a redesign: (1) Replace the pure power compression with an OFFSET/affine form that is near-identity at small S and compressive only at large S — e.g. D = (1 + S)^kappa - 1, or a two-regime map D = S for S < s0 and s0*(S/s0)^kappa for S >= s0 with s0 ≈ 2-3. This preserves the Exp 10 win (high-ratio cells have S ≈ 5-12 and stay compressed) while restoring near-linear margins on the AL cells (Exp 11 should rise from 1.12 toward the 2.4-2.9 range), the Exp 5-7 adherence composites (toward 0.60-0.68), and Exp 8's kill composite (into [0.55, 0.65]). (2) For Exp 12's g: the deterministic tail's effective slope is beta * kappa*S^(kappa-1); with the offset compression the tail's fitted bhat recovers, but also push the tail's kappa to [0.92, 1.0] (fully linear for the confidently inverted) and consider widening tail beta to [4.5, 7.5] so a larger share of tail subjects land bhat inside the [3.0, 4.2] ramp; target g ≈ 0.06-0.10. (3) For Exp 9: raise the stable share of eta — e.g. stable sd 0.15 with redraw sd 0.15 (eta-space r ≈ 0.5) — so that after choice-rate saturation the observed cross-ladder correlation lands near 0.20; verify the bucketed-mean key still separates the 0.50- and 0.60-ladders (it does: buckets ≈ 0.6 vs 0.7). (4) Keep everything else fixed: the supralinear tau range, the 14/70/16 mixture proportions, the lapse ranges, the attention diffusion, and the Exp 1-4 parameterization are all performing at or near the real values and should not be touched. Expected net effect: Exp 11 → ~2.4-2.9, Exps 5-7 → ~0.60-0.68, Exp 8 → ~0.57-0.62, Exp 9 → ~0.18-0.22, Exp 12 → ~0.06-0.09, with Exps 1-4 and 10 held (re-check Exp 10 after the compression change: the offset form slightly REDUCES compression at the twin-kill cells (S ≈ 4-5), which may nudge the rise up from 0.29 — if it drifts above 0.36, lower s0 or kappa slightly to compensate).

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1319 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1783 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iter 2 was REJECTED by the gate (loss 0.1783 vs the iter-1 base's 0.1319), and the per-experiment pattern cleanly identifies which of the three edits helped and which hurt. What HELPED: the offset (two-regime) compression. Exp 11 rose 1.12 → 1.56 (toward the real 2.88), Exp 5 rose 0.456 → 0.508 (toward 0.684), Exp 2 rose 0.202 → 0.221 (toward 0.274), and Exps 3/10 stayed acceptable. What HURT, badly: the eta enrichment (change C) plus the hot, near-linear tail now DRAWING eta (change B's side effect). Exp 9 exploded from 0.067 to 0.595 against a real value of 0.196 — a 3x overshoot of the target window. Exp 8 crashed from 0.522 to 0.438 (real 0.604) — BELOW chance, which is diagnostic: a large mass of hot subjects now flips to the LOW-validity stack on the 5x0.90-vs-7x0.70 knife cells. Mechanically, the elasticity multiplier (v_h/v_ref)^eta / (v_l/v_ref)^eta inflates the effective defect-weight ratio past the count ratio (1.40) on those cells at eta ≈ 0.25; with the enriched eta distribution (mean 0.12, sd ~0.21, now including the 16% hot tail) a substantial bloc sits past that flip, and with tail beta 4.5-7.5 they flip deterministically. The same near-linear hot tail saturates both Exp 9 ladders identically, which is what catapulted the cross-ladder correlation to 0.595. Collateral damage from the same source: Exp 6 dropped 0.474 → 0.435 (same knife-flip mechanism at high eta), Exp 4 dropped 0.186 → 0.118 (flipped subjects follow the anti-validity loser even more), and Exp 1's slope went over-negative (-0.180 → -0.219 vs real -0.175). Meanwhile the change that was specifically aimed at Exp 12 (tail kappa 0.92-1.0, beta 4.5-7.5) delivered nothing: g moved only 0.020 → 0.026 against a real 0.091. So change (B) bought nothing where it was aimed and cost where it wasn't; change (C) overshot ~3x past its target; change (A) is the one lever that moved things in the right direction and should be kept and pushed further.
Rationale: Build on the unchanged iter-1 accepted base with a partial-retention, partial-reversion diff. Do NOT repeat the full eta enrichment — the gate rejected it, and the observed-correlation response is strongly saturating (a ~2x stable-share change moved Exp 9 from 0.067 to 0.595), so take a fractional step. Concretely: (1) REVERT the eta split most of the way back to iter 1: stable eta_base sd ~0.11-0.12 with per-context redraw sd ~0.18-0.19 (between iter 1's 0.10/0.20 and iter 2's 0.15/0.15), and PIN the deterministic tail's eta_base to a fixed small value (~0.05, no ndtri draw). The tail's stable hot beta and tau are already cross-ladder traits and provide a modest, controlled consistency boost on Exp 9 (from 0.067 toward ~0.15-0.20) without flipping the Exp 6/8 knife cells — the iter-2 Exp 8 sub-0.5 crash and the Exp 6/4/1 regressions should all revert with this single change. (2) KEEP the offset compression but RAISE s0 from 3.0 to ~3.8-4.2. The remaining Exp 11 shortfall (1.56 vs 2.88) lives in the fact that the AL cells' stacks (S ≈ 3.6-3.9) still sit ABOVE s0 = 3.0 and get compressed for the engaged bulk (local slope ~0.65-0.7, margin ~0.30 → ~0.21). With s0 ≈ 4.0 the AL cells are fully in the identity regime for everyone: back-of-envelope, engaged sigmoid(2.0*0.30) ≈ 0.65, tail sigmoid(5*0.30) ≈ 0.82, guessers 0.5 → population anti-rate ≈ 0.68, which lands the mean excess near the real 2.88 (vs 1.56 now). Raising s0 also puts Exp 6's 4-5-cue low stacks (S ≈ 3.4-4.3) in or near the identity regime, raising top-cue adherence toward 0.63. The Exp 10 diagnostic stacks (S ≈ 6-9) remain compressed; if the rise drifts above ~0.33, trim the engaged kappa upper bound from 0.85 to ~0.80 to compensate — do not touch the rest of the kappa range. (3) Exp 12: the tail re-targeting failed (g stuck at 0.026), which points to a different cap — the per-trial attention diffusion (sd 0.05) injects margin noise (sd roughly 0.2-0.3 on the metric's fitted margins of 0.5-1.3) that deflates every subject's fitted bhat below the [3.0, 4.2] ramp regardless of true beta. Reduce the attention diffusion sd to ~0.03-0.04 (still within the arbiter's '~0.05' prescription) so the tail's fitted bhat can actually reach the ramp; this also nudges the undershooting Exps 5-8 up slightly, which is the right direction. (4) Leave everything else untouched: tau range [0.35, 0.65], the 14/70/16 mixture, lapse ranges, the bucketed-mean context key, and the softmax are all performing and were explicitly flagged to keep. Expected net profile: Exps 1-4 revert to their iter-1 near-real values (Exp 1 ~ -0.18, Exp 4 ~ 0.17-0.19), Exp 11 → ~2.4-2.9, Exps 5-7 → 0.55-0.65, Exp 8 → 0.55-0.62, Exp 9 → 0.12-0.22, Exp 10 held near 0.30, Exp 12 → 0.06-0.10 — which should strictly beat the 0.1319 base.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1783 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1705 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iter 3 was REJECTED (loss 0.1705 vs the iter-1 base's 0.1319), so this verdict is regenerate. The iter-3 diff was a four-lever change whose components can now be evaluated against three iterations of evidence. What WORKED: (a) the attention-diffusion cut (0.05 -> 0.035) finally fixed Experiment 12 (g = 0.120, inside the arbiter's [0.06, 0.15] window for the first time, vs 0.020/0.026 before) — the proposer's diagnosis that per-trial margin noise was capping the fitted bhat was correct; (b) pinning the deterministic tail's eta and the partial eta reversion brought Exp 9 from the iter-2 explosion (0.595) back to 0.311, just above the [0.15, 0.30] window. What FAILED: the s0 = 4.0 knee raise did NOT deliver any of its predicted gains — Exp 11 went DOWN (1.56 -> 1.20 vs real 2.88), Exp 5 went DOWN (0.508 -> 0.450 vs real 0.684), Exp 7 went DOWN (0.515 -> 0.479), Exp 8 stayed broken (0.452 vs real 0.604, below the [0.55, 0.65] window), and Exp 10's rise overshot further (0.39 vs real 0.296, above the [0.22, 0.36] window). The proposer's back-of-envelope predictions were wrong in direction on five of twelve experiments. I can now identify the mechanical reason the s0 raise backfired: the knee at s0 = 4.0 sits INSIDE the AL-cell stack range. The AL high stack is S_h = 3*(0.9 + tau*0.81), which spans 3.55-4.43 over the engaged tau range [0.35, 0.65], while the low stack S_l = 3*(0.85 + tau*0.7225) spans 3.34-3.99. For every subject with tau > ~0.53 — which is 100% of the deterministic tail (tau 0.55-0.65) and ~40% of the engaged bulk — the HIGH-validity stack crosses the knee and gets compressed while the low stack stays in the identity regime. This asymmetric compression shrinks the AL margin exactly for the hottest, most anti-valid subjects, which is why Exp 11 fell instead of rising. The simultaneous kappa trim (upper bound 0.85 -> 0.80, i.e. stronger compression everywhere above the knee) then counteracted the s0 raise on the Exps 5/7/8 adherence cells, so the net there was negative too. Two levers pushed in opposite directions at once — the classic confound. The deeper structural finding across all three iterations: Exps 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 are ALL undershooting in the same direction (too-soft anti-validity adherence), all three iterations fiddled exclusively with compression geometry and eta while the engaged beta median stayed at 2.0, and the arithmetic shows the adherence deficit is primarily a SHARPNESS deficit. On the AL cells the raw margin is structurally ~0.28-0.32 (bounded by tau <= 0.65 and the 0.90-vs-0.85 validity gap); at beta = 2.0 the engaged anti-rate is only ~0.64, giving population excess ~1.6-1.8 even with perfect identity compression. Hitting the real 2.88 requires a population anti-rate of 0.74, i.e. an engaged+tail average of ~0.78, which needs an effective beta of ~4 on those margins. The engaged beta median is the one big in-family lever never touched, and the arbiter explicitly authorized tuning parameter ranges to land the AL excess in [2.4, 3.2].
Rationale: Build on the unchanged iter-1 base with a diff that (i) keeps the two proven iter-3 wins, (ii) fixes the knee-placement bug, and (iii) pulls the one untried lever. Concretely: (1) RAISE THE ENGAGED BETA MEDIAN from 2.0 to ~3.0-3.5 (keep log-sd 0.35, clip [0.8, 6.0]). This directly attacks the shared undershoot on Exps 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 simultaneously; the AL arithmetic above shows it is the only route toward the arbiter's [2.4, 3.2] AL-excess window. Guardrails: if Exp 1's slope falls below ~-0.22 (real -0.175) or Exp 10's rise exceeds ~0.36, compensate by LOWERING s0 (more compression on the large Exp-10 stacks), not by walking beta back below ~2.8. Note honestly: even at beta ~3.5 the AL excess likely lands ~2.0-2.3, still short of 2.4 because the 14% guesser bloc alone costs ~0.85 excess; if the loss weighting justifies it, a further step toward beta ~4 is the only in-family way to close the rest, priced against Exp 1 steepening. (2) FIX THE KNEE PLACEMENT: either s0 <= ~3.3 (both AL stacks compressed together — margins shrink proportionally but the sign is stable, and this is what iter 2's s0 = 3.0 did when it raised Exp 11 to 1.56) or s0 >= ~4.6 (both AL stacks in identity for every tau). s0 = 4.0 is precisely the worst choice — the knee bisects the AL stacks for the hot-tau population. Given the beta raise will already steepen Exp 10's rise, recommend s0 ~ 3.2-3.5. (3) KEEP the diffusion at 0.035 (Exp 12 is in window; if the beta raise pushes g above 0.15, revert diffusion toward 0.04 rather than touching the tail). (4) KEEP the tail's eta pinned at a fixed small value and REVERT the engaged eta split fully to the iter-1 base (stable sd 0.10 / redraw sd 0.20) — the iter-3 partial step (0.115/0.185) left Exp 9 above its window (0.311) without buying any adherence. (5) DO NOT trim the engaged kappa bounds — restore the base range; the iter-3 trim strengthened compression and canceled the s0 raise on the adherence cells. (6) Process note for the proposer: three iterations of back-of-envelope predictions have been directionally wrong on the experiments they targeted (iter 3 predicted Exp 11 ~2.4-2.9, got 1.20; predicted Exps 5-8 up, got flat-to-down). Before committing, compute the actual stack sums S = sum_j (v_j + tau*v_j^2) * (v_j/v_ref)^eta for the diagnostic cells at the extremes of tau, and check which side of the knee each option's stack falls on — the tau-dependence of the stack magnitudes is what the envelope arithmetic has been missing. Expected profile if this lands: Exp 1 ~ -0.19 to -0.22, Exp 2 ~ 0.22-0.26, Exps 5-8 ~ 0.55-0.65, Exp 9 ~ 0.10-0.20, Exp 10 ~ 0.28-0.36 (via s0), Exp 11 ~ 1.9-2.3, Exp 12 held ~0.10-0.15 — which should strictly beat the 0.1319 base.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1705 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.1231 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iter 4 was ACCEPTED (loss 0.1231 < 0.1319), and my iter-3 advice was followed and helped: the knee was re-placed above the AL stacks by computed arithmetic, the engaged beta median was raised (moderated from my 3.0-3.5 to 2.5), the eta split was reverted, and the two iter-3 wins (diffusion 0.035, pinned tail eta) were kept. The result is the best profile yet: Exp 11 jumped 1.20 -> 2.24 (toward real 2.88), Exps 6/7 rose to 0.510/0.567 (toward 0.630/0.646), Exp 10 landed at 0.350 (inside [0.22, 0.36]), and Exp 12 held at 0.075 (inside [0.06, 0.15]). However, the candidate is not shippable against the arbiter's explicit windows: Exp 9 now OVERSHOOTS (0.388 vs real 0.196, above the [0.15, 0.30] window), Exp 8 remains below its window (0.519 vs [0.55, 0.65]), Exp 11 sits just below its window (2.24 vs [2.4, 3.2]), and the shared adherence undershoot persists on Exps 2 (0.158 vs 0.274 — this one actually REGRESSED from iter 1's 0.202), 5 (0.509 vs 0.684), and 6 (0.510 vs 0.630). The single most informative datum is the Exp 9 trajectory: iter 1 (beta median 2.0, split 0.10/0.20) gave 0.067; iter 4 (beta median 2.5, SAME split) gave 0.388. With the eta split held constant, the entire 0.32 swing is beta-saturation: hotter engaged betas push subjects to near-deterministic choices on BOTH ladders, and a saturated bloc correlates perfectly across ladders. This means the eta split is the WRONG knob at beta 2.5 — the cross-ladder correlation is now driven by the hot end of the engaged beta distribution, not by latent context consistency.
Rationale: Regenerate with a single-lever diff on the accepted iter-4 base. (1) PRIMARY LEVER — TRIM THE ENGAGED BETA LOG-SD from 0.35 to ~0.28-0.30, keeping the median at 2.5 and the clip [0.8, 6.0]. This one change attacks three failures at once: (a) it removes the saturating hot-engaged bloc that catapulted Exp 9 from 0.067 to 0.388 at a constant eta split, pulling the cross-ladder correlation back toward the 0.15-0.30 window WITHOUT touching the eta geometry that iter 2 showed is dangerously saturating; (b) it removes the soft low-beta tail of the engaged distribution, which raises mean anti-validity adherence on Exps 5/6/8/11 simultaneously — the same shared undershoot that has persisted all four iterations; (c) it should partially recover Exp 2 (iter 1's broader-beta profile scored 0.202; the sharpening that came with the median raise appears to have crushed the disagreement-vs-agreement gap to 0.158). (2) ONLY IF Exp 11 remains below 2.4 after the log-sd trim, nudge the engaged median 2.5 -> ~2.65 — a small step; the proposer's own arithmetic shows the AL sigmoid is already saturating (beta 2.5 -> 0.66, beta 3.2 -> 0.71), so do NOT jump to 3.0+. (3) HOLD FIXED: knee 4.45, engaged kappa [0.55, 0.70], tau [0.35, 0.65], the 0.10/0.20 eta split, attention diffusion 0.035, the pinned tail eta, the 14/70/16 mixture, and all lapse ranges — every one of these is either in-window or was explicitly validated this iteration. (4) GUARDRAILS: Exp 1's slope must not fall below ~-0.23 (it is already somewhat over-steep at -0.209 vs real -0.175) and Exp 10's rise must not exceed 0.36; if the rise drifts up, trim ONLY the engaged kappa upper bound from 0.70 to ~0.66-0.68 (a single small step — not the iter-3 confounded trim that fought the knee raise). (5) DIAGNOSTIC FLAG for the next iteration: the knee at 4.45 was calibrated to the Exp 11 AL stacks (max 4.28), but Exp 9's 3x1.00 top stacks span 4.05-4.95 across the engaged tau range — the knee BISECTS those, so low-tau subjects get identity-vs-compressed (sharp) ladder margins while high-tau subjects get both-compressed (soft) margins. If Exp 9 is still above its window after the log-sd trim, this subject-heterogeneous asymmetric compression is the next suspect to examine (compute which side of 4.45 each Exp 9 stack falls on per tau, per the process note from my iter-3 critique). Expected profile: Exp 9 -> ~0.15-0.28, Exp 11 -> ~2.3-2.6, Exps 5/6 -> ~0.55-0.60, Exp 8 -> ~0.53-0.56, Exp 2 -> ~0.18-0.22, with Exps 1/3/4/10/12 held — which should strictly beat the 0.1231 base.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.1231 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.1030 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iter 5 was ACCEPTED (loss 0.1030, best yet) and my iter-4 advice (log-sd trim 0.35→0.29 with a small median nudge, kappa guardrail) worked: Exp 9 landed almost exactly on the real value (0.1895 vs 0.1963, inside [0.15, 0.30] for the first time), Exp 2 partially recovered (0.158→0.201 vs real 0.274), and Exps 6/7 improved to 0.568/0.597 (toward 0.630/0.646). The beta-homogenization diagnosis — that Exp 9's correlation was driven by the saturating hot end of the engaged beta distribution — is now confirmed by intervention. However, the same trim had a predictable cost that materialized: Exp 11 FELL (2.24→1.96 vs real 2.88, further from the [2.4, 3.2] window) because removing the hot bloc removed the near-saturated subjects who were carrying AL-cell adherence; the small median nudge (2.65) did not compensate. Exp 12's drop (0.075→0.039) occurred with ZERO tail-relevant parameter changes and should be read as simulation noise (the tail parameters, diffusion, and knee are all identical to iter 4), not as a regression to chase with new mechanisms. The remaining genuine misses are: Exp 5 (0.516 vs 0.684 — the largest absolute miss; pure SCWI, pi_3_1, scores 0.651 there, so the candidate's deviations from the SCWI weighting are what cost ~0.13), Exp 8 (0.532 vs 0.604, below [0.55, 0.65]), Exp 11 (1.96 vs [2.4, 3.2]), Exp 1 over-steep (-0.218 vs -0.175), and Exp 10 marginally above its window (0.364 vs ceiling 0.36). The shared mechanism behind Exps 5/8/1 is per-subject weighting noise and tau excess on knife cells: the engaged tau ceiling of 0.65 sits exactly at the flip threshold tau ≈ 0.64 for Exp 8's 5x0.90-vs-7x0.70 kill cell (w(0.9)/w(0.7) crosses the 1.40 count ratio there), and the eta total sd of ~0.22 blurs the sign on Exp 5's SCWI-vs-PAHI opposition cells, which the metric classifies against the SCWI box tau ∈ [0.25, 0.45]. The candidate is close but not shippable against the arbiter's explicit windows: four experiments (5, 8, 11, 12) sit outside them.
Rationale: Regenerate with a three-lever diff on the accepted iter-5 base; every lever is now backed by an isolated diagnosis, and the levers that must NOT move are explicitly pinned. (1) PRIMARY — DETERMINISTIC-TAIL KAPPA [0.78, 0.85] → [0.88, 1.0]. This is a deliberate retry of the iter-2 lever that appeared to fail (g stuck at 0.026), but we now know it was confounded: diffusion 0.05 was capping every subject's fitted bhat below the [3.0, 4.2] ramp, and the iter-3 diffusion cut to 0.035 fixed that cap. With near-linear tail kappa, tail bhat ≈ beta × compression-slope rises from ~2.4-3.9 to ~3.2-5.2, putting roughly half the 16% tail inside the ramp → g ≈ 0.08-0.11, inside [0.06, 0.15]. Exp 10 risk is low: the tail is already near-saturated on the Exp-10 cells (compressed margins ~0.7-1.2 × beta 4-6.5), so extra tail linearity barely moves p_twin/p_high. Do NOT re-widen tail beta — iter 2 showed that buys nothing. (2) TAU CEILING + ETA VARIANCE — engaged tau [0.35, 0.65] → [0.35, 0.55], and scale the eta sds down proportionally (stable 0.10 → 0.08, redraw 0.20 → 0.15), preserving the variance ratio ≈ 0.20 so the arbiter's latent cross-context consistency prescription is intact while total eta sd drops from 0.22 to 0.18. Rationale: the Exp-8 flip threshold sits at tau ≈ 0.64, so the current ceiling parks the top of the engaged mass exactly at the knife; trimming it moves kill-cell choices toward the high-validity stack (Exp 8 → ~0.55-0.58). The same trim pushes per-subject weights toward the SCWI box that Exp 5's metric classifies against (pure SCWI scores 0.65 vs our 0.52) and softens Exp 1's over-steep slope toward pi_3's -0.19. (3) ENGAGED BETA MEDIAN 2.65 → ~3.1, log-sd HELD at 0.29, clip unchanged. The tau trim costs ~5% of the AL margin (0.28→0.265); the median raise more than restores the sigmoid argument and recovers the AL adherence the iter-5 homogenization gave up. Target engaged AL anti-rate ~0.70, population excess ~2.3-2.6 — entering the [2.4, 3.2] window for the first time. This also pushes Exp 2's gap toward 0.24-0.27. The thin log-sd is what protects Exp 9 from re-saturating, so it must not be re-widened. (4) GUARDRAILS, in order of invocation: Exp 1 must not fall below -0.23 — if it does, trade the tau ceiling down further (0.55 → 0.50), NOT beta back down; Exp 9 must stay in [0.15, 0.30] — if it drifts high, trim log-sd 0.29 → 0.26 before touching the median; Exp 10 must stay ≤ 0.36 — if the changes push it over, trim the engaged kappa upper bound 0.68 → 0.65 as a single small step; Exp 12 must stay ≤ 0.15 — if it overshoots, revert diffusion toward 0.04. (5) LAST-RESORT-ONLY knob, NOT part of the main diff: engaged epsilon [0.03, 0.09] → [0.02, 0.07] recovers ~0.02-0.03 of AL anti-rate if Exp 11 still lands below 2.3 with everything else in place — but it steepens Exp 1 and raises Exp 9/10, so deploy it only if the guardrails have headroom. (6) HOLD FIXED: knee 4.45, diffusion 0.035, the 14/70/16 mixture, the pinned tail eta, the bucketed context key, and all other ranges. Process notes: (a) before committing, compute the actual stack sums and margins for the Exp 5/8/11 diagnostic cells at the extremes of the NEW tau range and check which side of the knee each option falls on — the standing iter-3 lesson; (b) treat Exp 12's iter-4→5 movement as noise (no tail-relevant parameter changed) — verify with the variance report rather than adding mechanism; (c) do not re-widen the beta log-sd or re-enrich the eta split — both were gate-rejected in iters 2-3 and the current eta geometry plus thin beta spread is what finally landed Exp 9. Expected profile: Exp 1 → -0.19 to -0.21, Exp 2 → 0.22-0.26, Exps 5/6/7 → 0.56-0.62/0.58-0.62/0.60-0.64, Exp 8 → 0.55-0.58, Exp 9 held 0.15-0.25, Exp 10 → 0.30-0.36, Exp 11 → 2.3-2.6, Exp 12 → 0.07-0.11 — which should strictly beat the 0.1030 base.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.1030 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.1465 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 6 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iter 6 was REJECTED by the gate (loss 0.1465 vs the iter-5 base's 0.1030), and the per-experiment decomposition shows my iter-5 three-lever prescription was partially wrong: the levers interacted destructively and several of my directional predictions failed. Grading each lever against the data: (B) the tau-ceiling trim (0.65->0.55, with proportional eta scaling) was the clear WIN — Exp 8 rose 0.532->0.586 (inside [0.55, 0.65] for the first time), Exp 5 rose 0.516->0.557, Exp 6 rose 0.568->0.578, all toward the real values, exactly as the flip-knife arithmetic predicted. (A) the tail-kappa raise ([0.78,0.85]->[0.88,1.0]) was MIXED — it finally fixed Exp 12 (g 0.039->0.147, inside [0.06, 0.15]), but my claim that 'Exp 10 risk is low: the tail is already near-saturated on its cells' was WRONG: Exp 10's rise jumped 0.364->0.448 against a real 0.296 and a 0.36 ceiling. Restoring tail linearity on the above-knee twin-kill stacks re-sharpened the tail's SCWI-like step, inflating the rise. (C) the engaged beta median raise (2.65->3.1) was NET HARMFUL: Exp 1 broke its -0.23 guardrail (-0.218->-0.243 vs real -0.175), Exp 2 FELL (0.201->0.169 vs real 0.274; I predicted 0.22-0.26), Exp 7 fell (0.597->0.545), and Exp 11 FELL (1.96->1.88) despite my prediction of 2.3-2.6 — the +17% sigmoid-argument raise did not overcome the tau-trim margin loss. Worst of all, Exp 9 collapsed from a near-perfect 0.190 to -0.007. The Exp 9 collapse is mechanically explicable: with the trimmed tau ceiling the 3x1.00 top stacks span 4.05-4.65, still straddling the 4.45 knee, and the 0.60-ladder low stacks (4.3-7.2) sit in the knee's maximally nonlinear, subject-heterogeneous compression zone; the beta raise then saturates subjects on whichever side of these knife-bisected margins they land, so per-subject 0.50-ladder and 0.60-ladder rates decorrelate. This is the exact knee-bisection failure mode I flagged as a 'diagnostic suspect' in iter 4, now realized. The engaged kappa trim (D) neither held Exp 10 in window nor helped Exp 9.
Rationale: Regenerate on the unchanged iter-5 base with a DECOUPLED diff — iter 6 is the second time a bundled multi-lever change has been rejected because the levers interact, so change at most two things and make attribution possible. (1) KEEP the tau trim verbatim (engaged tau [0.35, 0.55], eta sds 0.08/0.15, variance ratio preserved): it is the best-validated lever in the whole loop (Exps 5/6/8 all moved toward real; Exp 8 now in window) and it also lowers the max AL stack to 4.04, which creates new knee headroom (see 4). (2) REVERT the engaged beta median to 2.65 (log-sd 0.29, clip unchanged): it broke the Exp 1 guardrail, dropped Exps 2/7/11 against prediction, and is a prime contributor to the Exp 9 saturation collapse. Do NOT raise it again this loop — two data points (iter 4's 0.388 at median 2.5/wide sd, iter 6's collapse at 3.1) show the Exp 9 response to engaged-beta sharpening is violently non-monotonic and dominates the loss. (3) HALF-STEP the tail kappa to [0.82, 0.90] — midway between iter 5's [0.78, 0.85] and iter 6's [0.88, 1.0]. This should retain most of the Exp 12 gain (target g ~0.08-0.12, inside [0.06, 0.15]) while roughly halving the Exp 10 damage (target rise ~0.36-0.40). Also REVERT the engaged kappa upper bound to 0.68: the 0.65 trim failed to hold Exp 10 and deepens the knee-zone nonlinearity that decorrelated Exp 9. (4) If Exp 10 still exceeds 0.36 after the half-step, the correct compensating knob is now the KNEE, not kappa: with tau <= 0.55 the max AL stack is only 4.04, so the knee can be lowered from 4.45 toward ~4.2, compressing the Exp 10 diagnostic stacks harder while leaving every AL and 2-top-cue cell in identity — but apply this as a SINGLE follow-up step only if needed, and first compute (do not envelope-estimate) which side of the candidate knee every Exp 9 ladder stack falls on at tau = 0.35 and 0.55, per the standing iter-3/4 process note; the 3x1.00 stacks (4.05-4.65) straddle any knee in [4.0, 4.7], and that straddle is the confirmed Exp 9 failure mode. (5) Exp 11 will fall back toward ~1.9-2.0 with the beta revert — accept that this round rather than re-sharpening beta; if everything else lands in window and the loss budget allows one more lever, the pre-authorized engaged epsilon trim ([0.03, 0.09] -> [0.02, 0.07]) is the remaining in-family route to ~2.2-2.4, but only deploy it if Exp 1 is above -0.22 and Exp 9/10 are inside their windows, since it steepens all three. (6) HOLD FIXED: diffusion 0.035, the 14/70/16 mixture, pinned tail eta, tail beta [4.0, 6.5], the bucketed context key, knee 4.45 (absent the conditional step in 4), and all other ranges. Process discipline: my iter-5 directional predictions for Exps 2, 10, and 11 were all wrong, and iter 6's rejection is partly on that advice — so before committing, simulate the candidate's per-experiment profile at the extremes of the changed ranges and report the predicted values; do not bundle more than two levers. Expected profile: Exp 1 ~ -0.20 to -0.22, Exp 2 ~ 0.19-0.21, Exps 5/6/7 ~ 0.55/0.58/0.60, Exp 8 ~ 0.57-0.60, Exp 9 ~ 0.15-0.22 (recovered via the beta revert), Exp 10 ~ 0.34-0.40, Exp 11 ~ 1.9-2.1, Exp 12 ~ 0.08-0.12 — which should strictly beat the 0.1030 base.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.1465 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1276 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

  "interpretation": "Iter 7 was REJECTED by the gate (loss 0.1276 vs the iter-5 base's 0.1030), so this verdict is regenerate. The proposer executed my iter-6 decoupled diff faithfully (tau trim kept, beta median reverted to 2.65, tail kappa half-stepped to [0.82, 0.90], engaged kappa reverted to 0.68), and the per-experiment decomposition now yields a clean and important attribution lesson. What worked as predicted: the beta revert recovered Exp 9 partway (-0.007 -> 0.132, though still below the [0.15, 0.30] window) and Exp 2 hit its best value yet (0.231 vs real 0.274); the tau trim's gains partially persisted (Exp 5: 0.516 -> 0.598 toward 0.684; Exp 8: 0.532 -> 0.567 toward 0.604). What failed: the tail-kappa half-step did NOT interpolate. Exp 10's rise came in at 0.451 \u2014 slightly WORSE than iter 6's full-linearity 0.448 \u2014 and Exp 12's g came in at 0.188, ABOVE iter 6's 0.147, despite tail kappa moving substantially toward linearity in both cases. Since tail kappa went DOWN from iter 6 to iter 7 while both metrics went UP, the tail-kappa lever is essentially spent on these two experiments: the marginal response in the [0.82, 1.0] region is flat-to-noise (Exp 12's var is 0.13). The real driver of the Exp 10 overshoot is the TAU TRIM itself, and the arithmetic is now identifiable: on the 4x1.00-vs-8x0.50 twin-kill cell the raw anti-validity margin is exactly 2*tau (S_H = 4+4tau vs S_L = 4+2tau), so cutting the engaged tau ceiling from 0.65 to 0.55 shrank the twin-kill margin ~15-20% across the whole engaged mass, dropping p_twin and inflating the rise from 0.364 to ~0.45. My iter-6 attribution of the Exp 10 jump to 'tail linearity' was wrong; the iter-6-vs-7 comparison corrects it. The same trim-plus-eta-sharpening (total eta sd 0.22 -> 0.17) also raised Exp 12's fitted bhats past the [3.0, 4.2] ramp. Collateral: Exp 7 regressed (0.597 -> 0.541), Exp 1 sits exactly on its -0.23 guardrail (-0.230), and Exp 11 remains stuck at 1.92 \u2014 but note the sigmoid/guesser arithmetic now shows Exp 11's [2.4, 3.2] window is essentially unreachable in this family: with 14% guessers and margin ~0.29, hitting excess 2.88 requires engaged anti-rate ~0.78, i.e. effective beta ~4.4 on the AL cells, which iters 4 and 6 both showed destroys Exps 1/9/10. Iter 6's beta 3.1 moved Exp 11 from 1.96 to 1.88 \u2014 the AL sigmoid is saturated; beta is not the route.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Regenerate on the unchanged iter-5 base with a TWO-lever diff whose attribution is clean, plus explicit fallbacks. (1) PRIMARY \u2014 LOWER THE KNEE from 4.45 to ~4.20-4.25. This is the pre-authorized conditional follow-up, now triggered (Exp 10 = 0.451 >> 0.36 ceiling). With tau <= 0.55 the max AL stack is 4.04, so every AL cell and every 2-top-cue adherence cell stays in the identity regime \u2014 Exp 11 (already at its family ceiling) and Exp 6 cannot regress through the knee. Mechanism: on the 3x1.00-vs-5x0.60 twin cell the high stack (4.05-4.65) crosses a 4.2 knee for most engaged subjects while the low stack (3.99) stays in identity, shrinking D_H and raising p_twin; on the 4x1.00 cells both stacks sit further above a lower knee and their margins compress, pulling both p_twin up and p_high toward 0.5. Both effects push the rise down toward ~0.33-0.38. The knee also lowers fitted bhats on the large stacks, pulling Exp 12 down toward its window. (2) TAIL KAPPA QUARTER-STEP DOWN: [0.82, 0.90] -> [0.80, 0.87]. Two runs at kappa >= 0.82 overshot Exp 12 (0.147, 0.188) and two at [0.78, 0.85] undershot (0.075, 0.039); interpolate between the flanks rather than repeating either endpoint. If the knee lever alone already lands g in [0.06, 0.15], hold tail kappa at [0.82, 0.90] instead \u2014 do not stack both downward blindly; check the variance report first since Exp 12's var (0.13) is large. (3) DO NOT touch: engaged tau [0.35, 0.55] (its Exps 5/8/2 gains are real and the Exp 10 damage is now handled by the knee, not by walking tau back), engaged beta median 2.65 / log-sd 0.29, the eta sds 0.08/0.15, diffusion 0.035, the 14/70/16 mixture, tail beta, and lapse ranges. (4) DO NOT chase Exp 11 upward with beta or epsilon this round \u2014 the sigmoid/guesser arithmetic caps it near 2.0-2.2 in this family, the epsilon trim's guardrails (Exp 1 at -0.230, Exp 9 at 0.132, Exp 10 at 0.451) are all violated right now, and two beta-raise attempts have been gate-rejected. Accept ~1.9-2.0 and spend the lever budget on Exps 10/12, which carry 0.25 of combined correctable error. (5) GUARDRAILS AND FALLBACKS, in order: (a) if Exp 9 falls below ~0.10 after the knee change, the knee-bisection of the 3x1.00 stacks (4.05-4.65 straddles ANY knee in that range) is decorrelating the ladders \u2014 revert the knee to 4.35 and instead recover Exp 10 via a partial tau-ceiling restore (0.55 -> 0.60, still clear of the Exp-8 flip knife at 0.64); (b) if Exp 12 undershoots below 0.06, restore tail kappa to [0.82, 0.90]; (c) if Exp 1 falls below -0.235, the fallback is likewise the tau-ceiling route, not beta. (6) PROCESS DISCIPLINE, standing: before committing, COMPUTE (not envelope-estimate) the actual stack sums S = sum_j (v_j + tau*v_j^2)*(v_j/v_ref)^eta for every Exp 9, 10, and 11 diagnostic cell at tau = 0.35 and 0.55, and verify which side of the candidate knee each option's stack falls on \u2014 my iter-6 prediction that the half-step would land Exp 10 at 0.36-0.40 was wrong because I misattributed the rise to tail linearity; the iter-6-vs-7 comparison is the correction, and the same discipline applies to the knee move now. Also report predicted per-experiment values at the range extremes before submitting. Expected profile: Exp 1 ~ -0.22, Exp 2 ~ 0.22, Exps 5/6 ~ 0.58/0.56, Exp 7 ~ 0.54-0.58 (monitor \u2014 if it stays depressed, the suspect is the eta-sd reduction, and a small redraw-sd restore 0.15 -> 0.17 is the follow-up, NOT this round), Exp 8 ~ 0.56, Exp 9 ~ 0.12-0.20, Exp 10 ~ 0.33-0.38, Exp 11 ~ 1.9-2.0, Exp 12 ~ 0.08-0.13 \u2014 which should strictly beat the 0.1030 base by recovering ~0.15 of Exp 10 and ~0.07 of Exp 12 error at minimal cost elsewhere."
