# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3_1`).

Replace THEORY 1 (SCWI) with a new theory, tentatively 'Compressive Anti-Validity Integration with a Moderate Deterministic Tail' (CAVI), designed as a stronger competitor to CNNAI rather than a return of SCWI. Mechanism sketch: (1) Keep the sign inversion — a rating of 1 is comprehended as a defect, per-cue defect magnitude d_j = v_j + tau*v_j^2 with tau in [0.35, 0.65] (a wider, higher range than SCWI's, needed for Experiment 1's +2.88 near-knife excess). (2) NEW: within-option diminishing sensitivity — the option's subjective defect load is D = (sum_j d_j * x_j)^kappa with kappa in [0.55, 0.85] (or equivalently a log-compressive map), so an option's value is -D. Small stacks (near-knife cells like AL, S-cells, M-cells) keep near-linear sharp margins, while large stacked endorsements grow sub-proportionally aversive — this flattens the high-ratio psychometrics that both current theories overshoot (Exp 10's 5x0.90-vs-11x0.50 kill cells down toward 0.60, Exp 12's rise down toward 0.30, Exp 4's disagreement-vs-agreement gap up toward 0.27 because compressed margins sit closer to the noise scale). (3) Population mixture: ~14% true guessers (beta ~ 0.02-0.10), ~70% engaged with lognormal beta (median ~2.0, log-sd 0.35, clipped [0.8, 6.0]), and ~16% deterministic tail (beta uniform [4.0, 6.5], lapse 0.02-0.04) — this reproduces Experiment 2's g ≈ 0.09 (a small but nonzero near-ceiling bloc, refuting both CNNAI's 0.00 and SCWI's 0.36) while keeping population means CNNAI-like on Exps 5-9. (4) Context elasticity retained but recalibrated: per-bucket eta redraw keyed on the rounded mean endorsed validity (as in CNNAI), with the stable-to-redraw variance ratio set for latent cross-context consistency r ≈ 0.20-0.25, matching Experiment 11's observed 0.196 between SCWI's 0.37 and CNNAI's 0.11. (5) Softmax(beta * (D_B - D_A)) plus symmetric lapse (0.03-0.09 engaged) and per-trial attention diffusion (sd ~0.05). This theory differs from SCWI by the compressive nonlinearity, the smaller deterministic bloc, and the context-keyed elasticity; it differs from CNNAI by the stronger supralinear per-cue contrast, the explicit deterministic tail, and the compression that CNNAI lacks. Parameter ranges should be tuned so that: Exp 1 AL excess lands in [+2.4, +3.2]; Exp 2 g in [0.06, 0.15]; Exp 10 kill-composite in [0.55, 0.65]; Exp 12 rise in [0.22, 0.36]; Exp 11 cross-ladder correlation in [0.15, 0.30].


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Compressive Anti-Validity Integration with a Moderate Deterministic Tail (CAVI, iter 2). Subjects integrate all binary expert ratings into a per-option subjective DEFECT LOAD, comprehending a rating of 1 as a defect (sign inversion). The per-cue defect magnitude is supralinear in the instructed validity, d_j = v_j + tau*v_j^2, modulated by a context elasticity (v_j/v_ref)^eta keyed on the bucketed mean endorsed validity. The within-option diminishing sensitivity is now an OFFSET (two-regime) map rather than a pure power: D = S for S < s0 (s0 = 3.0) and D = s0*(S/s0)^kappa for S >= s0 — near-identity (linear, sharp margins) at small-to-moderate stacks, compressive only for large endorsement stacks. Choice is softmax(beta*(D_B - D_A)) with symmetric lapse, per-trial attention diffusion (sd 0.05), and a three-part population: ~14% true guessers, ~70% engaged (lognormal beta, median ~2.0), and ~16% deterministic tail that is now nearly linear (kappa 0.92-1.0) and hotter (beta 4.5-7.5) — the confidently inverted subjects compress least, which both sharpens near-knife anti-validity adherence and lands their linear-margin fitted sensitivity inside the near-ceiling ramp.

    # Compressive Anti-Validity Integration with a Moderate Deterministic
    # Tail (CAVI), iter 2 -- offset-compression recalibration per the
    # iter-1 critic diagnosis. Mechanism family UNCHANGED (sign-inverted
    # supralinear anti-validity defect weights, context-keyed elasticity,
    # within-option diminishing sensitivity, three-part population).
    # Changes vs the accepted iter-1 base:
    #   (A) PURE POWER COMPRESSION -> TWO-REGIME OFFSET MAP:
    #       D = S for S < s0 (s0 = 3.0) and D = s0*(S/s0)^kappa for
    #       S >= s0. The pure power form compressed margins
    #       PROPORTIONALLY at every scale (local slope
    #       kappa*S^(kappa-1) < 1 even at the AL cells' S ~ 3.6-3.9),
    #       roughly halving exactly the small-to-moderate margins that
    #       Exps 5-8 and 11 need. The offset map is the IDENTITY below
    #       s0 and compressive only for large stacks, so near-knife and
    #       adherence cells recover their linear sharpness while the
    #       high-ratio cells (S ~ 5-12) stay compressed (Exp 10's rise
    #       is preserved).
    #   (B) DETERMINISTIC TAIL MADE NEARLY LINEAR AND HOTTER:
    #       kappa 0.78-0.85 -> 0.92-1.0, beta [4.0, 6.5] -> [4.5, 7.5].
    #       The Exp-12 g metric fits a LINEAR-margin softmax, so the
    #       tail's fitted bhat ~ beta * local compression slope; with
    #       kappa ~ 1 the slope is ~0.9-1.0 and a larger share of the
    #       tail lands inside the [3.0, 4.2] ramp, producing
    #       g ~ 0.06-0.15 (real 0.091) instead of 0.02.
    #   (C) STABLE ETA SHARE RICHENED: eta_base sd 0.10 -> 0.15 with the
    #       per-context redraw sd cut 0.20 -> 0.15 (eta-space latent
    #       consistency r ~ 0.5). The iter-1 r ~ 0.20 in eta space
    #       compressed to an observed cross-ladder correlation of only
    #       0.067 because near-saturated per-ladder choice rates shrink
    #       the correlation; the richer stable component restores the
    #       observed Exp-9 value toward ~0.2. The bucketed-mean context
    #       key is unchanged (it still separates the 0.50- and
    #       0.60-ladders: buckets ~0.6 vs ~0.7).
    #   (D) Everything else -- tau range [0.35, 0.65], the 14/70/16
    #       mixture, lapse ranges, attention diffusion (sd 0.05), and
    #       the softmax -- is untouched, per the critic's instruction.

`rationale`:
This is the critic-prescribed minimal-diff recalibration of the ACCEPTED iter-1 CAVI base; the mechanism family, parameter names, and everything the critic said to keep (tau range [0.35, 0.65], the 14/70/16 mixture, lapse ranges, attention diffusion sd 0.05, the bucketed-mean context key) are untouched. Four edits: (1) OFFSET COMPRESSION. The iter-1 diagnosis was exactly right: a pure power map D = S^kappa has local slope kappa*S^(kappa-1) < 1 at EVERY scale above 1, so even 'small' stacks like the AL cells (S ~ 3.6-3.9) had their ~0.31 margin roughly halved, and the same halving softened the Exps 5-8 adherence composites and deflated the Exp-12 linear-margin MLE fits. The two-regime map D = S for S < s0 = 3.0, s0*(S/s0)^kappa above, is the identity at small-to-moderate S: the AL margin stays ~0.30 for the tail and ~0.20 (slope ~0.65) for the engaged bulk, the Exp 5 cells (e.g. 2x1.00 vs 5x0.50, margin 0.75) recover sigmoid(beta*0.5) ~ 0.73 adherence, and the Exp 8 kill cells (margins 0.09-0.35 at tau below the 0.645 knife) sharpen toward ~0.57-0.60 — while the Exp-10 high-ratio cells (S ~ 5-12) remain compressed, holding the round's headline win (estimated rise ~0.30 vs real 0.296; the twin-kill ladder-1 cell sits at the tau = 0.5 knife where its margin is ~0 either way). (2) TAIL NEARLY LINEAR AND HOTTER: kappa [0.92, 1.0] and beta [4.5, 7.5] mean the tail's effective linear-margin slope is beta*~0.95, so its Exp-12 fitted bhat lands in the [3.0, 4.2] ramp (g ~ 0.10-0.15 vs the iter-1 0.020 and real 0.091), and its near-knife anti-validity choices sharpen (AL anti-rate ~0.85, Exp 5-8 adherence ~0.9), lifting the Exps 5-8 composites and the Exp-11 excess (from 1.12 toward ~1.6-1.9 — still short of the real 2.88, but the largest in-family gain available without distorting the well-fit Exps 1-4). (3) STABLE ETA SHARE DOUBLED (sd 0.15 stable vs 0.15 redraw, latent r ~ 0.5): the iter-1 observed cross-ladder correlation (0.067) fell far below the by-construction 0.20 because near-saturated per-ladder choice rates compress eta-space consistency into choice space; the richer stable component (plus the tail's stable hot beta/tau, which are also cross-ladder traits) restores the observed Exp-9 correlation toward the real 0.196 while the unchanged bucketed-mean key keeps the 0.50- and 0.60-ladders on independent redraws (buckets 0.6 vs 0.7). (4) No other changes. Expected net profile: Exps 1-4 essentially held (Exp 1 ~ -0.18 to -0.19, Exp 3 ~ 0.14, Exp 4 improves toward ~0.17 since sharper anti-validity subjects follow the tally winner less on conflict trials, Exp 2 improves toward ~0.24 as restored agree-trial margins strengthen the anti-follow), Exp 10 held near 0.29-0.33, and simultaneous gains on Exps 5 (0.46 -> ~0.68), 6 (0.47 -> ~0.60), 7 (0.53 -> ~0.63), 8 (0.52 -> ~0.58), 9 (0.07 -> ~0.15-0.25), 11 (1.12 -> ~1.6-1.9), and 12 (0.02 -> ~0.10-0.14) — a strict aggregate improvement over the iter-1 loss of 0.1319, which should clear the accept gate.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1319 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1783 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1319.

    all remaining trials its choice probability tracks the raw count
    margin, which is strongly ANTI-correlated with D across this design
    (the tally winner is almost always the weighted-margin loser). So

    # Kill-composite: fraction of choices falling on the HIGH-validity stack
    # across the parameter-free sign-kill trials of this design.
    #
    # Kill trials pit a endorsements on higher-validity cues against b
    # endorsements on lower-validity cues (all other cues 0 for both
    # options, disjoint supports, each stack within one validity block)
    # at count ratios that lie strictly between the two theories'
    # weight-ratio windows:
    #   5 x 0.90 vs 7 x 0.70   (r = 1.40)
    #   9 x 0.70 vs 14 x 0.50  (r = 1.556)

    # SCWI's ratio window w(v_h)/w(v_l) is BELOW each r for every admissible
    # tau, so SCWI always prefers the high-validity stack. PAHI's power-law
    # window is ABOVE each r for every admissible gamma, so PAHI always
    # prefers the low-validity stack. The metric is the fraction of kill
    # trials on which the subject chose the high-validity stack; mirrored
    # versions of each kill pair absorb side bias. It is well defined on
    # the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject slice (18 kill trials

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: CAVI is a faithful implementation of the arbiter's prescribed family (sign-inverted supralinear defect weights, within-option compression, three-part population mixture, context-keyed elasticity), and it clears the gate. The fit is genuinely excellent on the psychometric-shape metrics: Exp 1 (-0.180 vs -0.175), Exp 3 (0.140 vs 0.123), Exp 4 (0.186 vs 0.163), and — the round's headline win — Exp 10's rise (0.292 vs 0.296, where every prior theory overshot or undershot). The compression lever works exactly as intended on the high-ratio cells. However, the same compression is doing collateral damage everywhere margins are SMALL-to-MODERATE, and the candidate systematically undershoots the anti-validity adherence bloc: Exp 5 (0.456 vs 0.684), Exp 6 (0.474 vs 0.630), Exp 7 (0.529 vs 0.646), Exp 8 (0.522 vs 0.604, just below the arbiter's [0.55, 0.65] window), Exp 9 (0.067 vs 0.196, below the [0.15, 0.30] window), Exp 11 (1.12 vs 2.88 — far below the arbiter's [+2.4, +3.2] target, and even below the proposer's own 1.2-1.5 prediction), and Exp 12 (0.020 vs 0.091, below the [0.06, 0.15] window). The diagnosis is mechanical, not conceptual: a pure power map D = S^kappa compresses margins PROPORTIONALLY at every scale. For S > 1, the local margin slope is kappa*S^(kappa-1) < 1, so even 'small' stacks like Exp 11's AL cells (S ≈ 3.6-3.9, margin ≈ 0.28 uncompressed) get their margin roughly halved (≈ 0.14) — the theory's claim that 'small stacks keep near-linear sharp margins' is false for the power form whenever S > 1. The same halving softens the Exp 5-7 adherence cells and deflates the Exp 12 per-subject MLE beta fits (the metric fits a LINEAR-margin softmax, so the fitted bhat is the true beta scaled down by the compression slope, pushing the 16% deterministic tail below the [3.0, 4.2] ramp). Separately, the Exp 9 cross-ladder correlation (0.067) falls short of the by-construction r ≈ 0.20 because the eta-space consistency does not transfer linearly to choice-rate space: near-saturated per-ladder choice rates compress the correlation, so the stable/redraw variance split needs to be richer in the stable component than 0.20 to land at an observed 0.196.
Rationale: The candidate was accepted, so build on it — but it is not shippable yet: it misses the arbiter's explicit target windows on four experiments (8, 9, 11, 12) and undershoots real data by 0.12-0.23 on Exps 5-7. All failures point at ONE miscalibration, so the fix is a minor in-family adjustment, not a redesign: (1) Replace the pure power compression with an OFFSET/affine form that is near-identity at small S and compressive only at large S — e.g. D = (1 + S)^kappa - 1, or a two-regime map D = S for S < s0 and s0*(S/s0)^kappa for S >= s0 with s0 ≈ 2-3. This preserves the Exp 10 win (high-ratio cells have S ≈ 5-12 and stay compressed) while restoring near-linear margins on the AL cells (Exp 11 should rise from 1.12 toward the 2.4-2.9 range), the Exp 5-7 adherence composites (toward 0.60-0.68), and Exp 8's kill composite (into [0.55, 0.65]). (2) For Exp 12's g: the deterministic tail's effective slope is beta * kappa*S^(kappa-1); with the offset compression the tail's fitted bhat recovers, but also push the tail's kappa to [0.92, 1.0] (fully linear for the confidently inverted) and consider widening tail beta to [4.5, 7.5] so a larger share of tail subjects land bhat inside the [3.0, 4.2] ramp; target g ≈ 0.06-0.10. (3) For Exp 9: raise the stable share of eta — e.g. stable sd 0.15 with redraw sd 0.15 (eta-space r ≈ 0.5) — so that after choice-rate saturation the observed cross-ladder correlation lands near 0.20; verify the bucketed-mean key still separates the 0.50- and 0.60-ladders (it does: buckets ≈ 0.6 vs 0.7). (4) Keep everything else fixed: the supralinear tau range, the 14/70/16 mixture proportions, the lapse ranges, the attention diffusion, and the Exp 1-4 parameterization are all performing at or near the real values and should not be touched. Expected net effect: Exp 11 → ~2.4-2.9, Exps 5-7 → ~0.60-0.68, Exp 8 → ~0.57-0.62, Exp 9 → ~0.18-0.22, Exp 12 → ~0.06-0.09, with Exps 1-4 and 10 held (re-check Exp 10 after the compression change: the offset form slightly REDUCES compression at the twin-kill cells (S ≈ 4-5), which may nudge the rise up from 0.29 — if it drifts above 0.36, lower s0 or kappa slightly to compensate).

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1319 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1783 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).

  "interpretation": "Iter 2 was REJECTED by the gate (loss 0.1783 vs the iter-1 base's 0.1319), and the per-experiment pattern cleanly identifies which of the three edits helped and which hurt. What HELPED: the offset (two-regime) compression. Exp 11 rose 1.12 \u2192 1.56 (toward the real 2.88), Exp 5 rose 0.456 \u2192 0.508 (toward 0.684), Exp 2 rose 0.202 \u2192 0.221 (toward 0.274), and Exps 3/10 stayed acceptable. What HURT, badly: the eta enrichment (change C) plus the hot, near-linear tail now DRAWING eta (change B's side effect). Exp 9 exploded from 0.067 to 0.595 against a real value of 0.196 \u2014 a 3x overshoot of the target window. Exp 8 crashed from 0.522 to 0.438 (real 0.604) \u2014 BELOW chance, which is diagnostic: a large mass of hot subjects now flips to the LOW-validity stack on the 5x0.90-vs-7x0.70 knife cells. Mechanically, the elasticity multiplier (v_h/v_ref)^eta / (v_l/v_ref)^eta inflates the effective defect-weight ratio past the count ratio (1.40) on those cells at eta \u2248 0.25; with the enriched eta distribution (mean 0.12, sd ~0.21, now including the 16% hot tail) a substantial bloc sits past that flip, and with tail beta 4.5-7.5 they flip deterministically. The same near-linear hot tail saturates both Exp 9 ladders identically, which is what catapulted the cross-ladder correlation to 0.595. Collateral damage from the same source: Exp 6 dropped 0.474 \u2192 0.435 (same knife-flip mechanism at high eta), Exp 4 dropped 0.186 \u2192 0.118 (flipped subjects follow the anti-validity loser even more), and Exp 1's slope went over-negative (-0.180 \u2192 -0.219 vs real -0.175). Meanwhile the change that was specifically aimed at Exp 12 (tail kappa 0.92-1.0, beta 4.5-7.5) delivered nothing: g moved only 0.020 \u2192 0.026 against a real 0.091. So change (B) bought nothing where it was aimed and cost where it wasn't; change (C) overshot ~3x past its target; change (A) is the one lever that moved things in the right direction and should be kept and pushed further.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Build on the unchanged iter-1 accepted base with a partial-retention, partial-reversion diff. Do NOT repeat the full eta enrichment \u2014 the gate rejected it, and the observed-correlation response is strongly saturating (a ~2x stable-share change moved Exp 9 from 0.067 to 0.595), so take a fractional step. Concretely: (1) REVERT the eta split most of the way back to iter 1: stable eta_base sd ~0.11-0.12 with per-context redraw sd ~0.18-0.19 (between iter 1's 0.10/0.20 and iter 2's 0.15/0.15), and PIN the deterministic tail's eta_base to a fixed small value (~0.05, no ndtri draw). The tail's stable hot beta and tau are already cross-ladder traits and provide a modest, controlled consistency boost on Exp 9 (from 0.067 toward ~0.15-0.20) without flipping the Exp 6/8 knife cells \u2014 the iter-2 Exp 8 sub-0.5 crash and the Exp 6/4/1 regressions should all revert with this single change. (2) KEEP the offset compression but RAISE s0 from 3.0 to ~3.8-4.2. The remaining Exp 11 shortfall (1.56 vs 2.88) lives in the fact that the AL cells' stacks (S \u2248 3.6-3.9) still sit ABOVE s0 = 3.0 and get compressed for the engaged bulk (local slope ~0.65-0.7, margin ~0.30 \u2192 ~0.21). With s0 \u2248 4.0 the AL cells are fully in the identity regime for everyone: back-of-envelope, engaged sigmoid(2.0*0.30) \u2248 0.65, tail sigmoid(5*0.30) \u2248 0.82, guessers 0.5 \u2192 population anti-rate \u2248 0.68, which lands the mean excess near the real 2.88 (vs 1.56 now). Raising s0 also puts Exp 6's 4-5-cue low stacks (S \u2248 3.4-4.3) in or near the identity regime, raising top-cue adherence toward 0.63. The Exp 10 diagnostic stacks (S \u2248 6-9) remain compressed; if the rise drifts above ~0.33, trim the engaged kappa upper bound from 0.85 to ~0.80 to compensate \u2014 do not touch the rest of the kappa range. (3) Exp 12: the tail re-targeting failed (g stuck at 0.026), which points to a different cap \u2014 the per-trial attention diffusion (sd 0.05) injects margin noise (sd roughly 0.2-0.3 on the metric's fitted margins of 0.5-1.3) that deflates every subject's fitted bhat below the [3.0, 4.2] ramp regardless of true beta. Reduce the attention diffusion sd to ~0.03-0.04 (still within the arbiter's '~0.05' prescription) so the tail's fitted bhat can actually reach the ramp; this also nudges the undershooting Exps 5-8 up slightly, which is the right direction. (4) Leave everything else untouched: tau range [0.35, 0.65], the 14/70/16 mixture, lapse ranges, the bucketed-mean context key, and the softmax are all performing and were explicitly flagged to keep. Expected net profile: Exps 1-4 revert to their iter-1 near-real values (Exp 1 ~ -0.18, Exp 4 ~ 0.17-0.19), Exp 11 \u2192 ~2.4-2.9, Exps 5-7 \u2192 0.55-0.65, Exp 8 \u2192 0.55-0.62, Exp 9 \u2192 0.12-0.22, Exp 10 held near 0.30, Exp 12 \u2192 0.06-0.10 \u2014 which should strictly beat the 0.1319 base."
