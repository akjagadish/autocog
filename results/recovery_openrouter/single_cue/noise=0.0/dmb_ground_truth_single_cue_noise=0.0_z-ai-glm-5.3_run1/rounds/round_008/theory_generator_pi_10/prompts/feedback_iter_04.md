# feedback_iter_04

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_9`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_8_1`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_8_1`).

Replace pi_8_1 with a 'Small-Gap Composition-Gated Outlier Distrust' (SG-CGD) theory: (i) KEEP the shared, well-validated machinery verbatim — sign-vote tallying, trust plateau [v_lo, v_hi] with ceiling ~0.981 and shallow within-plateau tilt, consensus-gated chance flank with partial-ceiling promotion (kappa_gate*w_p), low-gain softmax plus uniform lapse. (ii) Outlier distrust: bounded, saturating shrinkage toward a floor with the peaked kernel centered at g_star ~ 0.05 (BODT's location, confirmed by Exps 14/15), with a RIGHT WALL steep enough that distrust has essentially receded by gap ~0.09 (s_r ~ 0.025) — this fixes Exps 1/2, where observed following at gap 0.09 (0.72 double-99 cells; 0.46 follow index) demands w_top ~ 0 to +0.25. (iii) Add a small POSITIVE 'edge credibility' ramp for well-separated outliers: for gap >= ~0.09, w_top rises toward the plateau value (a 99% expert sitting far above a coherent 0.85-0.90 rung is treated as genuinely more informative, not fraudulent), capturing Exp 1's 0.72 and Exp 18's 0.55 at gap 0.14. (iv) Composition amplification exists ONLY as a narrow near-kernel centered g_near ~ 0.03-0.04 (width ~0.015), gated by a chance-fraction logistic with c_half ~ 0.40-0.45, and is STRUCTURALLY INERT for gap >= ~0.07 — this reproduces the c_frac modulation at gap 0.05 (Exp 15: 0.29 at c_frac 0.55; Exp 14: 0.45 at c_frac 0.30) while guaranteeing no amplification at gaps 0.09-0.14 (Exps 1, 18). (v) NO far-fraud route below gap ~0.15; if any far route is retained at all, center it at g_far >= 0.18 with very sharp walls (EOBOT's placement), so it is closed on every panel tested here. (vi) Nudge the uniform-skepticism floor / base distrust slightly upward relative to both current calibrations to close the Exp 9 residual (observed anti-follow 0.58 vs predicted 0.40-0.45). Calibration targets across all 18 experiments: Exp 1 ~0.70, Exp 2 ~0.46, Exp 14 ~0.45, Exp 15 ~0.29, Exp 16 ~0.57, Exp 17 ~0.52, Exp 18 ~0.55, Exp 9 ~0.55-0.60, with all shared-machinery experiments (3-8, 10-13) held within their current ~0.01-0.03 agreement. This new theory is a direct, falsifiable competitor to EOBOT: it agrees with EOBOT on the small-gap composition gate but predicts the opposite sign of EOBOT's relocated peak at gap 0.09, where the incumbent is now known to over-distrust.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
SG-CGD (Small-Gap Composition-Gated Outlier Distrust), half-depth uniform-skepticism edition. Subjects integrate every binary expert rating as a sign vote into a zero-sum evidence score with subjective weights computed relative to the panel: a tilted trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] (ceiling just above 0.98), a consensus-gated chance flank with partial-ceiling promotion, and an outlier branch for above-ceiling claims consisting of (a) a bounded, saturating base distrust peaked at gap ~0.088 sitting on a uniform-skepticism floor, (b) a near-kernel composition amplification (narrow Gaussian at gap ~0.035, chance-fraction gate, sig_gap-throttled) that deepens distrust only of small-edge outliers on chance-laden scales, (c) a far-fraud route at gap ~0.185, and (d) a composition-gated edge-credibility ramp that promotes a well-separated 99% expert back toward plateau trust when the surrounding scale is unreliable. The single theoretical claim updated this round: the uniform-skepticism floor e_min — the residual distrust applied to a panel-max expert even when the gap kernel is silent (dense ladders, gap ~0.05 cells) — sits at a MODERATE depth (~0.36), roughly halfway between the near-zero floor of the accepted calibration and the deep floor of the rejected overshoot. This floor is what generates the empirically required mild anti-follow of 99% experts on dense validity ladders (Exp 7) without unbounded sign flips. Choice is a low-gain softmax plus uniform lapse.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # SG-CGD: Small-Gap Composition-Gated Outlier Distrust with a
    # composition-gated edge-credibility ramp, half-depth-floor edition.
    # Stimulus: array of shape (2, n_features); row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B; entries are binary expert ratings (0/1).
    # Each feature j casts a sign vote sign(a_j - b_j), weighted by a
    # subjective trust function of the expert's STATED validity v,
    # evaluated RELATIVE to the panel:
    #   (i) TRUST PLATEAU with shallow tilt: all v in [v_lo, v_hi]
    #       (v_hi just above 0.98, so a 98% expert stays INSIDE the
    #       plateau) get approximately equal weight w_p, with a
    #       within-band tilt so higher-validity cues slightly
    #       outrank lower ones.
    #  (ii) CHANCE FLANK + CONSENSUS GATE: v near 0.5 gets a small
    #       negative weight (-kappa_lo at v=0.5, rising linearly to
    #       the tilted plateau at v_lo). When an above-ceiling claim
    #       is present the flank is gated and chance cues are
    #       PROMOTED to a partial ceiling kappa_gate*w_p.
    # (iii) BOUNDED BASE DISTRUST of the panel-max expert: a
    #       saturating shrinkage toward a SHALLOW floor,
    #         w_base = w_floor + (w_p - w_floor)*exp(-rho_e*E)
    #       with E = max(peaked gap kernel, e_min); the kernel peaks
    #       at gap ~0.088 (steep left wall s_l, wide right shoulder
    #       s_r). The UNIFORM-SKEPTICISM FLOOR e_min is the single
    #       lever moved this round: raised from ~0.15 to ~0.36
    #       (half the rejected overshoot depth), so dense-ladder
    #       and gap-0.05 outliers carry a moderate residual
    #       distrust even where the gap kernel is silent.
    #  (iv) NEAR-KERNEL COMPOSITION AMPLIFICATION (small-gap gate):
    #         comp_near = c_near * sig_gap * L(gap) * G(c_frac)
    #       L is a NARROW Gaussian centered g_near ~ 0.035 (inert for
    #       gap >= 0.07); G is a chance-fraction logistic. The
    #       sig_gap factor is ESSENTIAL and retained: it throttles
    #       the route on dense ladders (gap ~ 0.01), which protects
    #       the cliff-conflict cells from spurious anti-votes.
    #  (v) FAR-FRAUD ROUTE: comp_far = c_far * sig_gap * F(gap) *
    #       G_far(c_frac), F a SHARP logistic at g_far ~ 0.185 with
    #       its own chance gate: closed on every gap 0.09-0.14 panel
    #       tested here, open for far outliers over chance-laden
    #       panels (gap >= ~0.18).
    # (vi) COMPOSITION-GATED EDGE-CREDIBILITY RAMP: for gap >= ~0.075,
    #       cred = c_cred * R(gap) * Q(c_frac), capped at the plateau
    #       value. On a chance-laden panel a well-separated 99%
    #       expert is the only credible voice and is promoted back
    #       toward plateau trust; on a coherent-ladder panel the ramp
    #       stays closed and residual kernel distrust persists.
    # Choice is a low-gain softmax (inverse temperature beta) over
    # the two mirrored scores, plus a uniform lapse (epsilon).

`rationale`:
This is the critic-prescribed half-depth re-edit of the single e_min lever on the ACCEPTED iter-3 base. The mechanism code is byte-identical to the running-best candidate; exactly ONE parameter box moves (e_min: [0.13, 0.17] -> [0.32, 0.40], midpoint ~0.36, inside the critic's 0.30-0.45 window and roughly half the rejected iter-4 depth of ~0.59). The rejected iter-4 candidate's w_floor dip is NOT present here — w_floor stays at the accepted iter-3 box [-0.24, -0.17] — and every other parameter (near-route gate, credibility ramp, kernel placement, shared machinery, far-fraud route) is pinned to the accepted values, exactly as the iter-4 feedback instructs after two failed attempts established those are calibrated.

Pre-submission panel audit with the actual panel numbers, as requested (using box midpoints: w_p=0.90, w_floor=-0.205, rho_e=1.175, e_min=0.36):

- Dense ladders (gap ~0.01, kernel ~0, E = e_min = 0.36): w_base = -0.205 + 1.105*exp(-1.175*0.36) = -0.205 + 1.105*0.655 = +0.52. At the iter-3 floor (e_min=0.15) the same arithmetic gives +0.74, so the edit lowers dense-ladder w_top by ~0.22 per 99% expert. Exp 7 (anti-follow, real 0.580, iter-3 0.369): the two 99% experts' combined vote drops by ~0.44 trusted-cue units on the discriminating trials, moving anti-follow toward ~0.42-0.46 — roughly half of iter-4's gain (0.448) retained, as the endpoint interpolation predicts. Exp 9 (real 0.560, iter-3 0.529): the small extra distrust moves it to ~0.55-0.57, i.e. ON target rather than iter-4's 0.640 overshoot. Exp 10 (real 0.599, iter-3 0.603): follow drops to ~0.56-0.57, inside the >=0.56 guardrail with margin.

- Gap-0.05 cells (kernel ~0, E = e_min): w_base moves +0.74 -> +0.52. Exp 13 (c_frac 0.556, G~0.77, comp_near ~1.15): w_top -0.50 -> -0.71, follow 0.320 -> ~0.26 (real 0.290) — the endpoint interpolation's landing zone. Exp 12 (c_frac 0.375, G~0.19, comp_near ~0.29): w_top ~0.38 -> ~0.17, follow 0.480 -> ~0.44 (real 0.4525). Exp 14 (coherent, c_frac 0.30, G~0.16): w_top 0.43 -> 0.23, follow 0.558 -> ~0.52-0.53, at the >=0.52 guardrail edge — the accepted cost. Exp 15 (c_frac ~0.60, gate fully open, comp_near ~1.4): the extra ~0.22 of floor distrust adds anti-follow on a cell that has been stuck at 0.42 vs real 0.483 — a small favorable drift, not chased.

- Kernel-dominated cells (gap ~0.09, E = kernel ~ 1): e_min is mechanically inert. Exps 17/18 are unchanged from the accepted base (0.619/0.423), as are Exps 16 (gap 0.14, kernel 0.51 > 0.36) and 6 (far-route dominated). No-outlier experiments (1-5, 8) are structurally untouched.

Where my audit and the critic's endpoint interpolation could disagree (Exps 13/14, where I project slightly past the interpolation's landing zones), I follow the critic's explicit instruction to trust the interpolation and choose the shallower side: e_min's box TOP is 0.40, not 0.45, so the deepest sampled subject stays at the interpolation's upper edge. Expected movement vs the accepted base: Exp 7 0.369 -> ~0.42-0.45, Exp 9 0.529 -> ~0.56, Exp 12 0.480 -> ~0.44, Exp 13 0.320 -> ~0.26-0.28, with Exps 3-6/8/10/11/16/17/18 held within ~0.01-0.04 — a projected aggregate loss near ~0.050-0.055, comfortably below the 0.0622 gate floor. Exps 15 and 17 remain accepted structural residuals this round per the feedback.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0626 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0715 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0622 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0771 -> REJECTED
- iter 5 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0605 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 5 at loss=0.0605.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # "Double-99 endorsement avoidance" metric.
    #
    # On every trial, identify whether BOTH top-validity experts (the two
    # tied 0.99 experts, features 0 and 1 of the fixed panel
    # [0.99, 0.99, 0.94, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]) cast the SAME
    # vote (both favor A, or both favor B). On those trials, record
    # whether the subject chose the option the 0.99 pair endorsed.
    # The metric is the proportion of such choices.
    #
    # This isolates the single structural disagreement between CREDT and
    # BODT on this panel: the DEPTH of distrust of a 0.99 claim sitting
    # gap=0.05 above its next rung on a chance-laden panel.
    #   CREDT: w_top ~ -1.7 per 99% expert  -> the endorsement is worth
    #          roughly two trusted cues AGAINST -> p(pick endorsed) ~ 0.16
    #          (box ~[0.12, 0.19]).
    #   BODT:  w_top ~ -0.14 per 99% expert -> the endorsement is worth
    #          roughly nothing -> p(pick endorsed) ~ 0.40 (box ~[0.35, 0.47]).
    # The two predicted boxes are disjoint by ~0.2 in probability units.
    # Mirror trials (e.g., trials 1/2, 3/4, 6/7, 8/9, 16/17) put the 99-pair
    # on opposite sides, so pure A/B side bias cancels.
    # Works identically on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's
    # slice (each subject has 14 qualifying trial types x 4 reps = 56 rows).

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """
    Global outlier-endorsement follow index, side-balanced.

    Uses every trial on which the 0.99-validity outlier expert (feature
    index 0 in this design) actually discriminates the two options (his
    rating is 1 for exactly one of A/B). On those trials we ask: did the
    subject choose the side the outlier endorsed? The index averages the
    follow rate over outlier-endorses-A trials and outlier-endorses-B
    trials separately, so pure display/side bias cancels.

    These are trials 1-8 and 20-24 of the design (R0-R5, R3m, R5m, V1,
    V2, V1m, K1, K2), 13 trial types x 3 reps = 39 trials per subject.

    BODT (deep, composition-amplified outlier distrust: w(0.99) ~ -1.8
    to -3.5 in chance-cue units) predicts subjects systematically REJECT
    the outlier-endorsed side: index ~ 0.32 (centers .20/.24/.29/.34/.39/
    .45 on R0-R5, .34/.46 on the mirrors, ~.21 on the V cells, .42/.36 on
    K1/K2). CREDT (shallow distrust: w(0.99) ~ -0.7 to -1.3, coin-flippers
    near-exchangeable with experts) predicts the outlier's endorsement
    still carries the day on balance: index ~ 0.51 (R-ladder crosses 0.5
    at k~2). The two predicted values are separated by ~0.19 in mean
    against a per-subject SD of ~0.09-0.11 (binomial noise over 39 trials
    plus parameter heterogeneity), giving Welch t of order 6-8 at N=25.

    #
    # The design's single structural disagreement is the weight assigned to
    # the 0.99 experts on a majority-chance panel with a 0.09 edge over the
    # 0.90 rung: EOBOT's relocated bounded kernel yields only a MILD anti-vote
    # (w(0.99) ~ -0.28, about half a chance cue against), while BODT's open
    # far-fraud composition route yields a deep anti-vote (w(0.99) ~ -1.9,
    # about three chance cues against). The cleanest behavioral readout of
    # that single lever is: on trials where ONE option wins BOTH 0.99 experts
    # (features 0 and 1) and the other wins neither, how often does the
    # subject follow the double-99 endorsement?

    # These are exactly trials 1, 2 (M1), 11, 12 (V3), 19-23 (D-family),

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a genuine step forward and was correctly accepted by the gate: it is the only theory in the pool that simultaneously fits the gap-0.09 pair in the right direction (Exp 17: 0.614 vs real 0.721; Exp 18: 0.399 vs real 0.464 — compare pi_8_1 at 0.098/0.496 and pi_9 at 0.462/0.326, each of which sacrifices one of the two). The composition-gated edge-credibility ramp is doing real work, and the shared-machinery experiments (3, 6, 8, 10, 11) are essentially locked in (|diff| <= 0.009). The proposer's documented deviation from the arbiter's g_star ~ 0.05 kernel placement is empirically vindicated: with a 0.05-centered kernel receding by 0.09, Exp 18 (real 0.464 at c_frac 0.30) could not be fit without destroying Exp 14's coherent-panel gradient. However, the fit is not yet shippable. Decomposing the aggregate loss, a single cell dominates: Experiment 7 (anti-follow of the 99% expert: real 0.580, candidate 0.380, |diff| = 0.20) contributes roughly 60% of the total squared error by itself. The remaining misses cluster into two coherent, in-family-fixable groups: (a) under-following at gap 0.09 — Exp 17 (-0.107) and Exp 18 (-0.064) both need w_top nudged upward; (b) under-distrusting at gap 0.05 on chance-laden panels — Exp 13 (0.336 vs 0.290), Exp 15 (follow 0.577 vs real 0.517), and mildly Exp 12 (0.470 vs 0.453) and Exp 9 (0.522 vs 0.560). Crucially, groups (a) and (b) are separable by gap (0.09 vs 0.05) and by c_frac, so they can be tuned without fighting each other.
Rationale: Regenerate — but this is a tuning pass on an accepted base, not a redesign; keep the SG-CGD architecture exactly as prescribed. Concretely: (1) ATTACK EXP 7, the dominant residual. The panel is a dense validity ladder with a small top gap and several chance cues, so the near-kernel composition route is the only in-family lever that can reach it without touching the shared machinery: raise c_near (from [2.5, 3.0] toward [3.2, 3.8]) and widen s_near modestly (toward [0.017, 0.022]) so L(gap ~ 0.01-0.02) is no longer attenuated; verify Exp 14 (gap 0.05, coherent, gate closed) and Exps 3-8 hold. (2) Deepen small-gap chance-laden distrust to close Exps 13/15: lower c_half toward [0.40, 0.44] — this closes the gate further on coherent panels (protecting Exp 14) while opening it on c_frac ~ 0.55-0.60 panels; the c_near raise in (1) reinforces this. (3) Raise gap-0.09 following for Exps 17/18: increase c_cred (toward [1.1, 1.45]) and/or lower c_cred_half toward [0.45, 0.50] so the ramp fires more decisively on Exp 17's c_frac 0.727 panel, and lift w_floor from ~-0.28 toward ~-0.18 (or reduce rho_e slightly) so the residual kernel distrust at gap 0.09 on Exp 18's coherent ladder is shallower. Exp 16 (gap 0.14, currently +0.021 high) tolerates a small w_floor raise but is the guardrail — do not overshoot it past ~0.60. (4) Leave the far-fraud route, consensus gate, softmax, and lapse untouched. Expected effect: Exp 7 from 0.38 toward ~0.50-0.55, Exps 13/15/12/9 each closed by half or more, Exps 17/18 to within ~0.04, with all currently-good cells held. Since the loop guarantees the base never regresses, this targeted pass is low-risk and addresses the two largest error pools directly.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0626 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0715 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The gate rejected this candidate (loss 0.0626 -> 0.0715), and the per-experiment decomposition shows exactly why. The tuning pass had two halves, and they fared oppositely. The half aimed at the gap-0.09 pair WORKED and should be kept: the shallower w_floor/rho_e plus the sharper, higher-threshold credibility gate moved Exp 18 from -0.064 to -0.015 error, Exp 16 from +0.020 to +0.013, Exp 12 from +0.017 to +0.004, and Exp 17 from -0.107 to -0.098, with Exp 14 held. The half aimed at the small-gap composition cells BACKFIRED: Exp 9 blew up from -0.038 to +0.146 error (0.522 -> 0.706 vs real 0.560), Exp 13 overshot from +0.046 to -0.075 (0.336 -> 0.215 vs real 0.290), Exp 15 moved AWAY from target (0.423 -> 0.409 vs real 0.483), and Exps 4/5 drifted. Most damning, Exp 7 — the single cell motivating the near-route edits and ~60% of the residual error — is essentially UNMOVED (0.380 -> 0.373 vs real 0.580). Two very different near-route calibrations (iter 1: sig_gap-throttled; iter 2: unthrottled with a sharpened gate) have now produced the same Exp 7 value, which is diagnostic: the route is effectively closed on that panel under any threshold in the arbiter's prescribed 0.40-0.45 window, so its chance fraction evidently sits below the gate (or its gap attenuates L beyond rescue), while the sharpened gate simultaneously over-opens the panels it should not touch (Exps 9/13). The proposer's pre-submission arithmetic ('w_top ~ -0.1 on chance-laden dense ladders', 'Exp 13 essentially unchanged') was demonstrably wrong; a per-experiment (gap, c_frac, L, G, w_top) audit table would have caught the Exp 9/13 overshoots before submission.
Rationale: Regenerate. My iter-1 advice — lower c_half toward 0.40-0.44, raise c_near, widen s_near — was implemented in overshooting form and REJECTED by the gate, so I am not repeating it. The next pass should be a surgical revert-and-keep on the accepted iter-1 base, plus a diagnosed (not blind) attempt at Exp 7. Concretely: (1) KEEP verbatim the w_floor lift (~-0.20), gentled rho_e (~1.15), and the credibility-ramp retuning (c_cred ~1.1-1.4, c_cred_half ~0.60, s_cred ~0.055) — these delivered Exps 18/16/12/17 and are the round's real progress. (2) REVERT the near-route gate sharpening: c_half back to ~[0.44, 0.48], s_c back to ~[0.08, 0.11], and recalibrate c_near so the gap-0.05 chance-laden magnitude returns to iter-1 levels (Exp 13 ~0.33, Exp 15 recovering toward 0.48). On the sig_gap drop: the +0.18 Exp 9 jump is the signature of the un-throttled route firing on a panel sig_gap used to protect, so either restore the sig_gap factor or verify with the panel numbers that the reverted gate holds Exp 9 closed; do not keep it dropped unconditionally. (3) PIN the shared-machinery parameters (w_p, v_lo, v_hi, tilt, kappa_lo, kappa_gate, lambda_ext, g0, s_gap, beta, epsilon) to the accepted iter-1 fitted values rather than re-fitting them, so Exps 3-6/8/10/11 stop drifting (Exp 4 slipped 0.059 with no intended mechanism change). (4) For Exp 7, stop tweaking the gate — two failed attempts prove the threshold placement is not the issue. Before editing anything, compute and report the panel's actual (gap, c_frac) and the resulting (L, G, comp_near, w_top). If c_frac is below ~0.30, the composition route cannot reach Exp 7 by construction and the only in-family lever left is the uniform-skepticism floor e_min (which binds exactly where the kernel is ~0, i.e. dense ladders): raise e_min toward [0.30, 0.45] and compensate the gap-0.05 cells with a reduced c_near — a measured trade of a few hundredths on Exps 10/14/12 (guardrails: hold Exp 10 within 0.03 of 0.599, Exp 14 within 0.03 of 0.572, Exp 16 <= ~0.58) for a large Exp 7 gain. If instead the diagnostic shows Exp 7's gap is ~0.09 with near-zero c_frac, the fix belongs in the kernel depth / cred-ramp low-c_frac behavior, and the near route should be left alone. The revert-and-keep package alone should land near loss ~0.055-0.058 (below the accepted 0.0626), so the Exp 7 attempt is upside, not a prerequisite for beating the gate.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0715 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0622 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The revert-and-keep strategy worked: the gate accepted this candidate (0.0626 -> 0.0622), and the per-experiment decomposition confirms the surgical split. The kept half (shallower w_floor ~-0.20, gentled rho_e ~1.15, sharper high-threshold credibility gate) held its gains: Exp 18 at -0.041 (from -0.064 at iter 1), Exp 16 at +0.013, Exp 14 held at -0.013, Exp 5 is now essentially perfect (-0.008), and Exps 6/10/11 remain locked within 0.008. The reverted half successfully un-did the iter-2 damage: Exp 9 recovered from 0.706 to 0.529 (real 0.560), Exp 13 from 0.215 to 0.320 (real 0.290). This validates the iter-2 diagnosis that the sig_gap throttle and the gate placement, not the kept edits, caused the blowup. However, the candidate is only a marginal improvement, and the loss remains dominated by three persistent pools: Exp 7 (-0.210, ~0.044 squared error, roughly 40% of the total alone), Exp 17 (-0.102, essentially unmoved across all three iterations at 0.614/0.624/0.619 vs real 0.721), and Exp 15 (-0.067, also stuck at 0.423/0.409/0.416 vs real 0.483). Two structural facts emerge from the trajectory: (a) Exp 17 appears capped by the w_top <= w_p clamp — the arbiter-prescribed 'rises toward the plateau value' ceiling — since three different credibility-ramp calibrations all land at ~0.62; (b) Exp 7 has resisted two near-route recalibrations, and the proposer's own panel arithmetic (correctly, in my check) shows the bounded-saturating form with a shallow floor cannot push dense-ladder w_top negative. BUT the proposer declined the one lever my iter-2 advice actually named for this case — the uniform-skepticism floor e_min — on the grounds that it cannot fully reach w_top ~ -0.3. That argument proves too much: partial movement is valuable on the dominant error pool, and my own sign audit of the e_min lever shows it is favorable almost everywhere it binds. e_min binds exactly where the gap kernel is ~0: dense ladders (Exps 7, 9, 10) and gap-0.05 cells (Exps 12, 13, 15). Raising e_min from ~0.15 toward ~0.35 lowers w_base on all of those panels, and the current residuals on those very cells are signed in the anti-follow direction: Exp 7 needs more anti-follow (0.369 vs 0.580), Exp 9 needs more (+0.031), Exp 12 needs more (+0.028), Exp 13 needs more (+0.030), Exp 15 needs more (+0.067), and Exp 16 (gap 0.14, wide right shoulder, E~0.5) also benefits slightly (+0.013 too much following). The only cells it hurts are Exp 10 (currently +0.004, with ~0.03 guardrail slack) and Exp 14 (currently -0.013, ~0.02 slack) — small, bounded costs against a potential halving of the Exp 7 pool. Cells where the kernel is at peak (Exps 17, 18, gap ~0.09) are mechanically unaffected by e_min since E = max(kernel, e_min) is kernel-dominated there.
Rationale: verdict: regenerate

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0622 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0771 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The gate rejected this candidate (0.0622 -> 0.0771), and the per-experiment decomposition shows a clean, interpretable pattern: the e_min lever WORKS on its primary target but was pushed roughly twice as deep as the data allow. Gains: Exp 7 moved 0.369 -> 0.448 (real 0.580) — the largest single-iteration movement on the dominant residual pool in the entire loop — and Exp 8 (-0.046 -> +0.026), Exp 1 (-0.026 -> -0.003), Exp 3, and Exp 6 all improved. But the uniform floor is flat in gap, so it also slammed every cell where the kernel is small: Exp 9 overshot from -0.031 to +0.080 (0.529 -> 0.640 vs real 0.560), Exp 12 from +0.028 to -0.058, Exp 13 from +0.030 to -0.097 (0.320 -> 0.193 vs real 0.290), Exp 14 from -0.013 to -0.082, and Exp 10 from +0.004 to -0.075. Exp 15 — the other named target — is essentially unmoved (-0.067 -> -0.066), confirming the floor does not reach the gap-0.05 chance-laden cells the way the proposer's audit claimed. The pre-submission panel audit was again materially wrong (predicted Exp 12 ~0.45, got 0.395; Exp 13 ~0.27-0.29, got 0.193; predicted aggregate 0.050-0.055, got 0.0771). Critically, a linear interpolation between the iter-3 and iter-4 calibrations says the optimum sits near d ~ 0.5: the signed errors at the two endpoints bracket the real values on Exps 7, 9, 12, 13 (iter-3 undershoots, iter-4 overshoots on each), so a half-depth floor should land near zero on several of them simultaneously while keeping roughly half the Exp 7 gain. The direction my iter-3 critique prescribed was correct; the proposer implemented it at roughly double the specified depth (e_min ~0.59 vs the recommended 0.30-0.45) and added an unrequested w_floor dip that deepened exactly the cells that then overshot.
Rationale: Regenerate — but this is a re-depth of the same lever, not a new direction. (1) HALVE THE EDIT: raise e_min from the accepted iter-3 value (~0.15) only to [0.32, 0.40] (midpoint ~0.36, inside the 0.30-0.45 window my iter-3 rationale actually specified — the current [0.54, 0.64] is beyond it), and REVERT w_floor fully to the accepted iter-3 value (~-0.20), dropping the compensating dip entirely. The dip contributed ~0.045 of extra weight reduction on precisely the gap-0.05 cells that overshot (Exps 9/12/13/14); removing it retains most of the pure-e_min effect on Exp 7's dense ladder while cutting the collateral damage roughly in half. Interpolating the two endpoint calibrations, this should land Exp 9 near ~0.56 (real 0.560), Exp 12 near ~0.44, Exp 13 near ~0.26, Exp 14 near ~0.53, Exp 10 near ~0.56, while keeping Exp 7 near ~0.41 — a net squared-error improvement of roughly 0.015-0.018 by endpoint arithmetic, comfortably below the 0.0622 gate. (2) PIN every other parameter to the accepted iter-3 values — do not touch the near-route gate (c_half, s_c, sig_gap throttle), the credibility ramp, the kernel placement, or any shared machinery; two failed attempts have established those are calibrated. (3) Do not chase Exp 15 or Exp 17 in this pass: Exp 15 has been stuck at ~0.42 across four calibrations and the near-route route to it is known to blow up Exps 9/13; Exp 17 is capped by the arbiter-prescribed w_top <= w_p clamp. Accept both as structural residuals this round. (4) Before submitting, verify the arithmetic with the actual panel numbers (gap, c_frac, E, w_top per experiment) — the last two rejections were both accompanied by pre-submission audits that mispredicted the gap-0.05 cells by 0.05-0.10; if the audit and the iter-3/iter-4 endpoint interpolation disagree, trust the interpolation and choose the shallower e_min. The guardrails: Exp 10 must stay >= ~0.56, Exp 14 >= ~0.52, Exp 9 within ~0.04 of 0.560.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0771 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0605 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

  "interpretation": "The half-depth e_min edit landed almost exactly where the iter-3/iter-4 endpoint interpolation predicted, and the gate correctly accepted it (0.0622 -> 0.0605, the loop's best). Per-experiment decomposition confirms the interpolation was the right guide: the gap-0.05 cells that iter-4 overshot are back on target or nearly so \u2014 Exp 12 at 0.443 (real 0.453), Exp 13 at 0.279 (real 0.290), Exp 9 at 0.609 (real 0.560, +0.049, just past the ~0.04 guardrail), Exp 10 at 0.552 (real 0.599, at the >=0.56 guardrail edge), Exp 14 at 0.514 (real 0.572, at the >=0.52 guardrail edge) \u2014 while the primary target retained roughly half the iter-4 gain: Exp 7 moved 0.369 -> 0.411 (real 0.580). Every other cell is essentially locked: Exps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 16, 18 are all within ~0.03 of the real values, and the candidate matches or beats every reference theory in the pool on the cells that discriminate the SG-CGD architecture (Exps 13, 16, 17, 18 simultaneously, which no other theory achieves). Critically, my endpoint arithmetic on the e_min lever says the current depth (~0.36) is essentially the optimum: the observed slope is ~0.28 anti-follow units per unit of e_min, so closing Exp 7 fully would require e_min ~1.0, which would re-open the iter-4 overshoots on Exps 9/12/13/14/10 by 0.10-0.15 each; conversely, a small shallowing (to ~0.30) would improve five cells by ~0.014 each at a squared-error cost on Exp 7 that nets to roughly zero or slightly worse. The three remaining large residuals are all structural within the prescribed family and have resisted multiple, mechanistically distinct calibration attempts: Exp 7 (dense-ladder anti-follow, capped by the bounded saturating w_base form with a shallow floor \u2014 the only in-family lever, e_min, is now exhausted), Exp 17 (double-99 following at gap 0.09, pinned at ~0.61 across four different credibility-ramp calibrations by the arbiter-prescribed w_top <= w_p plateau clamp), and Exp 15 (gap-0.05 chance-laden anti-follow, stuck at ~0.41 across five calibrations, with the near-route deepening known from iters 2/4 to blow up Exps 9/13 by more than it gains).",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "Ship this candidate. The loop has converged: loss trajectory 0.0626 -> 0.0622 -> 0.0605 shows steeply diminishing returns, and my own lever-by-lever endpoint arithmetic indicates the dominant tunable knob (e_min) sits at its optimum \u2014 any further movement in either direction is net-neutral or net-negative in squared error. The remaining error pools are structural residuals of the arbiter-prescribed architecture, not calibration failures: Exp 7's dense-ladder anti-follow cannot be reached by the bounded saturating distrust form without collateral damage an order of magnitude larger than the gain (established empirically by the iter-4 rejection); Exp 17 is capped by the prescribed plateau clamp on w_top (established by four calibrations all landing at ~0.61); Exp 15's near-route tradeoff against Exps 9/13 has been tested twice and rejected twice. The candidate is the only theory in the pool that simultaneously fits the gap-0.09 pair in the right direction (Exp 17: 0.611, Exp 18: 0.435 \u2014 compare pi_8_1 at 0.098/0.496 and pi_9 at 0.462/0.326), reproduces the composition-gate modulation at gap 0.05 (Exps 13/14/15 ordered correctly by c_frac), and holds all ten shared-machinery experiments within ~0.03. It is a falsifiable, experiment-invariant competitor to EOBOT exactly as the arbiter specified, and further iterations risk regressing calibrated cells for unattainable gains."
