# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_9`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_10`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_9`).

Replace pi_9 with a new theory: CORC (Composition-Relative Outlier Credibility). Keep the empirically well-validated shared skeleton exactly as in both current theories — sign votes (+1/-1/0) per binary expert, tilted trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] with ceiling just above 0.98, consensus-gated chance flank with partial-ceiling promotion kappa_gate*w_p, low-gain softmax and uniform lapse (these fit Experiments 3-7, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18 within noise). Replace the entire outlier-distrust architecture with a single composition-relative credibility assignment: for an above-ceiling claim (v_top > v_hi), w_top = w_p - D*(1 - Q(c_frac))*S(gap) + G*Q(c_frac)*R(gap), where Q(c_frac) is an increasing logistic in the panel's chance fraction with threshold c_half ~ 0.58-0.62 (chance-dominated panels restore the outlier toward, and slightly above, plateau trust), S(gap) is a shallow increasing separation term, D is a bounded discount (~0.5-1.1 trusted-cue units) applied only when a trusted corroboration core exists (low c_frac), R(gap) is an increasing separation ramp so that a far-floating 99% expert on a chance-laden panel is the MOST credible voice (w_top up to ~1.1*w_p), and G is the restoration gain (~0.3-0.8). Critically: NO far-fraud route and NO mid-gap distrust peak — Experiment 2 (follow 0.637 at gap 0.19) falsifies fraud-flagging, and Experiments 1/19 (follow 0.61-0.72 at gap 0.09, high c_frac) falsify a gap-0.09 distrust maximum. The theory's key contrast with both predecessors: outlier weight is monotone in panel unreliability rather than non-monotone in gap, so it predicts following on Experiments 1, 2, 19 (high c_frac), anti-following on Experiments 8, 15, 9 (trusted core / moderate c_frac, discount D active), and near-chance on dense-ladder panels like 17 and 20 (discount and small credibility nearly cancel). Tied-at-max experts share w_top; a small bounded extremity term may be retained. This makes CORC a direct, stronger competitor to pi_10 on exactly the cells where pi_10's far-fraud amplitude fails, while inheriting the machinery on which both theories already agree.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.748)

**Description**
Edge-Only Bounded Outlier Tallying (EOBOT), gate-widening calibration edition. Subjects integrate every binary expert rating as a sign vote (+1/-1/0) into a zero-sum evidence score with subjective weights computed RELATIVE to the panel: (i) a trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] (ceiling just above 0.98) with a shallow within-plateau tilt; (ii) a small negative chance flank at v near 0.5, consensus-gated with a PARTIAL promotion cap kappa_gate*w_p when an above-ceiling claim destabilizes the scale; (iii) outlier distrust is a BOUNDED, SATURATING shrinkage toward a floor driven by the outlier's uncorroborated EDGE over the next rung — a peaked kernel RELOCATED to gap ~0.088 (so dense ladders and gap-0.05 singleton outliers on trusted panels are taken near face value, while gap-0.09 outliers are deeply distrusted), sitting on a uniform-skepticism floor e_min; (iv) the panel's chance-fraction AMPLIFIES distrust through two split, independently gated kernels: comp_near (its own narrow kernel centered at gap ~0.036, so majority/partial-chance panels deepen distrust only in the small-gap regime) and comp_far (a sharp logistic at gap ~0.18, so a far outlier floating over a chance-laden panel is treated as rigged while a gap-0.14 outlier is followed at face value). This round is a pure calibration claim on the loop-validated structure: the composition gate threshold c_half is LOWERED to [0.34, 0.38] so partially-chance-laden gap-0.05 singleton-99 panels (Exp 12, c_frac ~0.375) actually enter the composition regime (with c_near trimmed to hold the already-perfect double-99 cell, Exp 13, as its gate widens), kappa_lo is interpolated to its empirically bracketed midpoint for the chance-flank sensitivity cell (Exp 5), and e_min is nudged upward for the dense-ladder cell (Exp 9). Choice is a low-gain softmax plus a uniform lapse.

    # Edge-Only Bounded Outlier Tallying (EOBOT), gate-widening edition.
    # Stimulus: array of shape (2, n_features); row 0 = option A,

    # Each feature j casts a sign vote sign(a_j - b_j), weighted by a
    # subjective trust function of the expert's STATED validity v,
    # evaluated RELATIVE to the panel:
    #   (i) TRUST PLATEAU with shallow tilt: all v in [v_lo, v_hi]
    #       (v_hi just above 0.98, so a 98% expert stays INSIDE the
    #       plateau) get approximately equal weight w_p, with a
    #       within-band tilt so higher-validity cues slightly
    #       outrank lower ones.
    #  (ii) CHANCE FLANK + CONSENSUS GATE: v near 0.5 gets a small
    #       negative weight (-kappa_lo at v=0.5, rising linearly to
    #       the tilted plateau at v_lo). When an above-ceiling claim
    #       is present the flank is gated and chance cues are
    #       PROMOTED to a partial ceiling kappa_gate*w_p (counted,
    #       but weaker than genuine mid-band experts).
    # (iii) EDGE-ONLY BOUNDED OUTLIER DISTRUST, RELOCATED PEAK: the

    #         comp_far  = c_far * sig_gap * far(gap) * comp_gate

    #       fraud signal).
    # A small bounded extremity term d_w*(v_top - v_hi)/(1 - v_hi)
    # is retained. All experts tied at the panel maximum share

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.706)

**Description**
Bounded Outlier-Distrust Tallying (BODT). Subjects integrate all binary expert ratings as sign votes (+1/-1/0) into a zero-sum evidence score, with subjective weights computed RELATIVE to the panel rather than as a monotone function of stated validity: (i) a trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] (ceiling just above 0.98) gives all mid-band and 98% experts approximately equal weight; (ii) a small negative chance flank at v near 0.5, consensus-gated so chance cues are counted rather than inverted when an above-ceiling outlier destabilizes the scale; (iii) distrust of an above-ceiling outlier is a BOUNDED, SATURATING shrinkage of its weight toward a floor, peaked in the outlier's uncorroborated edge over the next rung (maximal near gap ~0.05: spurious precision; small but nonzero on dense ladders; receding for large edges on coherent panels); (iv) strongly negative distrust reserved for the composition-amplified regime — an outlier floating above a majority-chance panel. Choice is a low-gain softmax plus a uniform lapse. This round is a pure calibration claim: the only two levers whose slopes have been verified against reliably-signed residuals across the loop (the composition-route amplitude c_amp on Exp6, and the chance-flank magnitude kappa_lo on Exp5) are moved to their anti-oscillation midpoints; every structural parameter is held at its accepted value.

    # Bounded Outlier-Distrust Tallying (BODT), engaged-shoulder edition.
    # Stimulus: array of shape (2, n_features); row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B; entries are binary expert ratings (0/1).
    # Each feature j casts a sign vote sign(a_j - b_j), weighted by a
    # subjective trust function of the expert's STATED validity v,
    # evaluated RELATIVE to the panel:
    #   (i) TRUST PLATEAU: all v in [v_lo, v_hi] (v_hi just above
    #       0.98, so a 98% expert stays INSIDE the plateau) get
    #       approximately equal positive weight w_p.
    #  (ii) CHANCE FLANK + CONSENSUS GATE: v near 0.5 gets a small
    #       negative weight (-kappa_lo at v=0.5, rising linearly to
    #       the plateau at v_lo). When an above-ceiling claim is
    #       present, the flank is gated: gate = lambda_ext +
    #       (1-lambda_ext)*sig_gap, so chance cues are COUNTED
    #       (weight -> w_p) rather than inverted.
    # (iii) BOUNDED OUTLIER DISTRUST (the core BODT claim): the
    #       discount of the panel-max expert is a SATURATING
    #       SHRINKAGE toward a floor, not an unbounded sign flip:
    #         w_top_mod = w_floor + (w_p - w_floor) * exp(-rho_m * P)

    #       widened left width s_l; receding for large edges on
    #       coherent panels via the right width s_r, WIDENED so
    #       the shoulder covers the moderate-gap regime gap ~ 0.09).
    #       Because of the exponential saturation, w_top_mod never

### `pi_10` (overall score: 0.690)

**Description**
SG-CGD (Small-Gap Composition-Gated Outlier Distrust), half-depth uniform-skepticism edition. Subjects integrate every binary expert rating as a sign vote into a zero-sum evidence score with subjective weights computed relative to the panel: a tilted trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] (ceiling just above 0.98), a consensus-gated chance flank with partial-ceiling promotion, and an outlier branch for above-ceiling claims consisting of (a) a bounded, saturating base distrust peaked at gap ~0.088 sitting on a uniform-skepticism floor, (b) a near-kernel composition amplification (narrow Gaussian at gap ~0.035, chance-fraction gate, sig_gap-throttled) that deepens distrust only of small-edge outliers on chance-laden scales, (c) a far-fraud route at gap ~0.185, and (d) a composition-gated edge-credibility ramp that promotes a well-separated 99% expert back toward plateau trust when the surrounding scale is unreliable. The single theoretical claim updated this round: the uniform-skepticism floor e_min — the residual distrust applied to a panel-max expert even when the gap kernel is silent (dense ladders, gap ~0.05 cells) — sits at a MODERATE depth (~0.36), roughly halfway between the near-zero floor of the accepted calibration and the deep floor of the rejected overshoot. This floor is what generates the empirically required mild anti-follow of 99% experts on dense validity ladders (Exp 7) without unbounded sign flips. Choice is a low-gain softmax plus uniform lapse.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # SG-CGD: Small-Gap Composition-Gated Outlier Distrust with a
    # composition-gated edge-credibility ramp, half-depth-floor edition.
    # Stimulus: array of shape (2, n_features); row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B; entries are binary expert ratings (0/1).
    # Each feature j casts a sign vote sign(a_j - b_j), weighted by a
    # subjective trust function of the expert's STATED validity v,
    # evaluated RELATIVE to the panel:
    #   (i) TRUST PLATEAU with shallow tilt: all v in [v_lo, v_hi]
    #       (v_hi just above 0.98, so a 98% expert stays INSIDE the
    #       plateau) get approximately equal weight w_p, with a
    #       within-band tilt so higher-validity cues slightly
    #       outrank lower ones.
    #  (ii) CHANCE FLANK + CONSENSUS GATE: v near 0.5 gets a small
    #       negative weight (-kappa_lo at v=0.5, rising linearly to
    #       the tilted plateau at v_lo). When an above-ceiling claim
    #       is present the flank is gated and chance cues are
    #       PROMOTED to a partial ceiling kappa_gate*w_p.
    # (iii) BOUNDED BASE DISTRUST of the panel-max expert: a
    #       saturating shrinkage toward a SHALLOW floor,
    #         w_base = w_floor + (w_p - w_floor)*exp(-rho_e*E)
    #       with E = max(peaked gap kernel, e_min); the kernel peaks
    #       at gap ~0.088 (steep left wall s_l, wide right shoulder
    #       s_r). The UNIFORM-SKEPTICISM FLOOR e_min is the single
    #       lever moved this round: raised from ~0.15 to ~0.36
    #       (half the rejected overshoot depth), so dense-ladder
    #       and gap-0.05 outliers carry a moderate residual
    #       distrust even where the gap kernel is silent.
    #  (iv) NEAR-KERNEL COMPOSITION AMPLIFICATION (small-gap gate):
    #         comp_near = c_near * sig_gap * L(gap) * G(c_frac)
    #       L is a NARROW Gaussian centered g_near ~ 0.035 (inert for
    #       gap >= 0.07); G is a chance-fraction logistic. The
    #       sig_gap factor is ESSENTIAL and retained: it throttles
    #       the route on dense ladders (gap ~ 0.01), which protects
    #       the cliff-conflict cells from spurious anti-votes.
    #  (v) FAR-FRAUD ROUTE: comp_far = c_far * sig_gap * F(gap) *
    #       G_far(c_frac), F a SHARP logistic at g_far ~ 0.185 with
    #       its own chance gate: closed on every gap 0.09-0.14 panel
    #       tested here, open for far outliers over chance-laden
    #       panels (gap >= ~0.18).
    # (vi) COMPOSITION-GATED EDGE-CREDIBILITY RAMP: for gap >= ~0.075,
    #       cred = c_cred * R(gap) * Q(c_frac), capped at the plateau
    #       value. On a chance-laden panel a well-separated 99%
    #       expert is the only credible voice and is promoted back
    #       toward plateau trust; on a coherent-ladder panel the ramp
    #       stays closed and residual kernel distrust persists.
    # Choice is a low-gain softmax (inverse temperature beta) over
    # the two mirrored scores, plus a uniform lapse (epsilon).

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1031 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1031 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

    Super-expert deference rate.

    Among all trials on which the highest-validity expert (feature 0, the

    fraction of choices that FOLLOW that expert's recommendation (i.e.
    chose the option the 99% expert rated 1).

    FDEI (flattened-diagnosticity integration) gives the 0.99 expert its
    largest positive weight, so it predicts deference well above chance
    (~0.57 overall, ~0.69 on isolated super-expert trials, but BELOW 0.5
    when a 0.94+0.65+0.50 coalition opposes it).

    CREDT, on this panel (0.99 sitting 0.05 above the 0.94 rung with a
    partially chance-laden scale), assigns the panel-max expert a large
    NEGATIVE weight, so it predicts systematic ANTI-deference (~0.21).

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """
    Global outlier-endorsement follow index, side-balanced.

    Uses every trial on which the 0.99-validity outlier expert (feature
    index 0 in this design) actually discriminates the two options (his
    rating is 1 for exactly one of A/B). On those trials we ask: did the
    subject choose the side the outlier endorsed? The index averages the
    follow rate over outlier-endorses-A trials and outlier-endorses-B
    trials separately, so pure display/side bias cancels.

    These are trials 1-8 and 20-24 of the design (R0-R5, R3m, R5m, V1,
    V2, V1m, K1, K2), 13 trial types x 3 reps = 39 trials per subject.

    BODT (deep, composition-amplified outlier distrust: w(0.99) ~ -1.8
    to -3.5 in chance-cue units) predicts subjects systematically REJECT
    the outlier-endorsed side: index ~ 0.32 (centers .20/.24/.29/.34/.39/
    .45 on R0-R5, .34/.46 on the mirrors, ~.21 on the V cells, .42/.36 on
    K1/K2). CREDT (shallow distrust: w(0.99) ~ -0.7 to -1.3, coin-flippers
    near-exchangeable with experts) predicts the outlier's endorsement
    still carries the day on balance: index ~ 0.51 (R-ladder crosses 0.5
    at k~2). The two predicted values are separated by ~0.19 in mean
    against a per-subject SD of ~0.09-0.11 (binomial noise over 39 trials
    plus parameter heterogeneity), giving Welch t of order 6-8 at N=25.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # Double-99 endorsement-following rate on the disputed panel configuration.
    #
    # The design's single structural disagreement is the weight assigned to
    # the 0.99 experts on a majority-chance panel with a 0.09 edge over the
    # 0.90 rung: EOBOT's relocated bounded kernel yields only a MILD anti-vote
    # (w(0.99) ~ -0.28, about half a chance cue against), while BODT's open
    # far-fraud composition route yields a deep anti-vote (w(0.99) ~ -1.9,
    # about three chance cues against). The cleanest behavioral readout of
    # that single lever is: on trials where ONE option wins BOTH 0.99 experts
    # (features 0 and 1) and the other wins neither, how often does the
    # subject follow the double-99 endorsement?
    #
    # These are exactly trials 1, 2 (M1), 11, 12 (V3), 19-23 (D-family),
    # 24, 25 (K1) -- 11 unique trials x 3 reps = 33 observations per subject.
    # Predicted values: EOBOT ~ 0.45 (masked cells near-tie, D-ladder
    # followed, unanimous panel near chance), BODT ~ 0.10 (strong anti-
    # following everywhere). The w(0.99) boxes are disjoint by >= 0.8 weight
    # units, so no parameter setting in either box can close the gap, while
    # every shared parameter (w_p, w_ch, beta, epsilon) enters both theories
    # identically and thus largely cancels in the contrast.

**Metric**
```python

    # Fraction of choices that FOLLOW the 99%-validity expert's endorsement,
    # computed only on trials where that expert discriminates between A and B.
    #
    # The 0.99 expert is feature index 0 (validities = [0.99, 0.80, 0.75, 0.5 x 8],
    # displayed first). On trials 1-24 of this design the 0.99 expert's rating
    # differs between A and B; on trials 25-32 it is tied and carries no vote.
    #
    # The two theories make sharply disjoint predictions for this quantity:
    #  - SG-CGD: w(0.99) in [-14.1, -5.8] on this panel, so the far-fraud route
    #    swamps every other contribution; the 99-endorsed side loses on every
    #    discriminating trial and the follow rate sits at the lapse floor
    #    (~0.02-0.03) for ANY admissible parameter setting.
    #  - EOBOT: w(0.99) in [-2.92, -0.48]; the anti-vote is comparable in size
    #    to a few chance cues, so backing coin-flippers / plateau experts can
    #    override it. Follow rates range from ~0.09 (lone 99 vs 0.80) up to
    #    ~0.75+ (99 + 6-8 coin-flippers vs 0.80), averaging roughly 0.4-0.5
    #    across the 24 discriminating cells.
    # The gap (~0.45) is far larger than the per-subject sampling noise
    # (72 discriminating observations per subject), so the metric is tight
    # within each theory's simulated population.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
CORC (Composition-Relative Outlier Credibility). Subjects integrate every binary expert rating as a sign vote (+1/-1/0) into a zero-sum evidence score with subjective weights computed RELATIVE to the panel. The shared, empirically validated skeleton is retained exactly: (i) a tilted trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] with the ceiling just above 0.98 (a 98% expert stays INSIDE the plateau); (ii) a small negative chance flank at v near 0.5, consensus-gated so that when an above-ceiling claim destabilizes the scale, chance cues are PROMOTED to a partial ceiling kappa_gate*w_p; (iii) a low-gain softmax over the mirrored scores plus a uniform lapse. The entire outlier-distrust architecture of the predecessors is replaced by a SINGLE composition-relative credibility assignment for an above-ceiling claim (v_top > v_hi): w_top = w_p - D*(1 - Q(c_frac))*S(gap) + G*Q(c_frac)*R(gap) - ext, where Q(c_frac) is an increasing logistic in the panel's chance fraction with threshold c_half ~ 0.6, S(gap) is a shallow increasing separation ramp, D a bounded discount applied only when a trusted corroboration core exists (low c_frac), R(gap) an increasing restoration ramp, G the restoration gain, and ext a small bounded extremity term. w_top is capped just above the plateau (~1.1*w_p), so a far-floating 99% expert on a chance-dominated panel becomes the MOST credible voice but only slightly above plateau trust. There is NO far-fraud route and NO mid-gap distrust peak: the outlier's weight is MONOTONE in panel unreliability (chance fraction), not in gap. Tied-at-max experts share w_top. Predicted signature: following of the outlier on majority-chance panels (Experiments 17, 19, 20), mild-to-strong anti-following on trusted-core / moderate-chance panels where the bounded discount D is active (Experiments 6, 7, 12, 13, 18), near-plateau trust on tiny-gap dense ladders (Experiments 9, 10), and no change on the no-outlier panels that the skeleton already fits (Experiments 2-5, 8).

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # CORC: Composition-Relative Outlier Credibility.
    # Stimulus: array of shape (2, n_features); row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B; entries are binary expert ratings (0/1).
    # Each feature j casts a sign vote sign(a_j - b_j), weighted by a
    # subjective trust function of the expert's STATED validity v,
    # evaluated RELATIVE to the panel:
    #   (i) TRUST PLATEAU with shallow tilt: all v in [v_lo, v_hi]
    #       (v_hi just above 0.98, so a 98% expert stays INSIDE the
    #       plateau) get approximately equal weight w_p, with a
    #       within-band tilt so higher-validity cues slightly
    #       outrank lower ones.
    #  (ii) CHANCE FLANK + CONSENSUS GATE: v near 0.5 gets a small
    #       negative weight (-kappa_lo at v=0.5, rising linearly to
    #       the tilted plateau at v_lo). When an above-ceiling claim
    #       is present the flank is gated and chance cues are
    #       PROMOTED to a partial ceiling kappa_gate*w_p.
    # (iii) COMPOSITION-RELATIVE OUTLIER CREDIBILITY (the CORC
    #       claim, replacing every prior outlier-distrust route):

    #         panel's composition credibility: the share of
    #         below-band (chance) experts. On a trusted-corroboration
    #         core (low c_frac) Q ~ 0 and the bounded discount D*S
    #         applies; on a chance-dominated panel (c_frac >~ 0.6)
    #         Q -> 1 and the outlier is RESTORED toward (and with
    #         separation, slightly above) plateau trust.
    #       - S(gap) = logistic((gap - g_s)/s_s): shallow increasing
    #         separation ramp for the discount (near-zero on dense
    #         ladders gap ~ 0.01, saturating by gap ~ 0.09+).
    #       - R(gap) = logistic((gap - g_r)/s_r): increasing
    #         restoration ramp, so a far-floating 99% expert on a

`rationale`: DIAGNOSIS ACCEPTED. pi_9's dominant residuals (Exp 17: 0.46 vs real 0.72; Exp 19: 0.36 vs 0.61; Exp 20: 0.37 vs 0.64; Exp 18: 0.33 vs 0.46; Exp 7: 0.40 vs 0.58) all share one cause: its outlier architecture is discount-ONLY and non-monotone in gap (relocated kernel peak at 0.088 plus split composition kernels plus a far-fraud route), so it can never produce the observed FOLLOWING of a well-separated 99% expert on a majority-chance panel. CORC fixes exactly this with a single monotone rule: the outlier's credibility is increasing in the panel's chance fraction Q(c_frac) (threshold ~0.6), with a bounded discount D*S(gap) when a trusted corroboration core exists and a restoration gain G*Q*R(gap) that promotes a far-floating outlier on a chance-dominated panel up to ~1.1*w_p. The far-fraud route is deleted (Exp 20's 0.64 follow at gap 0.19 falsifies fraud-flagging) and no mid-gap distrust maximum exists (the high-c_frac gap-0.09 panels, Exps 17/19, show following; the low-c_frac gap-0.09 panels show only a mild bounded discount). The empirically validated shared skeleton (sign votes, tilted plateau with ceiling just above 0.98, consensus-gated chance flank with partial-ceiling promotion, low-gain softmax, uniform lapse) is kept byte-for-byte, so the already-excellent fits on the no-outlier and skeleton-driven cells (Exps 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and approximately 1, 11, 14, 15) are inherited rather than re-risked. Expected per-cell movement vs pi_9: large gains on 17, 19, 20 (restored w_top ~ 0.9-1.0 on c_frac 0.69-0.73 panels), moderate gains on 7 and 18 (bounded discount replaces the over-deep 0.088-peaked kernel), small gain on 12; honest, accepted costs on 6 and 13, whose deep anti-following (SSR 0.118; double-99 avoidance 0.29) exceeds what ANY bounded discount can express — these are the price of removing the unbounded fraud route, and they are far smaller than the recovered errors. TWO DELIBERATE CALIBRATION DEVIATIONS from the arbiter's suggested box, both loss-motivated: (a) the discount depth d_disc is set to [1.05, 1.45], slightly above the suggested 0.5-1.1, because the trusted-core anti-follow cells (Exps 6, 7, 12, 13) require ~1.2-1.4 trusted-cue units of discount; the discount remains strictly bounded (w_top >= w_p - d_disc - ext), so no unbounded sign flip is possible and the theory's qualitative claim (monotone in composition, bounded in magnitude) is intact. (b) The discount ramp S is centered in the small-gap region (g_s ~ 0.034) so that dense ladders (gap ~ 0.01, Exps 9/10) retain near-plateau outlier trust (w_top ~ 0.5-0.6, matching the mild anti-99 rates of 0.56/0.60 there), which a later-centered ramp would destroy. The restoration ramp R (center ~0.12) keeps gap-0.05 panels (Exps 12/13) in discount mode while opening fully by gap ~0.19 (Exp 20). This makes CORC a direct competitor to pi_10 on exactly the cells where pi_10's far-fraud amplitude fails (Exp 20: pi_10 predicts 0.02 vs real 0.64), while avoiding pi_9's missing-restoration failures — a strictly stronger position than either predecessor on the composition axis that now carries most of the residual loss.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a clear improvement over pi_9 and was rightly accepted by the gate: the inherited skeleton continues to fit the no-outlier and skeleton-driven cells well (Exps 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16 all within ~0.03), and the CORC restoration branch fixed pi_9's catastrophic misses on Exps 19 (0.358 → 0.756 vs real 0.613) and 20 (0.374 → 0.798 vs real 0.637). However, the residual errors are not noise — they are systematic and concentrated exactly on the cells the CORC claim was built to explain, and they point at a specific miscalibration of the composition gate and the gap basis functions. The failing cells are: Exp 13 (+0.21, worst: 0.495 vs real 0.29), Exp 17 (-0.17: 0.555 vs 0.721), Exp 18 (-0.17: 0.291 vs 0.464), Exp 20 (+0.16: 0.798 vs 0.637), Exp 19 (+0.14: 0.756 vs 0.613), Exp 14 (-0.12: 0.455 vs 0.572, a regression vs pi_9's 0.550), Exp 6 (+0.10: 0.218 vs 0.118), Exp 7 (-0.08: 0.498 vs 0.580). Diagnosis of the mechanism behind these: (a) At Exp 13 (gap 0.05, c_frac 0.556), Q ≈ 0.27 already erodes the bounded discount by ~27%, S(0.05) ≈ 0.67, and the five chance cues promoted to kappa_gate*w_p ≈ 0.6 each swamp the anti-vote — the model lands at w_top ≈ +0.2 where the data (follow 0.29, with 0.94+0.75 rungs and 4-vs-1 chance opposition on the canonical trial) demand w_top ≈ -0.5 to -0.7 per 99 expert. (b) The 17/19 pair is inverted: the model produces 0.555 vs 0.756 while the data show 0.721 vs 0.613 — the composition gate splits these two gap-0.09 panels in the wrong direction (17 gets discounted, 19 gets over-restored). (c) The 19/20 overshoot is compounded by the consensus-gated chance promotion: on Exp 19's panel nine chance cues at ~0.6 units each add ~5+ units to whichever side they favor, pushing following to 0.76-0.80 where real behavior is 0.61-0.64. (d) A structural tension: with S(gap) monotone increasing and nearly flat over [0.05, 0.09] (S ≈ 0.67 vs 0.92), the shared discount depth D cannot simultaneously be deep at gap 0.05 (Exp 13) and shallow at gap 0.09 (Exps 17, 18); the empirical discount surface is non-monotone in gap (deep at 0.05, weak at 0.09-0.14, deep again at 0.24 for Exp 6), which the single increasing ramp cannot express. Note also the rationale's arithmetic on the extremity term is loose (it claims ext ≈ 0.11 but d_w ∈ [0.08, 0.14] with (v_top-v_hi)/(1-v_hi) ≈ 0.46 gives ext ≈ 0.04-0.06), so the per-cell w_top targets were never actually verified.
Rationale: Regenerate, staying strictly inside the CORC family (sign votes, tilted plateau, consensus-gated flank, Q/D/S/R/G composition-relative outlier credibility, low-gain softmax + lapse — all retained). The adjustments should be to the basis functions and gate placement, not the architecture. (1) FIX EXP 13 FIRST (worst residual, +0.21): raise c_half to ~0.65-0.70 so that c_frac ≈ 0.556 no longer erodes the discount (Q should be ≈ 0 there), and re-center/steepen the separation term so it is near-saturated at gap 0.05 (g_s ≈ 0.02, s_s ≈ 0.015); allow d_disc up to ~1.6-1.8. Target w_top ≈ -0.5 to -0.7 at (gap 0.05, c_frac 0.556). (2) RESHAPE S TO BE NON-MONOTONE IN GAP — this is the key structural fix, and it does NOT reintroduce pi_9's falsified machinery: keep NO far-fraud route and NO composition-split kernels, but decompose the discount's separation term into (i) a narrow 'near-rung suspicion' bump centered at gap ≈ 0.04-0.06 that decays by gap ≈ 0.09 (a 0.99 claim floating barely above a 0.94 rung looks like rounding noise — this is what Exp 13 demands and it is NOT falsified by the gap-0.09 following in Exps 1/17/19), plus (ii) the existing slow increasing ramp that saturates only by gap ~0.2 (this carries Exp 6's deep distrust at gap 0.24, c_frac 0.5, where the current candidate is still 0.10 too shallow). This single change resolves the D-conflict between Exps 13/6 (deep) and 17/18 (shallow) that a monotone S cannot. (3) TEMPER THE RESTORATION AND THE CHANCE PROMOTION to cure the 19/20 overshoot: lower G toward 0.3-0.45, cap_frac toward 1.0-1.05, and reduce kappa_gate (or make the promotion per-cue decay with the number of chance cues) so that a nine-cue chance flank does not contribute ~5 units; real following on the most chance-dominated panels is 0.61-0.64, not 0.76-0.80. (4) EXPLICITLY RE-DIAGNOSE PANELS 17 AND 14 before re-fitting: report their exact (gap, c_frac) and the per-cell w_top the metric implies — the 17/19 inversion (real 0.72 vs 0.61 while the model gives 0.55 vs 0.76) must be traced to whether it is a composition-gate placement error (fixable by moving c_half below 17's chance fraction) or a chance-flank context effect (fixable via kappa_gate), since 19's endorsement faces nine promoted chance cues that 17's tie-heavy trials do not. (5) Verify Exps 14 and 7 fall in line once the discount is reshaped (pi_9 fit 14 at 0.550 with a near-rung-sensitive discount; the current flat-S discount over-penalizes it). (6) Recompute the per-cell w_top targets numerically rather than by the rationale's back-of-envelope (the ext miscalculation shows the current box was set on miscomputed quantities). Minor: Exp 2 (+0.06, over-tallying) may improve with a small trim to tilt or beta, but it is low priority. If the next iteration lands even half of these corrections, the aggregate loss should drop well below 0.1031; the loop's gate preserves this accepted base if it does not.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1031 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

Subjects integrate every binary expert rating as a sign vote (+1/-1/0) into a zero-sum evidence score with subjective weights computed relative to the panel.

The outlier branch keeps CORC's single composition-relative credibility assignment (monotone in the panel's chance fraction Q(c_frac), NO far-fraud route, NO composition-split kernels), but the discount's separation basis is now decomposed into two components: (a) a NARROW near-rung suspicion bump centered at gap ~ 0.05 (a 0.99 claim floating barely above a 0.94 rung reads as rounding noise — deeply discounted, but the bump decays by gap ~ 0.09 and is silent on dense ladders), and (b) a SLOW far-separation distrust ramp that only saturates by gap ~ 0.24 (a lone 0.99 floating far above a weak corroboration core on a trusted panel is deeply distrusted). The restoration gain is tempered (cap just at plateau level) and the chance-flank promotion is reduced so that large chance flanks no longer swamp the endorsement signal. Predicted surface: deep discount at (gap 0.05, low-moderate c_frac) and at (gap 0.24, low c_frac); near-plateau trust on dense ladders (gap ~ 0.01) and on gap-0.05 chance-laden panels (high c_frac); capped near-plateau credibility for well-separated outliers on chance-dominated panels, with double-99 endorsements followed more when the opposing rung structure is weaker.",

  "rationale": "DIAGNOSIS ACCEPTED; minimal-diff edit inside the CORC family (sign votes, tilted plateau, consensus-gated flank, Q/D/R/G credibility, softmax + lapse all retained). Three levers changed, exactly per the critic's prescription. (1) NON-MONOTONE SEPARATION BASIS (the key structural fix): the single increasing ramp S is replaced by disc = d_near*S_near + d_far*S_far, where S_near is a NARROW Gaussian bump at gap ~ 0.049 (width ~ 0.016: full at 0.05, ~0.04 at 0.09, ~0.05 at 0.01) and S_far a slow logistic centered ~ 0.15 saturating by 0.24 with its own depth d_far ~ 2.9. Recomputed per-cell w_top targets (with the CORRECTED ext arithmetic: (0.99-0.9815)/0.0185 ~ 0.46, so ext ~ 0.05, not 0.11): Exp 13 (gap 0.05, c_frac 0.556): w_top ~ -0.66 -> follow ~ 0.30 vs real 0.29 (was 0.495); Exp 12 (gap 0.05, c_frac 0.625): the STEEPENED gate (c_half ~ 0.59, s_c ~ 0.022) gives Q ~ 0.83, w_top ~ +0.65, preserving the already-excellent 0.43-vs-0.4525 fit; Exp 6 (gap 0.24, c_frac 0.5): w_top ~ -1.8 -> SSR ~ 0.13 vs real 0.118 (was 0.218); Exp 18 (gap 0.09, c_frac 0.3): discount only ~ 0.6 -> w_top ~ +0.2, follow ~ 0.50 vs real 0.4635 (was 0.291); Exp 14 (dense ladder, gap ~ 0.01): the bump is silent, w_top ~ 0.76 near-plateau, recovering follow toward 0.57 (was 0.455) — the old flat ramp over-discounted dense ladders. (2) 17/19 RE-DIAGNOSIS: both are gap-0.09 panels (17: c_frac 8/11 ~ 0.727, opposing rung a single 0.90; 19: c_frac 9/13 ~ 0.692, opposing rungs 0.90+0.85). The inversion was chance-flank amplification: 19's endorsement rides/faces nine cues promoted to ~0.63 units. With kappa_gate lowered to ~ 0.585 (nine cues now contribute ~4.8, not ~5.7 units) and both panels' w_top capped at ~ 0.88 (cap_frac ~ 0.98, g_rest ~ 0.5), the ordering is carried by the rung structure the endorsement faces: 17's double-99 vs one 0.90 rung -> follow ~ 0.70-0.72; 19's double-99 vs 0.90+0.85 -> ~ 0.60-0.65; Exp 20's LONE 99 at the same cap vs the 0.80+0.75 pair -> moderate ~ 0.62 follow (was 0.798). (3) TEMPERED RESTORATION: cap_frac lowered from ~ 1.1*w_p to ~ 0.98*w_p and g_rest from ~ 0.6 to ~ 0.5, so real following on the most chance-dominated panels lands at 0.61-0.64, not 0.76-0.80. HONEST COSTS, accepted deliberately: Exp 7 (gap 0.09, c_frac ~ 0.5) demands w_top ~ -0.6 while Exp 18 (gap 0.09, c_frac 0.3) demands ~ 0 — a composition-monotone discount cannot satisfy both, so Exp 7 stays ~ 0.08 under anti-followed (smallest of the residuals, and fixing it via a wider bump would break 14/9/10/18); Exp 1 may drift slightly more TTB-ish (its c_frac ~ 0.6 sits mid-gate); Exp 16 lands at w_top ~ -0.1 (small cost ~ 0.03). Every large residual (13: +0.21, 17: -0.17, 18: -0.17, 20: +0.16, 19: +0.14, 14: -0.12, 6: +0.10) is addressed by a mechanism the critic explicitly sanctioned (near-rung bump + far ramp + tempered promotion/cap), while the skeleton-driven cells (2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11) are untouched. Expected aggregate loss well below the 0.1031 floor."
