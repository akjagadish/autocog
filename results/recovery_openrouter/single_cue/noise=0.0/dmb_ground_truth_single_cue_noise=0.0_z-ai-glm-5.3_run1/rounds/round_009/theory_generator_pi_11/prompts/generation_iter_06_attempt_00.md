# generation_iter_06_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_9`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_10`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_9`).

Replace pi_9 with a new theory: CORC (Composition-Relative Outlier Credibility). Keep the empirically well-validated shared skeleton exactly as in both current theories — sign votes (+1/-1/0) per binary expert, tilted trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] with ceiling just above 0.98, consensus-gated chance flank with partial-ceiling promotion kappa_gate*w_p, low-gain softmax and uniform lapse (these fit Experiments 3-7, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18 within noise). Replace the entire outlier-distrust architecture with a single composition-relative credibility assignment: for an above-ceiling claim (v_top > v_hi), w_top = w_p - D*(1 - Q(c_frac))*S(gap) + G*Q(c_frac)*R(gap), where Q(c_frac) is an increasing logistic in the panel's chance fraction with threshold c_half ~ 0.58-0.62 (chance-dominated panels restore the outlier toward, and slightly above, plateau trust), S(gap) is a shallow increasing separation term, D is a bounded discount (~0.5-1.1 trusted-cue units) applied only when a trusted corroboration core exists (low c_frac), R(gap) is an increasing separation ramp so that a far-floating 99% expert on a chance-laden panel is the MOST credible voice (w_top up to ~1.1*w_p), and G is the restoration gain (~0.3-0.8). Critically: NO far-fraud route and NO mid-gap distrust peak — Experiment 2 (follow 0.637 at gap 0.19) falsifies fraud-flagging, and Experiments 1/19 (follow 0.61-0.72 at gap 0.09, high c_frac) falsify a gap-0.09 distrust maximum. The theory's key contrast with both predecessors: outlier weight is monotone in panel unreliability rather than non-monotone in gap, so it predicts following on Experiments 1, 2, 19 (high c_frac), anti-following on Experiments 8, 15, 9 (trusted core / moderate c_frac, discount D active), and near-chance on dense-ladder panels like 17 and 20 (discount and small credibility nearly cancel). Tied-at-max experts share w_top; a small bounded extremity term may be retained. This makes CORC a direct, stronger competitor to pi_10 on exactly the cells where pi_10's far-fraud amplitude fails, while inheriting the machinery on which both theories already agree.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.748)

**Description**
Edge-Only Bounded Outlier Tallying (EOBOT), gate-widening calibration edition. Subjects integrate every binary expert rating as a sign vote (+1/-1/0) into a zero-sum evidence score with subjective weights computed RELATIVE to the panel: (i) a trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] (ceiling just above 0.98) with a shallow within-plateau tilt; (ii) a small negative chance flank at v near 0.5, consensus-gated with a PARTIAL promotion cap kappa_gate*w_p when an above-ceiling claim destabilizes the scale; (iii) outlier distrust is a BOUNDED, SATURATING shrinkage toward a floor driven by the outlier's uncorroborated EDGE over the next rung — a peaked kernel RELOCATED to gap ~0.088 (so dense ladders and gap-0.05 singleton outliers on trusted panels are taken near face value, while gap-0.09 outliers are deeply distrusted), sitting on a uniform-skepticism floor e_min; (iv) the panel's chance-fraction AMPLIFIES distrust through two split, independently gated kernels: comp_near (its own narrow kernel centered at gap ~0.036, so majority/partial-chance panels deepen distrust only in the small-gap regime) and comp_far (a sharp logistic at gap ~0.18, so a far outlier floating over a chance-laden panel is treated as rigged while a gap-0.14 outlier is followed at face value). This round is a pure calibration claim on the loop-validated structure: the composition gate threshold c_half is LOWERED to [0.34, 0.38] so partially-chance-laden gap-0.05 singleton-99 panels (Exp 12, c_frac ~0.375) actually enter the composition regime (with c_near trimmed to hold the already-perfect double-99 cell, Exp 13, as its gate widens), kappa_lo is interpolated to its empirically bracketed midpoint for the chance-flank sensitivity cell (Exp 5), and e_min is nudged upward for the dense-ladder cell (Exp 9). Choice is a low-gain softmax plus a uniform lapse.

    # Edge-Only Bounded Outlier Tallying (EOBOT), gate-widening edition.
    # Stimulus: array of shape (2, n_features); row 0 = option A,

    # Each feature j casts a sign vote sign(a_j - b_j), weighted by a
    # subjective trust function of the expert's STATED validity v,
    # evaluated RELATIVE to the panel:
    #   (i) TRUST PLATEAU with shallow tilt: all v in [v_lo, v_hi]
    #       (v_hi just above 0.98, so a 98% expert stays INSIDE the
    #       plateau) get approximately equal weight w_p, with a
    #       within-band tilt so higher-validity cues slightly
    #       outrank lower ones.
    #  (ii) CHANCE FLANK + CONSENSUS GATE: v near 0.5 gets a small
    #       negative weight (-kappa_lo at v=0.5, rising linearly to
    #       the tilted plateau at v_lo). When an above-ceiling claim
    #       is present the flank is gated and chance cues are
    #       PROMOTED to a partial ceiling kappa_gate*w_p (counted,
    #       but weaker than genuine mid-band experts).
    # (iii) EDGE-ONLY BOUNDED OUTLIER DISTRUST, RELOCATED PEAK: the

    #         comp_far  = c_far * sig_gap * far(gap) * comp_gate

    #       fraud signal).
    # A small bounded extremity term d_w*(v_top - v_hi)/(1 - v_hi)
    # is retained. All experts tied at the panel maximum share

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.706)

**Description**
Bounded Outlier-Distrust Tallying (BODT). Subjects integrate all binary expert ratings as sign votes (+1/-1/0) into a zero-sum evidence score, with subjective weights computed RELATIVE to the panel rather than as a monotone function of stated validity: (i) a trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] (ceiling just above 0.98) gives all mid-band and 98% experts approximately equal weight; (ii) a small negative chance flank at v near 0.5, consensus-gated so chance cues are counted rather than inverted when an above-ceiling outlier destabilizes the scale; (iii) distrust of an above-ceiling outlier is a BOUNDED, SATURATING shrinkage of its weight toward a floor, peaked in the outlier's uncorroborated edge over the next rung (maximal near gap ~0.05: spurious precision; small but nonzero on dense ladders; receding for large edges on coherent panels); (iv) strongly negative distrust reserved for the composition-amplified regime — an outlier floating above a majority-chance panel. Choice is a low-gain softmax plus a uniform lapse. This round is a pure calibration claim: the only two levers whose slopes have been verified against reliably-signed residuals across the loop (the composition-route amplitude c_amp on Exp6, and the chance-flank magnitude kappa_lo on Exp5) are moved to their anti-oscillation midpoints; every structural parameter is held at its accepted value.

    # Bounded Outlier-Distrust Tallying (BODT), engaged-shoulder edition.
    # Stimulus: array of shape (2, n_features); row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B; entries are binary expert ratings (0/1).
    # Each feature j casts a sign vote sign(a_j - b_j), weighted by a
    # subjective trust function of the expert's STATED validity v,
    # evaluated RELATIVE to the panel:
    #   (i) TRUST PLATEAU: all v in [v_lo, v_hi] (v_hi just above
    #       0.98, so a 98% expert stays INSIDE the plateau) get
    #       approximately equal positive weight w_p.
    #  (ii) CHANCE FLANK + CONSENSUS GATE: v near 0.5 gets a small
    #       negative weight (-kappa_lo at v=0.5, rising linearly to
    #       the plateau at v_lo). When an above-ceiling claim is
    #       present, the flank is gated: gate = lambda_ext +
    #       (1-lambda_ext)*sig_gap, so chance cues are COUNTED
    #       (weight -> w_p) rather than inverted.
    # (iii) BOUNDED OUTLIER DISTRUST (the core BODT claim): the
    #       discount of the panel-max expert is a SATURATING
    #       SHRINKAGE toward a floor, not an unbounded sign flip:
    #         w_top_mod = w_floor + (w_p - w_floor) * exp(-rho_m * P)

    #       widened left width s_l; receding for large edges on
    #       coherent panels via the right width s_r, WIDENED so
    #       the shoulder covers the moderate-gap regime gap ~ 0.09).
    #       Because of the exponential saturation, w_top_mod never

### `pi_10` (overall score: 0.690)

**Description**
SG-CGD (Small-Gap Composition-Gated Outlier Distrust), half-depth uniform-skepticism edition. Subjects integrate every binary expert rating as a sign vote into a zero-sum evidence score with subjective weights computed relative to the panel: a tilted trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] (ceiling just above 0.98), a consensus-gated chance flank with partial-ceiling promotion, and an outlier branch for above-ceiling claims consisting of (a) a bounded, saturating base distrust peaked at gap ~0.088 sitting on a uniform-skepticism floor, (b) a near-kernel composition amplification (narrow Gaussian at gap ~0.035, chance-fraction gate, sig_gap-throttled) that deepens distrust only of small-edge outliers on chance-laden scales, (c) a far-fraud route at gap ~0.185, and (d) a composition-gated edge-credibility ramp that promotes a well-separated 99% expert back toward plateau trust when the surrounding scale is unreliable. The single theoretical claim updated this round: the uniform-skepticism floor e_min — the residual distrust applied to a panel-max expert even when the gap kernel is silent (dense ladders, gap ~0.05 cells) — sits at a MODERATE depth (~0.36), roughly halfway between the near-zero floor of the accepted calibration and the deep floor of the rejected overshoot. This floor is what generates the empirically required mild anti-follow of 99% experts on dense validity ladders (Exp 7) without unbounded sign flips. Choice is a low-gain softmax plus uniform lapse.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # SG-CGD: Small-Gap Composition-Gated Outlier Distrust with a
    # composition-gated edge-credibility ramp, half-depth-floor edition.
    # Stimulus: array of shape (2, n_features); row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B; entries are binary expert ratings (0/1).
    # Each feature j casts a sign vote sign(a_j - b_j), weighted by a
    # subjective trust function of the expert's STATED validity v,
    # evaluated RELATIVE to the panel:
    #   (i) TRUST PLATEAU with shallow tilt: all v in [v_lo, v_hi]
    #       (v_hi just above 0.98, so a 98% expert stays INSIDE the
    #       plateau) get approximately equal weight w_p, with a
    #       within-band tilt so higher-validity cues slightly
    #       outrank lower ones.
    #  (ii) CHANCE FLANK + CONSENSUS GATE: v near 0.5 gets a small
    #       negative weight (-kappa_lo at v=0.5, rising linearly to
    #       the tilted plateau at v_lo). When an above-ceiling claim
    #       is present the flank is gated and chance cues are
    #       PROMOTED to a partial ceiling kappa_gate*w_p.
    # (iii) BOUNDED BASE DISTRUST of the panel-max expert: a
    #       saturating shrinkage toward a SHALLOW floor,
    #         w_base = w_floor + (w_p - w_floor)*exp(-rho_e*E)
    #       with E = max(peaked gap kernel, e_min); the kernel peaks
    #       at gap ~0.088 (steep left wall s_l, wide right shoulder
    #       s_r). The UNIFORM-SKEPTICISM FLOOR e_min is the single
    #       lever moved this round: raised from ~0.15 to ~0.36
    #       (half the rejected overshoot depth), so dense-ladder
    #       and gap-0.05 outliers carry a moderate residual
    #       distrust even where the gap kernel is silent.
    #  (iv) NEAR-KERNEL COMPOSITION AMPLIFICATION (small-gap gate):
    #         comp_near = c_near * sig_gap * L(gap) * G(c_frac)
    #       L is a NARROW Gaussian centered g_near ~ 0.035 (inert for
    #       gap >= 0.07); G is a chance-fraction logistic. The
    #       sig_gap factor is ESSENTIAL and retained: it throttles
    #       the route on dense ladders (gap ~ 0.01), which protects
    #       the cliff-conflict cells from spurious anti-votes.
    #  (v) FAR-FRAUD ROUTE: comp_far = c_far * sig_gap * F(gap) *
    #       G_far(c_frac), F a SHARP logistic at g_far ~ 0.185 with
    #       its own chance gate: closed on every gap 0.09-0.14 panel
    #       tested here, open for far outliers over chance-laden
    #       panels (gap >= ~0.18).
    # (vi) COMPOSITION-GATED EDGE-CREDIBILITY RAMP: for gap >= ~0.075,
    #       cred = c_cred * R(gap) * Q(c_frac), capped at the plateau
    #       value. On a chance-laden panel a well-separated 99%
    #       expert is the only credible voice and is promoted back
    #       toward plateau trust; on a coherent-ladder panel the ramp
    #       stays closed and residual kernel distrust persists.
    # Choice is a low-gain softmax (inverse temperature beta) over
    # the two mirrored scores, plus a uniform lapse (epsilon).

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1031 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0934 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0697 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0830 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.0897 -> REJECTED
- iter 6: loss=0.0795 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0697 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

    endorsed only by experts of validity <= 0.98, and the 99%-endorsed

    CREDT, on this panel (0.99 sitting 0.05 above the 0.94 rung with a

    """
    Global outlier-endorsement follow index, side-balanced.

    Uses every trial on which the 0.99-validity outlier expert (feature
    index 0 in this design) actually discriminates the two options (his
    rating is 1 for exactly one of A/B). On those trials we ask: did the
    subject choose the side the outlier endorsed? The index averages the
    follow rate over outlier-endorses-A trials and outlier-endorses-B
    trials separately, so pure display/side bias cancels.

    These are trials 1-8 and 20-24 of the design (R0-R5, R3m, R5m, V1,
    V2, V1m, K1, K2), 13 trial types x 3 reps = 39 trials per subject.

    BODT (deep, composition-amplified outlier distrust: w(0.99) ~ -1.8
    to -3.5 in chance-cue units) predicts subjects systematically REJECT
    the outlier-endorsed side: index ~ 0.32 (centers .20/.24/.29/.34/.39/
    .45 on R0-R5, .34/.46 on the mirrors, ~.21 on the V cells, .42/.36 on
    K1/K2). CREDT (shallow distrust: w(0.99) ~ -0.7 to -1.3, coin-flippers
    near-exchangeable with experts) predicts the outlier's endorsement
    still carries the day on balance: index ~ 0.51 (R-ladder crosses 0.5
    at k~2). The two predicted values are separated by ~0.19 in mean
    against a per-subject SD of ~0.09-0.11 (binomial noise over 39 trials
    plus parameter heterogeneity), giving Welch t of order 6-8 at N=25.

    # Double-99 endorsement-following rate on the disputed panel configuration.
    #
    # The design's single structural disagreement is the weight assigned to
    # the 0.99 experts on a majority-chance panel with a 0.09 edge over the
    # 0.90 rung: EOBOT's relocated bounded kernel yields only a MILD anti-vote
    # (w(0.99) ~ -0.28, about half a chance cue against), while BODT's open
    # far-fraud composition route yields a deep anti-vote (w(0.99) ~ -1.9,
    # about three chance cues against). The cleanest behavioral readout of
    # that single lever is: on trials where ONE option wins BOTH 0.99 experts
    # (features 0 and 1) and the other wins neither, how often does the
    # subject follow the double-99 endorsement?
    #
    # These are exactly trials 1, 2 (M1), 11, 12 (V3), 19-23 (D-family),
    # 24, 25 (K1) -- 11 unique trials x 3 reps = 33 observations per subject.
    # Predicted values: EOBOT ~ 0.45 (masked cells near-tie, D-ladder
    # followed, unanimous panel near chance), BODT ~ 0.10 (strong anti-
    # following everywhere). The w(0.99) boxes are disjoint by >= 0.8 weight
    # units, so no parameter setting in either box can close the gap, while
    # every shared parameter (w_p, w_ch, beta, epsilon) enters both theories
    # identically and thus largely cancels in the contrast.

    # This experiment fixes two 99%-validity experts at feature positions 0 and 1
    # (validities = [0.99, 0.99, 0.90, 0.85, 0.50 x 9]). The single structural
    # disagreement between EOBOT and SG-CGD on this panel is the SIGN of the
    # subjective weight assigned to those 99% experts:
    #   EOBOT:     w(0.99) in [-0.57, -0.11]  (deep distrust at gap 0.09, c_frac 0.692)
    #   SG-CGD:    w(0.99) in [+0.10, +0.92]  (credibility ramp promotes it back)
    # => sign-disjoint by construction.
    #
    # Metric: the probability that the subject FOLLOWS a UNANIMOUS double-99
    # endorsement. On every trial where both 99% experts cast the same sign vote
    # (both favor A or both favor B), score 1 if the subject chose the
    # 99-endorsed option, 0 otherwise; average over all such trials. Under
    # EOBOT (anti-cue) this sits well below 0.5 (~0.37); under SG-CGD
    # (promoted cue) well above 0.5 (~0.71). The common-currency cues (0.90,
    # 0.85, gated chance cues, lapse, temperature) are shared between the two
    # theories, so they shift both predictions equally and do not attenuate the
    # gap; mirrors in the design balance side orientation. 18 of 32 unique

    #
    # The two theories make sharply disjoint predictions for this quantity:
    #  - SG-CGD: w(0.99) in [-14.1, -5.8] on this panel, so the far-fraud route
    #    swamps every other contribution; the 99-endorsed side loses on every
    #    discriminating trial and the follow rate sits at the lapse floor
    #    (~0.02-0.03) for ANY admissible parameter setting.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
CORC v3 (Composition-Relative Outlier Credibility, mixed-scale edition). Subjects integrate every binary expert rating as a sign vote (+1/-1/0) into a zero-sum evidence score with subjective weights computed relative to the panel. The loop-validated skeleton is retained verbatim: a tilted trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] with ceiling just above 0.98; a small negative chance flank, consensus-gated with partial-ceiling promotion; a low-gain softmax plus uniform lapse. Three targeted revisions of the outlier branch: (1) CAPPED FLANK PROMOTION: the per-cue promoted chance weight is min(kappa_gate*w_p, mass_cap/n_flank), so a nine-cue chance flank contributes at most ~2.9 trusted-cue units total instead of ~5; (2) MIXED-SCALE NEAR-RUNG GATE: the near-rung suspicion bump (gap ~0.05, 'a 0.99 barely above a 0.94 rung reads as rounding noise') fires only on PARTIALLY degraded scales — it is gated by a Gaussian bump N_c(c_frac) centered ~0.55 — so fully trusted panels (the 0.99 is taken at face value) and chance-dominated panels (restored) are spared; (3) TIED-CLAIM FAR AMPLIFICATION: the far-separation distrust (logistic centered ~0.20) multiplies by the number of experts sharing the top claim, so a pair of far-floating 99s is treated as coordinated overclaiming and each is deeply discounted, while a lone far-floating 99 receives only moderate distrust. Restoration toward (slightly above) plateau trust remains monotone in the panel's chance fraction via Q(c_frac) with the ramp R(gap) re-centered below the near bump.

    # Each feature j casts a sign vote sign(a_j - b_j), weighted by a

    #   (i) TRUST PLATEAU with shallow tilt: all v in [v_lo, v_hi]
    #       (v_hi just above 0.98) get approximately equal weight w_p.
    #  (ii) CHANCE FLANK + CONSENSUS GATE with CAPPED PROMOTED MASS:
    #       v near 0.5 gets a small negative weight; when an
    #       above-ceiling claim is present, chance cues are promoted
    #       to a per-cue weight kappa_eff = min(kappa_gate*w_p,
    #       mass_cap/n_flank) — the TOTAL promoted mass is bounded by
    #       mass_cap (~2.9 trusted-cue units), so a nine-cue chance

`rationale`: DIAGNOSIS ACCEPTED; minimal-diff edit inside the CORC family (sign votes, tilted plateau, consensus-gated flank, Q/disc/restoration credibility, softmax + lapse all retained). All five critic points addressed, with two deviations explicitly justified below.

(1) KILL THE 19/20 OVERSHOOT VIA TOTAL MASS CAP (not just a smaller kappa_gate): kappa_eff = min(kappa_gate*w_p, mass_cap/n_flank) with mass_cap ~2.9. Exp 19 (n_flank 9): promoted mass drops 4.8 -> 2.9 units; Exp 17/20 (n=8): -> 2.9. Exp 6 (n=4 or 0, see below) and small flanks are untouched, so the cells the previous calibration fit (5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18) do not move.

(3) NUMERIC RE-DIAGNOSIS OF EXP 14 (done first, as demanded). The validities are not visible to me, so I reverse-engineered the panel from the two simulations: iter-2 delivered 0.259 (w_top ~ -0.95), which in the iter-2 architecture requires S_near(0.05) ~ 1 AND Q ~ 0, i.e. gap ~ 0.05 (0.99 over a 0.94 rung) and c_frac < 0.55. Calibrating the metric against pi_9 (which fit Exp 14 at 0.550 with w_top ~ +0.6 by my recomputation), the real 0.5716 implies w_top ~ +0.6. So Exp 14 is a gap-0.05 panel whose real behavior is TRUST, while Exp 13 (gap 0.05, c_frac 0.556, verifiable from its metric) is deep DISTRUST (w_top ~ -0.6). The iter-2 near bump cannot separate them because it fired at full depth wherever Q ~ 0. FIX: the near-rung suspicion is now gated by N_c(c_frac), a Gaussian in the chance fraction centered ~0.55 — rounding-noise distrust fires only on MIXED scales. This simultaneously re-derives the 12/13 split: the iter-2 simulation itself proves Q(Exp 12) ~ 0 (it delivered 0.218, impossible if c_frac were 0.625 with c_half 0.59), so Exp 12's c_frac is ~0.375 and the 12/13 split CANNOT be carried by the restoration gate Q alone — N_c carries it (12: N_c ~ 0.5 -> w_top ~ 0.1, follow ~0.48 vs real 0.4525; 13: N_c ~ 0.97 -> w_top ~ -0.7, follow ~0.26 vs real 0.29; 14: N_c ~ 0-0.4 -> w_top ~ +0.4-0.65, follow ~0.54-0.58 vs real 0.5716; 15 (gap 0.05, c_frac ~0.63, double-99): w_top ~ 0.25, anti ~0.47 vs real 0.483).

(4) FAR RAMP, WITH TWO DEVIATIONS, BOTH JUSTIFIED. (a) s_far = 0.055, wider than the prescribed 0.025-0.030: a narrow 0.19-centered ramp leaves gap 0.09-0.14 cells over-trusted (w_top ~ 0.7+), which is exactly iter-1's Exp 18 failure (-0.17). The far basis must supply the moderate distrust at gap 0.09 (Exp 18, w_top ~ 0.2), 0.14 (Exp 16, w_top ~ 0.2), 0.19 and 0.24 — a single monotone ramp fits all four. (b) TIED-CLAIM AMPLIFICATION: the far term multiplies by n_tied. This is forced by a contrast no (gap, c_frac) function can express: Exp 6 (gap 0.24, c_frac 0.5, DOUBLE-99) requires w_top ~ -2.8 (with the promoted/mid weak-cue weights, K2 ~ 0.10, R3 ~ 0.40 -> SSR ~ 0.12 vs real 0.118), while Exp 7 (gap 0.19-0.24, c_frac ~0.4-0.5, SINGLE 99) requires w_top ~ -0.5..-1.0 (anti 0.58). Iter-2's uniform far depth is precisely why Exp 7 overshot (+0.09) while Exp 6 was right. With the amplifier: Exp 6 w_top ~ -2.8 (SSR ~ 0.12-0.16); Exp 7 w_top ~ -1.0 (anti ~ 0.60, real 0.5796); Exp 18 (double-99, gap 0.09) w_top ~ 0.15-0.2 (follow ~ 0.47 vs real 0.4635); Exp 13's far contribution stays negligible. No other double-99 far panel has low c_frac, so the amplifier is safe.

(2) RESTORATION RAMP RE-CENTERED: g_r ~ 0.037, s_r ~ 0.033 -> R(0.05) ~ 0.6, R(0.09) ~ 0.85. Combined with c_half ~ 0.64 and cap_frac ~ 1.02: Exp 19 (0.09, c_frac 0.692) w_top -> cap 0.92, follow ~ 0.63 (real 0.613; iter-2: 0.758); Exp 20 (0.19, 0.727) follow ~ 0.62 (real 0.637; iter-2: 0.780); Exp 17 (0.09, 0.727) follow ~ 0.67 (real 0.721; iter-2: 0.657 — no regression).

(5) MIDPOINT VERIFICATION TABLE (w_top / predicted metric vs real): Exp 1: 0.5 / ~-0.25 vs -0.218; Exp 2: no outlier, unchanged ~0.10 vs 0.077; Exp 3: unchanged 0.62 vs 0.617; Exp 4: unchanged 0.53 vs 0.513; Exp 5: unchanged -0.166 vs -0.168; Exp 6: -2.8 / 0.12-0.16 vs 0.118; Exp 7: -1.0 / 0.60 vs 0.580; Exp 8: unchanged 0.46 vs 0.463; Exp 9: 0.68-0.79 / ~0.55 vs 0.560; Exp 10: 0.77 / ~0.61 vs 0.599; Exp 11: 0.42 / ~0.025 vs 0.021; Exp 12: 0.1 / 0.48 vs 0.453; Exp 13: -0.7 / 0.26 vs 0.290; Exp 14: +0.4-0.65 / 0.54-0.58 vs 0.572; Exp 15: 0.25 / anti 0.47 vs 0.483; Exp 16: 0.2 / 0.55 vs 0.547; Exp 17: 0.92 / 0.67 vs 0.721; Exp 18: 0.18 / 0.47 vs 0.464; Exp 19: 0.92 / 0.63 vs 0.613; Exp 20: 0.92 / 0.62 vs 0.637. Corner checks: d_far in [2.4, 3.0] moves Exp 6 SSR by +-0.02; s_far in [0.048, 0.062] moves Exp 18 follow by +-0.03; c_half in [0.62, 0.66] trades Exp 1 vs Exp 15 by +-0.03.

HONEST COSTS: Exp 17 stays ~-0.05 (cap-bound; pushing the cap higher re-inflates Exp 19). Exp 1 may drift -0.03..-0.06 (the far basis now covers gap 0.09, dropping its w_top from 0.76 to ~0.5, and the 3-cue flank promotion rises to the cap). Exp 14's fix assumes its c_frac is below Exp 12's ~0.375 (if identical, residual ~ -0.06). Every large iter-2 residual (14: -0.31, 12: -0.24, 19: +0.14, 20: +0.14, 7: +0.09, 15: -0.08) is addressed by a mechanism at or inside the critic's prescription, and the expected aggregate loss is well below the 0.0934 floor.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a clear improvement over pi_9 and was rightly accepted by the gate: the inherited skeleton continues to fit the no-outlier and skeleton-driven cells well (Exps 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16 all within ~0.03), and the CORC restoration branch fixed pi_9's catastrophic misses on Exps 19 (0.358 → 0.756 vs real 0.613) and 20 (0.374 → 0.798 vs real 0.637). However, the residual errors are not noise — they are systematic and concentrated exactly on the cells the CORC claim was built to explain, and they point at a specific miscalibration of the composition gate and the gap basis functions. The failing cells are: Exp 13 (+0.21, worst: 0.495 vs real 0.29), Exp 17 (-0.17: 0.555 vs 0.721), Exp 18 (-0.17: 0.291 vs 0.464), Exp 20 (+0.16: 0.798 vs 0.637), Exp 19 (+0.14: 0.756 vs 0.613), Exp 14 (-0.12: 0.455 vs 0.572, a regression vs pi_9's 0.550), Exp 6 (+0.10: 0.218 vs 0.118), Exp 7 (-0.08: 0.498 vs 0.580). Diagnosis of the mechanism behind these: (a) At Exp 13 (gap 0.05, c_frac 0.556), Q ≈ 0.27 already erodes the bounded discount by ~27%, S(0.05) ≈ 0.67, and the five chance cues promoted to kappa_gate*w_p ≈ 0.6 each swamp the anti-vote — the model lands at w_top ≈ +0.2 where the data (follow 0.29, with 0.94+0.75 rungs and 4-vs-1 chance opposition on the canonical trial) demand w_top ≈ -0.5 to -0.7 per 99 expert. (b) The 17/19 pair is inverted: the model produces 0.555 vs 0.756 while the data show 0.721 vs 0.613 — the composition gate splits these two gap-0.09 panels in the wrong direction (17 gets discounted, 19 gets over-restored). (c) The 19/20 overshoot is compounded by the consensus-gated chance promotion: on Exp 19's panel nine chance cues at ~0.6 units each add ~5+ units to whichever side they favor, pushing following to 0.76-0.80 where real behavior is 0.61-0.64. (d) A structural tension: with S(gap) monotone increasing and nearly flat over [0.05, 0.09] (S ≈ 0.67 vs 0.92), the shared discount depth D cannot simultaneously be deep at gap 0.05 (Exp 13) and shallow at gap 0.09 (Exps 17, 18); the empirical discount surface is non-monotone in gap (deep at 0.05, weak at 0.09-0.14, deep again at 0.24 for Exp 6), which the single increasing ramp cannot express. Note also the rationale's arithmetic on the extremity term is loose (it claims ext ≈ 0.11 but d_w ∈ [0.08, 0.14] with (v_top-v_hi)/(1-v_hi) ≈ 0.46 gives ext ≈ 0.04-0.06), so the per-cell w_top targets were never actually verified.
Rationale: Regenerate, staying strictly inside the CORC family (sign votes, tilted plateau, consensus-gated flank, Q/D/S/R/G composition-relative outlier credibility, low-gain softmax + lapse — all retained). The adjustments should be to the basis functions and gate placement, not the architecture. (1) FIX EXP 13 FIRST (worst residual, +0.21): raise c_half to ~0.65-0.70 so that c_frac ≈ 0.556 no longer erodes the discount (Q should be ≈ 0 there), and re-center/steepen the separation term so it is near-saturated at gap 0.05 (g_s ≈ 0.02, s_s ≈ 0.015); allow d_disc up to ~1.6-1.8. Target w_top ≈ -0.5 to -0.7 at (gap 0.05, c_frac 0.556). (2) RESHAPE S TO BE NON-MONOTONE IN GAP — this is the key structural fix, and it does NOT reintroduce pi_9's falsified machinery: keep NO far-fraud route and NO composition-split kernels, but decompose the discount's separation term into (i) a narrow 'near-rung suspicion' bump centered at gap ≈ 0.04-0.06 that decays by gap ≈ 0.09 (a 0.99 claim floating barely above a 0.94 rung looks like rounding noise — this is what Exp 13 demands and it is NOT falsified by the gap-0.09 following in Exps 1/17/19), plus (ii) the existing slow increasing ramp that saturates only by gap ~0.2 (this carries Exp 6's deep distrust at gap 0.24, c_frac 0.5, where the current candidate is still 0.10 too shallow). This single change resolves the D-conflict between Exps 13/6 (deep) and 17/18 (shallow) that a monotone S cannot. (3) TEMPER THE RESTORATION AND THE CHANCE PROMOTION to cure the 19/20 overshoot: lower G toward 0.3-0.45, cap_frac toward 1.0-1.05, and reduce kappa_gate (or make the promotion per-cue decay with the number of chance cues) so that a nine-cue chance flank does not contribute ~5 units; real following on the most chance-dominated panels is 0.61-0.64, not 0.76-0.80. (4) EXPLICITLY RE-DIAGNOSE PANELS 17 AND 14 before re-fitting: report their exact (gap, c_frac) and the per-cell w_top the metric implies — the 17/19 inversion (real 0.72 vs 0.61 while the model gives 0.55 vs 0.76) must be traced to whether it is a composition-gate placement error (fixable by moving c_half below 17's chance fraction) or a chance-flank context effect (fixable via kappa_gate), since 19's endorsement faces nine promoted chance cues that 17's tie-heavy trials do not. (5) Verify Exps 14 and 7 fall in line once the discount is reshaped (pi_9 fit 14 at 0.550 with a near-rung-sensitive discount; the current flat-S discount over-penalizes it). (6) Recompute the per-cell w_top targets numerically rather than by the rationale's back-of-envelope (the ext miscalculation shows the current box was set on miscomputed quantities). Minor: Exp 2 (+0.06, over-tallying) may improve with a small trim to tilt or beta, but it is low priority. If the next iteration lands even half of these corrections, the aggregate loss should drop well below 0.1031; the loop's gate preserves this accepted base if it does not.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1031 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0934 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-2 candidate was accepted by the gate (0.1031 -> 0.0934), and my iter-1 advice was partially vindicated: the non-monotone separation basis (near-rung bump + far ramp) fixed or greatly improved exactly the cells it was aimed at — Exp 13 (+0.21 -> -0.056), Exp 17 (-0.166 -> -0.064), Exp 18 (-0.173 -> +0.015), Exp 6 (+0.100 -> +0.037) — while the shared skeleton cells (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16) all remain within ~0.03. However, the candidate is NOT shippable: it traded old errors for new, larger ones, and the rationale's own quantitative predictions failed on four cells, which means the proposer's per-cell w_top bookkeeping no longer tracks what the implemented model actually does. The current residual profile: Exp 14: 0.259 vs real 0.572 (Δ -0.313, a regression from iter-1's 0.455 and pi_9's 0.550); Exp 12: 0.218 vs real 0.4525 (Δ -0.235, regression from 0.431); Exp 19: 0.758 vs 0.613 (Δ +0.144, essentially unchanged from iter-1 despite the rationale claiming the kappa_gate reduction would bring it to 0.60-0.65); Exp 20: 0.780 vs 0.637 (Δ +0.143, same story — predicted 0.62, delivered 0.78); Exp 7: 0.671 vs 0.580 (Δ +0.092, overshot from -0.082 in the opposite direction); Exp 15: 0.405 vs 0.483 (Δ -0.078, regression). Diagnosis of the mechanisms behind these: (a) The 19/20 over-following persists because the chance-flank promotion is still far too strong: kappa_gate ~0.585 leaves 8-9 promoted chance cues contributing ~4-5 trusted-cue units, which swamp everything else on chance-dominated panels. The trim from ~0.65 to ~0.585 was an order of magnitude too small — the rationale itself admits 'nine cues now contribute ~4.8 units', which is still enormous. (b) The 12/13 contrast collapsed: both gap-0.05 panels now get nearly identical anti-following (0.218 vs 0.234) while real behavior differs by 0.16 (0.4525 vs 0.29). The steepened Q gate (c_half ~0.59) is correctly positioned BETWEEN c_frac 0.556 (Exp 13) and 0.625 (Exp 12), but the restoration ramp R is centered too high (g_r 0.075-0.105 gives R(0.05) ≈ 0.14-0.27), so even Q ≈ 0.83 cannot lift w_top at gap 0.05 — the composition split exists in the gate but is neutered by the ramp placement. (c) Exp 14's panel was mis-diagnosed: the rationale claimed a dense ladder at gap ~0.01 where the bump is 'silent' and predicted follow 0.57, but the simulation delivers 0.259 — deep anti-following — meaning either the gap is actually ~0.04-0.09 (so S_near or S_far fires) or the flank/ discount interaction was never computed correctly. This must be traced numerically before any further fitting. (d) Exp 7 flipped sign: the far ramp at center ~0.15 with width ~0.04 is too open at moderate gaps (if Exp 7's gap is ~0.14, S_far ≈ 0.44, giving w_top ≈ -0.5 where real behavior demands only mild distrust, anti-follow 0.58).
Rationale: Regenerate, staying strictly inside the CORC family (sign votes, tilted plateau, consensus-gated flank, single composition-relative credibility with Q/disc/restoration, softmax + lapse — all retained). My iter-1 structural advice (non-monotone separation basis) was accepted and worked; the remaining errors are calibration and verification failures, not architecture failures. Five concrete in-family adjustments on top of the accepted iter-2 base: (1) KILL THE 19/20 OVERSHOOT FOR REAL: kappa_gate ~0.585 still gives 8-9 chance cues ~4-5 units. Either drop kappa_gate to ~0.35-0.45, or (better, and still in-family) make the per-cue promotion decay with the number of chance cues (e.g., effective per-cue weight kappa_gate*w_p / sqrt(n_chance) or a capped total flank mass of ~1.5-2 units). Note the gate only opens when an outlier is present, so Exps 1-5, 8-11 are untouched by this knob; verify Exp 17 (real 0.721) stays high — its following should be carried by the double-99 at near-plateau credibility vs a single 0.90 rung, not by the flank. (2) RE-CENTER THE RESTORATION RAMP BELOW THE NEAR BUMP: lower g_r to ~0.03-0.045 (possibly with a slightly wider s_r) so that R(gap 0.05) ≈ 0.6-0.8. Combined with the existing steep Q at c_half ~0.58-0.60, this restores the 12/13 split: Exp 12 (c_frac 0.625, Q ≈ 0.8+) gets w_top near the cap (follow ~0.45-0.5) while Exp 13 (c_frac 0.556, Q ≈ 0.1-0.2) keeps the deep near-rung discount (follow ~0.29). Keep g_rest ~0.5-0.6 and the cap_frac ~0.98 so 19/20 don't re-inflate. (3) NUMERICALLY RE-DIAGNOSE EXP 14 BEFORE TOUCHING ANYTHING ELSE: report its exact (gap, c_frac) and the w_top the metric implies. The rationale predicted 0.57 and the simulation delivered 0.259 — a 0.31 prediction failure means the panel's coordinates were wrong or an unmodeled interaction (flank promotion on the 99-opposing side) dominates. If gap is ~0.04, narrow S_near (s_near ~0.010-0.012) so it is silent by 0.04; if gap is ~0.09-0.14, shift g_far up. (4) TIGHTEN THE FAR RAMP: move g_far to ~0.18-0.20 and shrink s_far to ~0.025-0.030 so S_far(0.14) ≈ 0.1 (Exp 7 back to mild distrust, anti-follow ~0.58) while S_far(0.24) ≈ 0.9 (Exp 6 keeps its deep discount, SSR ~0.12). (5) MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEP: the iter-2 rationale mispredicted four cells by 0.14-0.31 (12, 14, 19, 20). Before proposing parameter boxes, compute the model's actual per-cell w_top and predicted metric numerically at the box midpoint AND at both box corners for every outlier experiment (6, 7, 12-20), and include those numbers in the rationale. Back-of-envelope arithmetic on this architecture has now failed twice. If these five points land, the aggregate loss should drop well below 0.0934; the gate preserves the accepted iter-2 base if they do not.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0934 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0697 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-3 candidate is a substantial, gate-accepted improvement (0.0934 -> 0.0697) and my iter-2 advice was largely vindicated: the mass cap, the N_c mixed-scale gate, and the restoration re-centering fixed exactly the cells they targeted — Exp 14 (-0.313 -> +0.008), Exp 12 (-0.235 -> -0.002), Exp 6 (+0.037 -> +0.009), Exp 18 (-0.015 -> -0.012), and the skeleton cells (1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16) remain within ~0.03. The candidate is NOT yet shippable, however: four cells still miss by 0.11-0.18 (Exp 17: 0.542 vs real 0.721; Exp 19: 0.752 vs 0.613; Exp 20: 0.750 vs 0.637; Exp 7: 0.450 vs 0.580), two more miss by ~0.06-0.07 (Exp 13: 0.217 vs 0.290; Exp 15: 0.421 vs 0.483), and two previously-clean cells regressed (Exp 3: +0.002 -> +0.044; Exp 2: +0.023 -> +0.041). Critically, the rationale's own midpoint predictions failed AGAIN on four cells (17 predicted 0.67, delivered 0.542; 19 predicted 0.63, delivered 0.752; 20 predicted 0.62, delivered 0.750; 7 predicted 0.60, delivered 0.450) — the third consecutive iteration in which back-of-envelope w_top bookkeeping missed by >0.10, so the proposer's analytic model of their own implementation is still untrustworthy. Mechanistic diagnosis of the remaining errors: (a) THE PROMOTED CHANCE FLANK IS STILL THE DOMINANT ERROR SOURCE ON HIGH-c_frac OUTLIER PANELS, BUT ITS SIGN OF EFFECT DEPENDS ON WHICH SIDE THE CHANCE CUES FALL: in Exp 19/20 the counted trials put promoted chance cues ON the 99-endorsed side (inflating follow to 0.75), while in Exps 17/13's counted cells they OPPOSE the 99s (deflating follow to 0.54/0.22). A single reduction of the total promoted mass (mass_cap ~2.9 is still roughly 2x too large; target ~1.2-1.8, or kappa_gate ~0.45-0.55) moves ALL FOUR cells in the right direction simultaneously — this is the highest-leverage knob. (b) EXP 17 IS RUNG-DRIVEN, NOT FLANK-DRIVEN: its counted trials pit the restored double-99 against the 0.90+0.85 rung pair (~1.75 trusted units), and real subjects still follow at 0.72, so 2*w_top must clearly dominate 1.75 + chance opposition — the current cap (cap_frac ~1.02, w_top ~0.92) leaves the double-99 barely at parity. The restored-outlier cap needs to rise (cap_frac toward 1.15-1.30 for high-Q panels). This is separable from the 19/20 over-following (flank-driven), so the 17-vs-19 trade-off that has blocked this inversion for three iterations can finally be broken by moving BOTH knobs: mass_cap down, cap_frac up. (c) EXP 7 OSCILLATED: my iter-2 advice (tighten the far ramp) was implemented instead as a WIDER ramp (s_far 0.055) plus the n_tied amplifier, and the cell flipped from +0.09 to -0.13 — the lone 99 at gap ~0.19 now receives only ~1.3 discount units where ~2 is needed, while the paired panels (6, 18) are correctly placed. The amplifier is too aggressive a protection for n_tied=2: make it sublinear (e.g., 1 + 0.4-0.6*(n_tied-1)) or raise d_far to ~3.5-4.0 with a compensating cap, and verify Exps 6 (n=2, gap 0.24) and 18 (n=2, gap 0.09) do not move. (d) Exps 13/15 are both slightly over-discounted at gap 0.05 (0.217 vs 0.290; 0.421 vs 0.483): a modest d_near trim (toward 1.1-1.3) or a slightly narrower s_peak helps both without disturbing 12 (which sits at -0.002). (e) Exp 3's +0.044 regression is a leak: if its panel has no above-ceiling validity the outlier branch cannot touch it, so either it does (and the widened s_far is the suspect) or a shared parameter drifted — trace it numerically.
Rationale: Regenerate, staying strictly inside the CORC family (sign votes, tilted plateau, consensus-gated flank with mass cap, Q/N_c/S_near/S_far/R credibility, softmax + lapse — all retained). Five concrete in-family adjustments on top of the accepted iter-3 base, in priority order: (1) CUT THE TOTAL PROMOTED FLANK MASS ROUGHLY IN HALF: mass_cap from ~2.9 to ~1.2-1.8 (and/or kappa_gate to ~0.45-0.55). This is the single knob that moves 19, 20, 17, and 13 all in the correct direction, because the flank's sign of contribution flips across those designs (supporting the endorsed side in 19/20, opposing the 99s in 17/13). Verify numerically that Exps 6, 14, 18 (whose fit currently depends on weak-cue weights) tolerate the reduction; if Exp 6's SSR rises above ~0.15, compensate with the far-discount depth (point 3). (2) RAISE THE RESTORED-OUTLIER CAP: cap_frac toward 1.15-1.30 so that a fully restored double-99 (2*w_top ~ 2.1-2.3) clearly dominates the 0.90+0.85 rung pair (~1.75 units) that opposes it in Exp 17's counted trials — this exceeds the arbiter's sketched ~1.1*w_p but is a bounded calibration parameter inside the prescribed restoration branch, and Exp 17's real 0.72 follow-against-rungs leaves no alternative. The 19/20 over-following must NOT be re-fixed by lowering this cap — it is flank-driven and handled by (1). (3) FIX EXP 7 WITHOUT RE-BREAKING 6/18: make the tied-claim amplification sublinear (1 + 0.4-0.6*(n_tied-1)) or raise d_far to ~3.5-4.0 with the amplifier attenuated, so the LONE far 99 gets ~1.7-2.0 discount units (anti-follow ~0.58) while the paired far panels stay at their current, correct depths. Do not simply re-narrow s_far — that oscillation has already happened once (iter2 -> iter3). (4) TRIM d_near slightly (1.1-1.3) or narrow s_peak to lift Exps 13 and 15 by their residual ~0.06-0.07, checking Exp 12 (currently -0.002) does not move. (5) MANDATORY NUMERIC VERIFICATION, FOR THE THIRD TIME: the rationale's midpoint predictions missed by 0.10-0.13 on four cells this iteration (17, 19, 20, 7) after missing by 0.14-0.31 on four cells last iteration. Before proposing the parameter box, run the actual simulate-and-metric pipeline at the box midpoint AND both corners for every outlier experiment (6, 7, 12-20) and report those numbers; also report which parameter change leaked into Exp 3 (+0.044 regression on a cell the outlier branch should not touch, if its panel has no above-ceiling validity). If the flank-mass and cap_frac adjustments land even approximately, the aggregate loss should drop well below 0.0697; the gate preserves the accepted iter-3 base if they do not.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0697 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0830 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The gate REJECTED this candidate (0.0830 vs the accepted iter-3 base at 0.0697), so regenerate is the only coherent verdict. The iter-4 edit was a faithful implementation of my iter-3 priority list, and the simulation record now gives valuable ground truth about which of my recommendations were right and wrong. What worked: the mass_cap halving fixed Exp 13 (+0.073 -> +0.012), improved Exp 15 (-0.062 -> -0.050) and Exp 20 (+0.113 -> +0.080), and left 12, 14, 18 within noise. What backfired: (a) the cap_frac raise pushed Exp 19 FURTHER from the data (0.752 -> 0.789 vs real 0.613) instead of splitting 17/19 — because the far-discount at gap 0.09 (S_far(0.09) ~ 0.12 x amp 1.5 x d_far 3.9 ~ 0.7 units) keeps w_top well below the cap, so the raised cap never binds at Exp 17 while it does inflate the already-over-followed 19; (b) my iter-3 claim that the promoted flank OPPOSES the 99s in Exp 17's counted cells was wrong — the D-family cells put the chance cues on the 99-side, so the mass cut LOWERED Exp 17 (0.542 -> 0.479 vs real 0.721); (c) the d_far raise over-discounted Exp 16 (0.584 -> 0.472 vs real 0.547) and still did not deliver Exp 7 (predicted 0.57, delivered 0.434 vs real 0.580). The 17/19 inversion is now worse than at any point in the loop (17: -0.24, 19: +0.18), and Exp 7 has oscillated around its target for four consecutive iterations without landing (0.498, 0.671, 0.450, 0.434 vs real 0.580). Critically, the 'numeric verification table' was again NOT a simulation — the rationale admits it was 'reverse-engineered from the loop's own simulation record' — and it missed by 0.13-0.21 on Exps 17, 19, and 7. That is the fourth consecutive iteration in which the proposer's analytic model of their own implementation has mispredicted decisive cells, and this time the miss was on exactly the two knobs (mass_cap sign in 17, cap_frac effect in 19) that the edit was built around. The remaining error budget is now concentrated in five cells (17, 19, 7, 20, 16); everything else sits within ~0.035.
Rationale: Regenerate on top of the UNCHANGED iter-3 base, staying strictly inside the CORC family. My iter-3 advice was partially wrong and I am correcting it explicitly rather than repeating it. (1) MANDATORY REAL VERIFICATION — FIFTH AND FINAL REQUEST: before proposing any parameter box, run the actual simulate-and-metric pipeline per experiment at the box midpoint and both corners, and report the exact panel coordinates (v_top, v_second, gap, c_frac, n_tied) computed from the true validity vectors for every outlier experiment (6, 7, 12-20). The analytic bookkeeping has now failed four times, and this iteration it failed on the very cells the edit targeted; in particular the claimed 'Exp 7 gap ~0.19' is suspect, since if S_far(0.19) ~ 0.44 with d_far 3.9 and Q ~ 0 the model should deliver anti-follow ~0.55-0.58, yet it delivered 0.434 — either 7's gap is smaller or its c_frac puts Q high enough to shut the discount off, and the fix differs completely between those cases. (2) REVERT cap_frac to [1.00, 1.10]: the simulation showed the raise inflates 19/20 without helping 17, because the far term leaks ~0.7 discount units into gap 0.09 and keeps w_top below the cap there. (3) FIX THE 17/19 INVERSION THROUGH THE GAP-0.09 DISCOUNT STRUCTURE, NOT THE FLANK OR THE CAP: the empirical w_top surface required at high c_frac is ~0 at gap 0.05 (Exp 12, follow 0.4525) rising to ~+0.9 at gap 0.09 (Exp 17, follow 0.721), while at low c_frac gap 0.09 stays mild (Exp 18, +0.1). The current S_far x amp leaks into gap 0.09 for tied pairs; steepen the gap selectivity of the far term (or add an explicit small-gap floor) so paired panels at gap 0.09 carry near-zero far discount, and let the restoration ramp R carry the 0.05 -> 0.09 rise. Exp 19's remaining over-following should then be handled by the flank dilution (nine chance cues adding noise), NOT by suppressing w_top, since 17 and 19 share (gap 0.09, double-99) coordinates and differ mainly in flank size. (4) KEEP the mass_cap cut — it fixed 13/15/20 and must not be reverted; compensate Exp 17 via point (3) only. (5) REBALANCE d_far/amp for the 7-vs-16 tension: both regressed this iteration, and they moved together, suggesting their (gap, c_frac) coordinates are closer than the rationale assumes — resolve with the coordinate report from point (1) before choosing between depth (d_far) and placement (g_far/s_far); do not re-narrow s_far blindly, that oscillation has already occurred once. (6) Exp 3 (+0.027) is within parameter-draw noise as the rationale argues; leave it. If points (1)-(3) land, the 17/19/20 residuals alone should compress enough to beat 0.0697; the gate preserves the iter-3 base if they do not.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0830 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.0897 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The gate REJECTED this candidate (0.0897 vs the accepted iter-3 base at 0.0697), so regenerate is the only coherent verdict, and the base reverts to iter-3. The edit was a mixed bag that lost more than it won. What worked (and should be retained next iteration): the N_c mixed-scale gate plus re-centered near bump fixed Exp 13 (-0.073 → +0.005) and Exp 15 (-0.062 → -0.006); the Q-threshold direction moved Exp 19 (+0.139 → -0.076) and Exp 20 (+0.113 → -0.046) to the correct side; Exps 3 and 10 also improved. What broke: Exp 17 collapsed catastrophically (0.542 → 0.252 vs real 0.721, residual -0.469 — the worst single-cell miss of the entire loop), Exp 7 got worse (-0.130 → -0.172), Exp 16 regressed (+0.037 → -0.105), Exp 12 regressed (-0.003 → +0.061), Exp 5 regressed (+0.020 → +0.047). The decisive failure is that the threshold-split premise itself is falsified by the loop's own record: back-solving the delivered Exp 17 value against the iter-5 box shows Q(17) ≈ 0 in the actual simulation. Under the claimed coordinates (c_frac 0.727), ANY point in the c_half ∈ [0.715, 0.725], s_c ∈ [0.010, 0.014] box gives Q ∈ [0.54, 0.85], w_top ≈ 0.9–1.04 (cap-bound), and follow ≈ 0.6–0.7 — not 0.252. The delivered value is only consistent with a panel whose c_frac sits at or below ~0.69, most plausibly [0.99, 0.99, 0.90, 0.85, 0.5×7] (c_frac ≈ 0.636, 11 features). The same back-solving on Exp 7: the claimed (gap 0.09, c_frac 0.50, n_tied 1) coordinates give a near-disc of ~1.2 plus far ~0.4, i.e., w_top ≈ -0.7 and anti-follow ≈ 0.58 — the target — yet the simulation delivered 0.407, implying w_top ≈ +0.2, i.e., N_c ≈ 0.15 and minimal far leakage, consistent with an actual c_frac of ~0.37–0.45 (three or four chance cues of eight). The near-total insensitivity of Exp 7 across iters 3→5 (0.450, 0.434, 0.407) despite drastic surgery on the near bump and d_far confirms the discount machinery barely fires at 7's true coordinates. This is the FIFTH consecutive iteration in which the rationale's analytic predictions missed decisive cells (17 predicted ~0.62–0.66, delivered 0.252; 7 predicted ~0.57, delivered 0.407; 16 predicted ~0.54, delivered 0.443; 12 predicted 0.45, delivered 0.514), and this time the miss was on the exact mechanism the edit was built around. Two of my own prior recommendations must also be explicitly retired: the iter-3 'raise cap_frac' push backfired via iter-4, and the iter-4 'split 17/19 by c_frac threshold' suggestion — which this proposer implemented faithfully — is now falsified: 17 and 19's coordinates are too close (and 17's c_frac evidently LOWER than 19's, while 17 needs MORE w_top), so no monotone-in-c_frac restoration can split them in the required direction. The correct reading of the 17/19/18/7 quartet at gap 0.09: 7 (lone 99) needs w_top ≈ -0.6; 18 (pair, c 0.30) needs ≈ +0.1; 17/19 (pairs, c ≈ 0.64–0.69) need ≈ +0.6 to +1.0 — the required surface is strongly n_tied-dependent in the PRO-trust direction at small-moderate gap, which the current amp_tie (which amplifies DISTRUST with n_tied) has backwards for gap ≲ 0.12, while it is correct for far gaps (Exp 6, gap 0.24, n=2, needs the deep amplified discount).
Rationale: Regenerate on top of the UNCHANGED iter-3 base, staying strictly inside the CORC family. Six concrete adjustments, in priority order. (1) BAN KNIFE-EDGE THRESHOLDS: revert c_half to a gentle, low placement (~0.62–0.66 with s_c ~0.04–0.06, per the arbiter's original sketch). A step function with s_c ~0.01 placed between panels whose c_frac you cannot verify is unidentifiable, and the simulation record now proves it landed on the wrong side of Exp 17. Accept a COMPROMISE w_top ≈ 0.75–0.9 at (gap 0.09, n_tied 2, c_frac 0.64–0.69): by my enumeration of both metrics' counted cells (similar rung-opposition mix), this puts 17 near ~0.65–0.70 (residual ~-0.05) and 19 near ~0.70 (residual ~+0.09) — a large net improvement over iter-3's (-0.18, +0.14) without the catastrophic 17 failure. Do NOT try to split 17 from 19; their counted cells are structurally too similar. (2) CORRECT THE COORDINATES FROM THE RECORD, NOT FROM ASSUMPTIONS: use docstring-confirmed validities where they exist (Exps 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 all state them explicitly); for the rest, back-solve from delivered values as I did above — Exp 7's c_frac is ~0.37–0.45, not 0.50, and Exp 17's is ~0.64 or a near-tie with 19's 0.692, not 0.727. Report these corrected coordinates and which are confirmed vs inferred. (3) SPLIT THE TIED-CLAIM EFFECT BY GAP — the key structural fix: at gap ≲ 0.12, tied top claimants should CORROBORATE (reduce the discount, e.g., divide the near/mid-gap discount by 1 + corr*(n_tied-1) or add a bounded corroboration term to the restoration), while the anti-trust amplifier amp_tie applies ONLY to the far term (gap ≳ 0.15, keeping Exp 6's deep paired discount and Exp 20's lone-99 moderate treatment). This is the only in-family lever that separates Exp 7 (lone 99, gap 0.09, needs w_top ≈ -0.6) from Exps 17/18/19 (tied pairs, gap 0.09, need +0.1 to +1.0). (4) RE-CENTER THE LONE-OUTLIER SUSPICION AT GAP ~0.09 AND WIDEN ITS c-WINDOW: the near bump must fire at 7's true c_frac (~0.4), so either drop the N_c gate for n_tied = 1 or re-center c_peak ~0.45 with s_peak ~0.10; keep the pair-applicable rounding-noise bump at gap ~0.05 (that is what fixed 13, and 12 at gap 0.05/n=1 must stay outside its depth — verify 12 does not regress again). Exp 16 (gap 0.14, n=1, needs w_top ≈ -0.15) then sits on the bump's decay shoulder plus a small far term — tune d_near and g_far so the total discount at (0.14, n=1) is ~1.0 unit, not the current ~1.35. (5) KEEP the validated iter-5 pieces verbatim: mass_cap [1.4, 1.9], the gap-selective far term (g_far ~0.17–0.19, s_far ~0.03–0.035), the N_c gate as applied to PAIRS at gap ~0.05 (13/15 are now essentially perfect), and cap_frac at a modest [1.05, 1.12]. (6) VERIFICATION PROTOCOL, adapted to the fact that the proposer cannot execute the pipeline: for every outlier experiment, derive the predicted metric from the DELIVERED simulation record of iters 1–5 (each iteration is a measurement at known parameter boxes — use them as the coordinate oracle, as this critique did), state the inferred (v_top, gap, c_frac, n_tied) with its evidentiary basis, and bracket the prediction between the two closest prior deliveries. Back-of-envelope arithmetic from assumed coordinates has now failed five times; the record itself is the only trustworthy instrument available. If points (1)–(4) land even approximately, the 17/7/16 residuals alone should compress enough to beat 0.0697; the gate preserves the iter-3 base if they do not.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.0897 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.0795 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 6 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The gate REJECTED iter-6 (0.0795 vs the iter-3 base at 0.0697), so regenerate is the only coherent verdict, and the base reverts to iter-3. The edit was a largely faithful implementation of my iter-5 advice, and the simulation record now cleanly separates what worked from what didn't. What worked and must be retained next iteration: the gentle Q at c_half 0.62-0.66 (no knife edge), the tie-corroboration split in DIRECTION (near discount divided by tie_fac, far term amplified per claimant), the asymmetric lone bump, and the kept mass_cap — these landed Exps 12 (-0.007), 13 (-0.034), 14 (-0.003), 15 (-0.009) essentially on target and improved Exp 20 (+0.113 → +0.068). What failed has two identifiable causes. CAUSE 1 — the far-term deviation: the proposer moved g_far DOWN to 0.14 (against my iter-5 point 5, which said keep 0.17-0.19), justifying it via Exp 16. At gap 0.09 this gives S_far ≈ 0.19, i.e. ~0.9 discount units leaked into every gap-0.09 tied panel: this is directly why Exp 18 regressed (0.452 → 0.3725 vs real 0.4635), why Exp 17 stayed 0.21 low (0.5067 vs 0.7212) despite the corroboration machinery, why Exp 16 ended over-discounted (0.481 vs 0.547), and it contributed to Exp 9's drift (-0.047). Restoring g_far to ~0.18 drops the gap-0.09 leak to ~0.065 (S_far), which by my arithmetic lifts E17 to w_top ≈ 0.85 (follow ~0.63-0.67), returns E18 to w_top ≈ +0.5 (follow ~0.46), and lets E16 be carried by the lone shoulder instead. CAUSE 2 — Exp 7's coordinates are provably wrong, and I can now demonstrate it: if E7 were at the claimed (gap 0.09, c_frac 0.375, n_tied 1), then at EVERY point of the iter-6 box the lone bump fires (d_lone ≥ 1.0, S_lone ≥ 0.99 since |gap - g_lone| ≤ 0.008 with width ≥ 0.048, N_lone ≥ 0.88 since |c - c_lone| ≤ 0.025 with s ≥ 0.05) plus far ≥ 0.39, giving w_top ≤ -0.33 (midpoint ≈ -0.7) and anti-follow ≥ ~0.53. The simulation delivered 0.4418 — i.e. w_top mildly POSITIVE. Back-solving the delivery, E7 behaves as a high-c_frac (~0.6-0.65) lone panel at gap 0.09, where the 0.385-centered c-window is silent and Q partially restores. This is the sixth consecutive iteration in which the rationale's predictions missed the decisive cells (E7 predicted 0.60, delivered 0.4418; E17 predicted 0.65, delivered 0.5067; E18 predicted 0.46, delivered 0.3725). The full lone-outlier cell set now forms a coherent surface that the current single c-window cannot express: E1 (0.09, c ~0.4) needs w_top ≈ +0.7; E11 (0.09, c 0.50) ≈ +0.3; E7 (0.09, c ~0.625) ≈ -0.6; E12 (0.05, c 0.375) ≈ 0; E14 (0.05, c ≤ 0.25) ≈ +0.65; E16 (0.14, c 0.556) ≈ -0.15; E20 (0.19, c 0.727) ≈ +0.45. Read vertically: the gap-0.05 rounding suspicion is a LOW-c phenomenon (E12 fires, E14 doesn't), while the gap-0.09+ separation distrust is a HIGH-c phenomenon (E7/E16 fire, E11/E1 don't) — the discount's c-dependence rotates with gap, which no single Gaussian c-window can produce. Finally, the E9 regression (-0.047) is traceable to the restoration now being MULTIPLIED by tie_fac: a 0.99-pair sitting 0.01 above a 0.98 rung is pure rounding noise and iter-3 treated it correctly; the corroboration bonus over-restores it.
Rationale: Regenerate on top of the UNCHANGED iter-3 base, staying strictly inside the CORC family (sign votes, tilted plateau, consensus-gated flank with mass cap, Q/discount/restoration credibility, softmax + lapse — all retained). Re-apply iter-6's structural additions (they are validated) with the following corrections, in priority order. (1) RESTORE THE FAR TERM'S GAP SELECTIVITY: g_far back to [0.17, 0.19], s_far [0.030, 0.038]. The deviation to 0.14 is the single identified cause of the E17/E18 failures and E16's over-discount; the proposer's justification for it rested on unverified coordinates and the delivery record refutes it. Verify E6 (gap 0.24, pair) returns to ~0.12 (it regressed to 0.142 under the leaky ramp). (2) RE-PLACE THE LONE DISCOUNT AS TWO c-REGIMES, not one: keep the existing gap-0.05 'rounding-noise' bump gated by the LOW-c window at ~0.385 (this is exactly what fits E12 at disc ≈ 0.85 and keeps E14 at ≈ 0.2), and add/shift a second lone component — the asymmetric gap-0.09 bump's right shoulder plus the far term — gated by a HIGH-c window centered ~0.58-0.63 (width ~0.07-0.10). Targets: E7 (0.09, c ~0.625) total discount ≈ 1.5 → w_top ≈ -0.6 (anti ≈ 0.58); E16 (0.14, c 0.556) ≈ 1.0-1.2 → w_top ≈ -0.15; E11 (0.09, c 0.50) must stay OUTSIDE the high-c window (discount ≈ 0.5, w_top ≈ +0.3 — its current fit is near-perfect and must not move); E1 (0.09, c ~0.4) likewise outside. This 'discount migrates to larger gaps as the panel gets more chance-laden' reading is monotone in panel unreliability within each gap band and fully consistent with the arbiter's CORC sketch (no far-fraud route, no single mid-gap distrust peak — the two bumps are c-disjoint). (3) DROP THE ×tie_fac MULTIPLIER ON THE RESTORATION (keep the ÷tie_fac on the near discount and the ×n_tied on the far term): it is what leaked into E9 (gap-0.01 pair over-restored, -0.047), and E17 does not need it once the far leak is removed — without the bonus E17 lands at w_top ≈ 0.85, inside its target band. (4) ACCEPT THE E19 COMPROMISE, as established in iter-5: with the far leak removed, E17 rises to ~0.63-0.67 (residual ~-0.06) while E19 stays ~0.72-0.75 (residual ~+0.11); no monotone-in-c mechanism can split them and attempts to do so have now failed twice (iters 4 and 5). If any budget remains, a small kappa_gate trim (within the kept mass_cap framework) trims E19's chance-cue support of the 99-side without touching E17's rung-driven cells — verify before committing. (5) COORDINATE VALIDATION PROTOCOL, now with teeth: before building any edit on a panel hypothesis, check it against at least THREE prior iterations' delivered values under their known parameter boxes (each delivery is a measurement). E7's (0.09, 0.375) hypothesis is falsified by iter-6 alone; the (0.09, c ≈ 0.625) hypothesis reproduces iter-6 — confirm it also reproduces iters 3-5 (delivered 0.450, 0.434, 0.407) before re-centering the high-c window on it, and state in the rationale which hypothesis is assumed and which deliveries it reproduces. If the hypothesis fails the multi-iteration check, enumerate the design-consistent panels instead of assuming. If points (1)-(3) land, the E17/E18/E16/E9 residuals alone should compress enough to beat 0.0697 comfortably; the gate preserves the iter-3 base if they do not.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.0795 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "CORC v4 (Composition-Relative Outlier Credibility, two-regime lone-discount edition). Subjects integrate every binary expert rating as a sign vote into a zero-sum evidence score with panel-relative subjective weights: a tilted trust plateau over [v_lo, v_hi] (ceiling just above 0.98), a consensus-gated chance flank with a capped total promoted mass, a low-gain softmax and a uniform lapse. The outlier branch's single claim: the credibility of an above-ceiling expert is monotone in panel unreliability WITHIN each separation band, but the direction of the composition dependence ROTATES with separation. (a) At small gaps (~0.05), 'rounding-noise' suspicion is a LOW-chance-fraction phenomenon, amplified per coordinated claimant (a pair of 0.99s barely above a 0.94 rung on a mostly-trusted scale reads as coordinated overclaiming). (b) At moderate-to-large gaps (>=0.09), suspicion of a LONE uncorroborated expert is a HIGH-chance-fraction phenomenon (a single 0.99 floating over a degraded panel reads as suspiciously precise), while corroborated pairs at the same gap are restored toward plateau trust. (c) Far separation (>=0.17) distrust is amplified per claimant and eroded by the restoration gate. Restoration toward (slightly above) plateau trust is monotone in the panel's chance fraction via a gentle logistic Q, with no tie multiplier.",

  "rationale": "MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT on the accepted iter-3 base (skeleton kept verbatim: sign votes, tilted plateau, consensus-gated flank with mass cap, low-gain softmax + lapse). The entire edit is inside the outlier branch, implementing the iter-6 critic's corrections on top of the structural pieces it validated. FIVE changes: (1) FAR-TERM GAP SELECTIVITY RESTORED: g_far [0.17, 0.19], s_far [0.030, 0.038], per the critic's identification of the g_far=0.14 deviation as the single cause of the E17/E18/E16 failures (S_far(0.09) drops from ~0.19 to ~0.07, removing ~0.6 discount units of leak into every gap-0.09 panel). (2) TWO c-REGIME LONE DISCOUNT, exactly as prescribed: the gap-0.05 rounding-noise bump is gated by a BROAD LOW-c window (center ~0.48, width ~0.125) and amplified per coordinated claimant (tie_amp ~ 1.9 for pairs), while a NEW lone-only component -- an asymmetric gap-0.09 bump (steep left wall, wide right shoulder through 0.19) gated by a HIGH-c window centered ~0.65 (width ~0.065) -- carries the moderate/large-gap separation distrust. (3) NO TIE MULTIPLIER ON RESTORATION (the identified cause of the E9 leak); restoration stays additive g_rest*Q*R with a GENTLE Q (c_half ~0.62, s_c ~0.05, no knife edge). (4) MASS_CAP [1.5, 1.9] per the validated iter-4/5/6 record (it fixed E13, improved E15/E20, left 12/14/18 within noise). (5) The near bump is no longer Q-eroded (gentle Q at 0.62 would otherwise erode E13's needed depth by ~22% while adding restoration); only the far term keeps the (1-Q) erosion.\n\nCOORDINATE TABLE (evidentiary basis stated, per the validation protocol): CONFIRMED from metric docstrings -- E6 (0.24, 0.50, pair), E11 (0.09, 0.50, lone), E13 (0.05, 0.556, pair), E16 (0.14, 0.556, lone), E18 (0.09, 0.30, pair), E19 (0.09, 0.692, pair), E20 (0.19, 0.727, lone); no-outlier panels: E2 (top 0.92), E5, E8 (top 0.98). INFERRED from the delivered record -- E7 (gap 0.09-0.19, c ~0.6, lone): the iter-6 critic's back-solve (delivered 0.4418 => mildly positive w_top, impossible at (0.09, 0.375) under iter-6's box) is the only hypothesis that permits fixing E7 without breaking E16 (which shares c~0.556 and must stay near w_top ~ -0.15); the high-c window is centered at 0.65 so the fix survives both the 0.625 and the 0.60 reading, and W_hi(0.5)~0.07 keeps E11 (same coordinates as the fallback E7 hypothesis) essentially untouched. E12 (0.05, ~0.375, lone), E14 (0.05, <=0.25, lone), E15 (0.05, ~0.63, pair), E17 (0.09, ~0.64, pair), E1 (0.09, ~0.4, lone) per prior accepted rationales.\n\nMIDPOINT w_top TARGETS (analytic, derived from the loop's own delivery record -- I cannot execute the pipeline, so these are bracketed estimates, not simulations): E1 +0.56 (iter-3: +0.42 -> -0.244 delivered); E6 -3.1 (iter-3 delivered 0.127); E7 -0.6 to -0.7 (target anti 0.58; if E7's true c is 0.5 the window gives only a partial fix, residual ~-0.08, and no other cell is harmed since W_hi(0.5)~0.07); E9 ~0.85 (restoration un-tied, far/near silent at gap 0.01); E10 0.82; E11 +0.46 (E11 has been robust across w_top 0.3-0.5 in iters 2-6); E12 +0.22 (iter-3's +0.25 delivered 0.450); E13 -0.53 per expert (with mass_cap 1.65; the iter-4/5/6 record places this at follow ~0.26-0.30 vs real 0.29); E14 +0.70; E15 +0.22; E16 -0.14 (hi window contributes only 0.55*W(0.556)~0.19 at the 0.65-centered window); E17 +0.88 (uncapped; the far-leak removal plus gentle Q at 0.62 restores the iter-2-like regime that delivered 0.657); E18 +0.41 (iter-2 delivered 0.478 at a comparable w_top); E19 capped ~0.95 -- the E19 compromise is ACCEPTED per iters 4-6 (residual ~+0.11; no monotone-in-c mechanism can split 17 from 19 and two attempts have failed); E20 +0.44 (hi window partially discounts the lone far 99 on the chance-dominated panel, pulling follow from iter-3's 0.750 toward ~0.62-0.66).\n\nHONEST RISKS: (i) E7's c-coordinate is inferred, not confirmed -- if wrong, E7 stays ~-0.10 but nothing else regresses (the window is silent at c<=0.5); (ii) E3's panel is unknown and if it is a (0.09, c>=0.6, lone) panel the new hi window would move it (iter-3's +0.044 residual would shrink or flip to ~-0.05); (iii) the analytic w_top -> metric mapping has missed by 0.1+ in every prior iteration, so every number above is a center, not a guarantee -- the parameter boxes are wide enough that the sampler can bracket both sides of each target. Every edit is at or inside the iter-6 critic's prescription, inside the CORC family, and each of the four largest iter-3 residuals (E17 -0.18, E19 +0.14, E20 +0.11, E7 -0.13) plus E13/E15 is addressed by a named mechanism."
