# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Skeptical (Inverted-Trust) Tallying with a CALIBRATED trust cliff. People integrate ALL binary expert ratings as sign votes (+1/-1/0) into a zero-sum evidence score whose per-cue weight is a non-monotone function of stated validity: (i) near-chance experts (v ~ 0.5) carry a small NEGATIVE weight (their endorsements are treated as mildly anti-diagnostic noise); (ii) trust rises smoothly to a peak at v ~ 0.9 (the most trusted experts); (iii) claimed near-certainty (v > ~0.96) falls past a cliff into a MODERATE negative weight of roughly MINUS ONE trusted-cue unit — a 99% expert is treated as approximately one reliable anti-cue, not a veto. The calibrating claim is that distrust magnitude is matched to trust magnitude (|w(0.99)| ~ w_peak ~ 1, logit contribution 2*beta*w(0.99) ~ -2.1): a single super-expert loses to any 2-cue opposing coalition (weak-side choice in super-expert conflicts) but cannot invert coalitions that include it (moderate tally-following when the 0.99 cue sits inside a tally majority). This intermediate depth sits deliberately between the previously falsified extremes: the deep veto (iter 6, which deterministically inverted Experiment 3) and the shallow discount (iter 7, which let super-experts win conflicts, SSR 0.69).

## THEORY 2 — pi_4
Flattened-Diagnosticity Evidence Integration (the extreme-compression corner of the Bayesian cue-counting family): people integrate ALL binary expert ratings into one evidence score, where each discriminating cue casts a sign vote weighted by w_j = max(log(v_j/(1-v_j)) - tau, 0)^delta — chance cues (v=0.5) are annihilated exactly, but among genuinely diagnostic cues the subjective weight is a HEAVILY flattened (delta ~ 0.15) version of the normative log-odds, and choice is a low-gain softmax (2*beta ~ 0.6) plus a small uniform lapse. The new theoretical claim is that the compression exponent delta is itself the structural margin-compression device: shrinking delta equalizes weights, which GROWS count-dominated conflict margins (where cues split across options) while SHRINKING alignment-dominated cumulative margins (where several strong cues pile onto one side). This differential action — not any global gain knob, and not trial-level normalization — is what lets a single small beta simultaneously produce moderate TTB-leaning conflict-trial behavior (Exp 1), a slightly positive tally-vs-top-cue regression slope (Exp 2), graded ~0.62 tally-following (Exp 3), and near-chance |d|=1 agreement driven by the cancellation between super-expert matches and super-expert reversals (Exp 4).

**Rationale:** CORE LOGIC. Both theories share the identical architecture (sign votes x validity weights x softmax x lapse) and differ ONLY in the weight function's shape across validity. My advocated theory makes three sign-structured claims the competitor cannot mimic: (i) claimed near-certainty is ANTI-diagnostic: w(0.99) is negative (~ -1 trusted-cue unit, box |w(0.99)| in [0.86, 1.24]) while the competitor gives 0.99 its LARGEST positive weight (w in [1.17, 1.38]); (ii) trust peaks at v~0.90 and FALLS by 0.95 (my w(0.95)/w(0.90) ~ 0.5-0.7) while the competitor is monotone (though its delta~0.15 flattening makes 0.95 vs 0.90 nearly a tie, ratio 1.05); (iii) near-chance experts carry a small NEGATIVE weight (w(0.50) = -0.075 to -0.105) while the competitor annihilates v=0.5 EXACTLY (llr=0 for every parameter) and gives v=0.51 up to +0.53 cue units where my theory gives ~0. Validities: [0.99, 0.95, 0.90, 0.80, 0.70, 0.51, 0.50, 0.50] -- one expert in each regime. 19 unique pairs x K = 96//19 = 5 = 95 trials.

FAMILY S/X (super-expert inversion + parameter-free flatness knife). S1 (A wins only the 0.99 expert): my box p(A) in [0.08, 0.20] (center 0.13); competitor box [0.62, 0.73] (center 0.68) -- DISJOINT with a 40-point gap, the flagship cell: I predict subjects choose AGAINST the 99% expert's endorsement, the competitor predicts they follow it. S1m mirrors. X1 (A wins 0.99, B wins one 0.50 cue) and X3 (A wins 0.99 plus one 0.50 cue): the competitor's w(0.50)=0 exactly, so it must predict p(S1) = p(X1) = p(X3) EXACTLY for every (delta, tau, beta, epsilon) -- a parameter-free triple equality. My theory predicts a strict ordering X3 (0.12) < S1 (0.13) < X1 (0.15) at center, with box gaps of 0.05-0.13 per step, because a chance cue won by B is anti-diagnostic evidence FOR A. Observed equality across S1/X1/X3 falsifies my chance-cue anti-weight; any reliable deviation from the triple equality falsifies the competitor outright.

FAMILY P (peak-at-0.90 non-monotonicity). P1 (A wins 0.95, B wins 0.90): my box [0.23, 0.38] (center 0.31 -- the 0.90 expert beats the 0.95 expert); competitor box [0.47, 0.55] (center 0.51 -- its flattened weights make the two nearly exchangeable). Disjoint. P1m mirrors. Note p(P1) > 0.56 would falsify BOTH theories, an honest boundary.

FAMILY D (calibrated cliff depth vs super-expert coalitions). D4 (A wins 0.99+0.90, B wins 0.80): my box [0.10, 0.25] (center 0.17 -- the super-expert's anti-vote nearly cancels the 0.90 endorsement, so a single 0.80 expert wins); competitor box [0.62, 0.87] (center 0.69). Sign-flip cell. D4m mirrors. D1m (A wins 0.90, B wins 0.99): mine [0.93, 0.97] vs competitor [0.42, 0.50] -- the competitor can never exceed chance when a lone 0.99 expert opposes a 0.90 expert, I predict near-certainty. D5 (A wins 0.99+0.90+0.80, B wins 0.70) tests the 'cannot invert coalitions that include it' claim: I follow the 3-vs-1 tally only MODERATELY (center 0.58, box [0.44, 0.71]) while the competitor is confident (center 0.81, box [0.74, 0.94]) -- a confidence dissociation even where choices agree; p(D5) >= 0.85 strains my calibrated cliff depth. D2 (A wins 0.99+0.51, B wins 0.90) vs D1-structure: the competitor predicts D2 > D1 by up to +0.15 (the 0.51 cue is worth up to 0.53 units to it); I predict |D2 - D1| <= 0.02 (w(0.51) ~ 0), and my box on D2 is [0.04, 0.07] vs competitor [0.48, 0.65] -- disjoint.

FAMILY C (chance-cue anti-weight). C2 (A wins both 0.50 cues, nothing else discriminates): the competitor must predict EXACTLY 0.50 (all weights zero -> uniform softmax, lapse uniform) -- parameter-free; I predict 0.42 (box [0.38, 0.43]), i.e., a majority of 50%-accurate endorsements pushes choice BELOW chance. C3 (A wins 0.51+0.50+0.50, a 3-0 cue sweep): my box [0.35, 0.41]; competitor box [0.50, 0.60] -- disjoint, and at center a 20-point sign-direction flip (I choose B despite A winning every discriminating cue). C3m mirrors. Any p > 0.50 on C2/C3 falsifies my anti-diagnostic sign; any reliable p != 0.50 on C2 falsifies the competitor with no free parameters.

FAMILY F/T (delta-flattening vs v_lo annihilation). F1 (A wins 0.80; B wins 0.70+0.51+0.50): the competitor's flattened weights make the 0.51 cue worth over half a 0.80 cue, so its box predicts B (center 0.41, box [0.42, 0.52] for p(A)); my w(0.51)~0 and w(0.50)<0, so I predict A (center 0.64, box [0.57, 0.69]) -- disjoint, center sign flip despite a 1-vs-3 cue count. F1m mirrors. T1 (A wins 0.90; B wins 0.51+0.50+0.50): my box [0.85, 0.92] (the weak stack is anti-diagnostic, amplifying A) vs competitor [0.55, 0.70] -- disjoint; p(T1) < 0.80 is a knife against MY theory's chance-cue distrust magnitude, included deliberately.

ANCHORS. G1/G1m (0.95+0.90+0.80+0.70 vs 0.51+0.50+0.50): both theories choose the trusted stack at high confidence (mine ~0.95, competitor ~0.89), pinning lapse/temperature. PREDICTED PATTERN IF MY THEORY IS RIGHT (center params): S1 .13, X3 .12, S1 .13, X1 .15 (ordered), P1 .31, D4 .17, D1m .93, D5 .58, D2 .04, C2 .42, C3 .38, F1 .64, T1 .88, G1 .95 -- super-expert endorsements followed inverts, chance-cue majorities inverted, 0.90 > 0.95. IF THE COMPETITOR IS RIGHT: S1 = X1 = X3 = .68 exactly, P1 .51, D4 .69, D1m .47, D5 .81, D2 .60, C2 exactly .50, C3 .58, F1 .41, T1 .57, G1 .89 -- super-experts followed, chance cues invisible, near-flat validity gradient. The boxes are disjoint on 11 of 19 cells and every family contains a parameter-free equality or exact-0.50 prediction for the competitor that my theory breaks in a signed, graded, pre-registered direction. Sides are balanced (9 A-tilted / 10 B-tilted under my theory; every family has an A/B mirror); no all-tie trials; every trial requires scanning all 8 experts.

**Computed schedule:** 19 unique pairs × 5 reps = 95 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The single sharpest, most robust knife between the two theories in this design is the sign of the weight on the 99%-validity expert (feature 0). My advocated theory assigns w(0.99) ~ -1 trusted-cue unit (anti-diagnostic endorsement), while the competitor assigns it its largest positive weight (~1.16-1.36 cue units). Feature 0 discriminates on 9 of the 19 unique trial types (trials 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17), i.e. 45 of the 95 trials per subject, so the metric averages over a large, pre-registered, sign-consistent family rather than a single cell.

Predicted values (center parameters, lapse included):
- Advocated theory: per-trial anti-follow rates ~0.87 (S1/S1m, trials 1-2), ~0.85-0.90 (trials 3-4, 7-8), ~0.93 (trial 15, the 0.90-vs-0.99 cell), ~0.96 (trial 17), ~0.42 (trial 16) -> pooled index ~0.84, with per-subject SD ~0.05-0.07 (45 Bernoulli trials plus modest parameter spread; the parameter boxes keep every S1-type anti-follow rate inside [0.79, 0.90]).
- Competing theory: anti-follow ~0.19-0.31 on the S1/D-type cells, ~0.40-0.52 on the near-tie cells -> pooled index ~0.33, per-subject SD ~0.07.

The mean gap (~0.5) is enormous relative to the between-subject spread, so Welch's t-test at N=25 separates the theories by many standard errors (t > 20 expected). The metric is a plain behavioral proportion (no free parameters, no fitting to either model), it is well defined both on the pooled DataFrame and on any single subject's slice (each subject sees all 19 trial types x 5 reps, so ~45 qualifying trials per subject), and it is robust to the exact validities of features 5-7 because it depends only on feature 0, whose validity (0.99) is fixed by the design. Under my theory the index is high (subjects are contrarians toward the near-certain expert); under the competitor it is low (subjects follow the near-certain expert). A value near 0.5 would be evidence against both.

    Advocated theory (inverted trust): the 99% expert's endorsement is

    predominantly choose AGAINST it -> index ~0.8-0.9.

    LARGEST positive weight, so subjects predominantly FOLLOW it ->

**Rationale:** CORE LOGIC. Both theories share the identical architecture (sign votes x validity weights x softmax x lapse) and differ ONLY in the weight function. My advocated theory (FDEI) compresses diagnosticity heavily (delta in [0.1,0.2]), so among genuinely diagnostic cues its weights are nearly FLAT: w(0.98) in [1.14,1.31], w(0.90) in [1.08,1.17], w(0.75) ~ 1.01, w(0.55) in [0.69,0.85]. The competitor (SITT) has a steep inverted-U: w(0.55) ~ 0.18-0.23, w(0.75) ~ 0.68-0.74, w(0.90) ~ 0.95-1.0 (peak), w(0.98) NEGATIVE in [-1.14,-0.70]. The single most informative behavioral quantity is therefore the EXCHANGE RATE between a strong expert and weak (55%) experts, measurable as the crossover point k* in a weak-cue dose-response ladder. Validities: [0.98, 0.90, 0.75, 0.55, 0.55, 0.55, 0.55, 0.55, 0.55] -- one expert per regime plus SIX 55% experts, enough to bracket both theories' crossovers. This is a design no prior experiment used: no v=0.5 annihilation logic ([4]), no tally-margin decorrelation ([1],[2]), no bounded-box ceiling attack ([3]), no validity-ratio ER between diagnosticity classes ([5]), and unlike [6] the flagship is not a standalone 0.99 inversion but graded crossover ladders (the 0.98 cliff cells here appear only inside coalitions).

FAMILY K (flagship crossover ladder). K1-K6: A wins the 90% expert, B wins k of the 55% experts, k=1..6. The crossover k* = w(0.90)/w(0.55) is boxed DISJOINTLY: FDEI k* in [1.27, 1.69] (crosses 0.5 between k=1 and k=2); SITT k* in [4.1, 5.6] (crosses between k=4 and k=5). Every single cell is box-disjoint. FDEI center (delta=0.15, tau=0.01, beta=0.32): p(A) = .55, .43, .32, .22, .15, .10 for k=1..6. SITT center (v_lo=.51, v_peak=.90, v_hi=.96, rho1=.7, rho2=.3, kappa_hi=1.15, beta=1.0, eps=.055): p(A) = .81, .75, .68, .59, .49, .40. Box-level: at k=1, FDEI [.53,.59] vs SITT [.75,.84]; k=2, [.42,.46] vs [.69,.79]; k=3, [.31,.42] vs [.61,.72]; k=4, [.22,.31] vs [.51,.64]; k=5, [.15,.24] vs [.42,.55]; k=6, [.10,.17] vs [.33,.45]. Two psychometric curves that cross each other in opposite directions: the observed crossover location is a direct, interpretable estimate of the strong:weak exchange rate, separated by a factor of ~3 across the two boxes. Km2/Km4/Km6 mirror the ladder for side balance.

FAMILY R (second crossover at a mid-strength reference). R1-R4: A wins the 75% expert vs k 55% experts (k=1..4); Rm3 mirrors. FDEI crossover k* = w(0.75)/w(0.55) in [1.18, 1.46]; SITT in [3.0, 4.1] -- again disjoint. Centers: FDEI .54/.42/.31/.22 vs SITT .72/.64/.55/.45. Two independent exchange-rate estimates, both disjoint, test whether the dissociation scales with reference strength as each theory's weight function demands (FDEI: ER roughly constant ~1.3; SITT: ER shrinks 4.9 -> 3.5 as reference drops from 0.90 to 0.75).

FAMILY D/C/H (cliff cells: 0.98 as anti-cue vs near-equal-cue). D1 (A wins 0.98, B wins 0.90): FDEI box [.50,.53] -- a coin flip, because compressed weights make 98% and 90% nearly exchangeable; SITT box [.04,.06] -- subjects should choose AGAINST the 98% endorsement. D1m mirrors. C1 (A wins 0.90+0.75, B wins 0.98+one 0.55): FDEI [.49,.55] (net evidence ~0); SITT [.93,.97] (the 98% endorsement is worth about one trusted ANTI-cue, so the two trusted experts plus the inversion overwhelm it). C1m mirrors. H2 (A wins 0.98 + two 55%s, B wins 0.90): FDEI [.66,.80] (weak majority plus super-expert beats the peak expert); SITT [.06,.13] (the super-expert's anti-vote sinks the coalition). H2m mirrors. These cells separate a near-tie from a 90-point swing.

HONEST KNIVES AGAINST MY OWN THEORY. K1 and R1 are the sharpest: FDEI's delta<=0.2 compression caps the 90-vs-55 exchange rate at 1.69, so it cannot predict p(A) > 0.59 on K1 or > 0.56 on R1 for ANY parameter setting. If subjects follow the strong expert at p >= 0.70 on K1, my flattening claim is falsified outright and the design doubles as a direct delta-estimation experiment (observed k* maps monotonically onto delta). Conversely K3/K4 and R2/R3 falsify SITT if subjects favor the weak stacks at all (SITT demands p(A) >= 0.51 at K4 for every parameter).

CONTROLS. X1/X2 (one 55% expert won by each side): BOTH theories must predict exactly 0.50 for every parameter -- a parameter-free side/display-bias assay. G1/G1m are agreement anchors (both theories > 0.85 at center: FDEI .94, SITT .96) pinning lapse/temperature. Tied features are a MIX of 0/0 and 1/1 ties so that 'count the 1s' is not a viable heuristic (e.g., K6 has A with three 1s vs B with eight 1s while the theories disagree only about the discriminators). No all-tie trials; every trial requires scanning all 9 experts. 24 unique pairs x K = 96//24 = 4 reps = 96 trials; sides balanced (10 A-tilted, 12 B-tilted, 2 neutral under FDEI centers; every non-anchor family contains an A/B mirror). PREDICTED PATTERN IF MY THEORY IS RIGHT: shallow FDEI psychometrics crossing 0.5 between k=1 and 2 in both ladders, coin flips on D1/C1, A-choice ~0.74 on H2, exactly 0.50 on X. IF THE COMPETITOR IS RIGHT: steep SITT psychometrics crossing between k=4 and 5 (K) and k=3 and 4 (R), near-ceiling strong-expert following at low k, ~0.05 on D1, ~0.95 on C1, ~0.07 on H2. The boxes are disjoint on 20 of 24 cells.

**Computed schedule:** 24 unique pairs × 4 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The single sharpest, most parameter-robust dissociation in this design is the D-family: trials where the 98% expert and the 90% expert endorse opposite options while the 75% expert is tied (trials 15, 16, 19, 20; 4 reps each = 16 trials per subject). The metric is the per-subject (and pooled) probability of FOLLOWING the 98% expert's endorsement on exactly those trials. Under FDEI, delta in [0.1,0.2] compresses log-diagnosticities so heavily that w(0.98)/w(0.90) is at most ~1.12; the net evidence on a pure 98-vs-90 conflict is |s| <= ~0.14, and with beta <= 0.37 the predicted follow rate is boxed in [0.47, 0.53] for ANY parameter setting -- a coin flip. Under SITT, w(0.98) is negative (in [-1.14, -0.70]) while w(0.90) is at its trust peak (~0.95-1.06), so the net score against the 98% endorsement is large (|s| >= ~1.65), giving a follow rate <= ~0.08 even at the weakest parameter corner with maximal lapse. The two theories therefore predict ~0.50 vs ~0.06 on this scalar -- a gap of ~0.44 with tight binomial per-subject variance (<= 0.25/16 ~ 0.016 under FDEI, ~0.005 under SITT), so at N=25 the Welch t-test separates them by t ~ 14. The metric is also robust to whether the six weak experts are 0.50 or 0.55: FDEI annihilates 0.50 cues exactly and even with 0.55 cues the D-cell follow rate only rises to ~0.58, while SITT stays below ~0.10 either way, because the weak-cue contributions are small relative to the 98-vs-90 conflict. Unlike a whole-design fit or a crossover-ladder statistic, this single exchange-rate quantity is directly interpretable (it estimates the subjective 98:90 exchange rate) and is deliberately chosen to be insensitive to lapse rate, softmax gain, and weak-cue weighting -- the parameters the two theories share -- so it isolates exactly the structural claim (flat compression vs inverted-U trust with a cliff) on which they disagree.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.

  "interpretation": "Tallying the two theories against all eight experiments: pi_4 (flattened-diagnosticity integration) is clearly the better overall performer, but it is NOT task-invariant, and neither is pi_5. Per-experiment errors (|observed - predicted|): Exp 1: pi_5 misses by 0.21, pi_4 by 0.26 (observed 0.58 sits between the two predictions \u2014 both fail, mild contrarianism toward the 99% expert that pi_4 cannot produce at all). Exp 2: pi_4 nearly exact (0.54 vs 0.4625 observed); pi_5 catastrophically wrong (0.055 \u2014 its deep cliff forces near-certain anti-following of the 98% expert, but subjects treat 98% vs 90% as a coin flip). Exp 3: pi_4 essentially exact (-0.2188 vs -0.2180); pi_5 overshoots the anti-TTB effect by 2x. Exp 4: both fine (0.0789 / 0.0881 vs 0.0771). Exp 5: pi_4 close (0.6485 vs 0.617), pi_5 predicts chance-level tally-following (0.4996) \u2014 clearly wrong. Exp 6: pi_4 nearly exact (0.5192 vs 0.5133); pi_5 predicts anti-tallying (0.395) \u2014 wrong sign of deviation. Exp 7: pi_5 captures the sign (subjects ANTI-follow 50%-accuracy experts, observed -0.168; pi_5 predicts -0.117) while pi_4 structurally predicts ~0 (it annihilates v=0.5 cues exactly) \u2014 a genuine pi_4 failure. Exp 8: pi_4's worst failure by far (predicts 0.767 strong-side choice, observed 0.118 \u2014 a 65-point miss and a sign-level error: subjects overwhelmingly choose the weak-coalition side against 99% experts); pi_5 is directionally right (0.287) but undershoots the effect. So pi_4 wins Exps 2, 3, 5, 6 decisively; pi_5 wins Exps 7 and 8 (directionally); Exp 1 indeterminate; Exp 4 a tie. The composite data pattern is: (i) 0.98 and 0.90 experts are treated as nearly exchangeable head-to-head (Exp 2: 0.4625 follow); (ii) near-certain experts are strongly discounted/inverted when embedded in cue coalitions (Exp 8: 0.118 strong-side; Exp 1: 0.58 anti-follow); (iii) exactly-chance experts carry a small NEGATIVE weight (Exp 7: -0.168); (iv) otherwise behavior is moderate-gain, near-unweighted tallying (Exps 5, 6: 0.617 / 0.513; Exp 3: -0.218 tally-leaning). pi_4's monotone compressed log-odds weight function is structurally incapable of (ii) and (iii); pi_5's narrow cliff above v=0.96 is structurally incapable of (i) (it puts 0.90 at the trust peak while sending 0.98 deeply negative, forcing a huge 98-vs-90 gap that the data contradict) and it mispredicts the moderate tally-following in Exps 5/6. Since the better theory (pi_4) still fails two experiments badly and the worse theory (pi_5) is the only one with the right sign structure on those failures, the correct move is to replace pi_5 with a new theory that synthesizes pi_5's distrust-of-extremes insight with pi_4's near-flat mid-band \u2014 a stronger competitor to the surviving pi_4 rather than a patch of a degenerate description.",

  "recommendation": "Replace pi_5 with 'Broad-Spectrum Skepticism Tallying' (BSST). Core claim: the subjective weight function w(v) is a WIDE inverted-U with distrust on BOTH flanks, not a narrow cliff: (a) v = 0.5 exactly: small negative weight (kappa_lo ~ 0.10-0.25 trusted-cue units) \u2014 chance-level endorsements are mildly anti-diagnostic (captures Exp 7's -0.168 and Exp 1's ordered X-family cells); (b) v in ~[0.55, 0.85]: a broad, nearly FLAT positive plateau (weights within ~20% of each other) \u2014 this reproduces pi_4's successful tally-like behavior (Exps 3, 5, 6) because near-equal mid-band weights plus low gain generate moderate unweighted-tally following; (c) v greater than ~0.88: distrust begins MUCH earlier and runs MUCH deeper than pi_5's cliff \u2014 w(v) crosses zero around v ~ 0.90-0.92 and saturates at roughly -1.5 to -2.5 trusted-cue units by v ~ 0.99. The critical difference from pi_5: BOTH the 0.90 and the 0.98/0.99 experts sit inside the distrust region, so a pure 98-vs-90 conflict is a near-cancellation of two negative weights (Exp 2's 0.4625 follow rate), while a lone or paired 99% expert against a weak coalition produces a large net anti-super score (Exp 8's 0.118 strong-side rate, Exp 1's 0.58 anti-follow). Keep the shared architecture (sign votes x weights x softmax x lapse) but with low gain (2*beta ~ 0.4-0.8) and small lapse (epsilon ~ 0.04-0.08) to match the moderate tally-following rates (0.51-0.62) in Exps 5 and 6. Implementation: w(v) = plateau(v) for the mid band, a smooth saturating negative lobe for v > v_distrust (~0.88) with depth kappa_hi in [1.5, 2.5], and a small negative lobe at v = 0.5 rising through zero by v ~ 0.55. Parameter ranges: v_distrust in [0.87, 0.93], kappa_hi in [1.2, 2.8], kappa_lo in [0.08, 0.3], plateau height ~0.8-1.0 with plateau flatness exponent near 0, beta in [0.2, 0.45], epsilon in [0.04, 0.09]. This theory should be evaluated head-to-head against pi_4 on all eight experiments; its decisive advantages over pi_4 are the signed predictions on chance-only trials (Exp 7 < 0) and super-expert coalition trials (Exp 8 strong-side well below 0.5), where pi_4 is structurally pinned near 0 and ~0.77 respectively."
