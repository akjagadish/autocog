# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with 'Broad-Spectrum Skepticism Tallying' (BSST). Core claim: the subjective weight function w(v) is a WIDE inverted-U with distrust on BOTH flanks, not a narrow cliff: (a) v = 0.5 exactly: small negative weight (kappa_lo ~ 0.10-0.25 trusted-cue units) — chance-level endorsements are mildly anti-diagnostic (captures Exp 7's -0.168 and Exp 1's ordered X-family cells); (b) v in ~[0.55, 0.85]: a broad, nearly FLAT positive plateau (weights within ~20% of each other) — this reproduces pi_4's successful tally-like behavior (Exps 3, 5, 6) because near-equal mid-band weights plus low gain generate moderate unweighted-tally following; (c) v greater than ~0.88: distrust begins MUCH earlier and runs MUCH deeper than pi_5's cliff — w(v) crosses zero around v ~ 0.90-0.92 and saturates at roughly -1.5 to -2.5 trusted-cue units by v ~ 0.99. The critical difference from pi_5: BOTH the 0.90 and the 0.98/0.99 experts sit inside the distrust region, so a pure 98-vs-90 conflict is a near-cancellation of two negative weights (Exp 2's 0.4625 follow rate), while a lone or paired 99% expert against a weak coalition produces a large net anti-super score (Exp 8's 0.118 strong-side rate, Exp 1's 0.58 anti-follow). Keep the shared architecture (sign votes x weights x softmax x lapse) but with low gain (2*beta ~ 0.4-0.8) and small lapse (epsilon ~ 0.04-0.08) to match the moderate tally-following rates (0.51-0.62) in Exps 5 and 6. Implementation: w(v) = plateau(v) for the mid band, a smooth saturating negative lobe for v > v_distrust (~0.88) with depth kappa_hi in [1.5, 2.5], and a small negative lobe at v = 0.5 rising through zero by v ~ 0.55. Parameter ranges: v_distrust in [0.87, 0.93], kappa_hi in [1.2, 2.8], kappa_lo in [0.08, 0.3], plateau height ~0.8-1.0 with plateau flatness exponent near 0, beta in [0.2, 0.45], epsilon in [0.04, 0.09]. This theory should be evaluated head-to-head against pi_4 on all eight experiments; its decisive advantages over pi_4 are the signed predictions on chance-only trials (Exp 7 < 0) and super-expert coalition trials (Exp 8 strong-side well below 0.5), where pi_4 is structurally pinned near 0 and ~0.77 respectively.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Broad-Spectrum Skepticism Tallying (BSST), sharp-late-cliff calibration. People integrate ALL binary expert ratings as sign votes (+1/-1/0) into a zero-sum evidence score, where the subjective weight w(v) is a wide inverted-U over STATED validity with skepticism on both flanks: (i) chance experts (v = 0.5) carry a small negative weight (~0.19 trusted-cue units) — a coin-flipper's endorsement is mildly anti-diagnostic; (ii) the entire band v ~ [0.55, 0.95] is a flat trust plateau (~0.9), making mid-band experts nearly exchangeable and generating moderate unweighted-tally behavior at low gain; (iii) distrust of claimed certainty is CONCENTRATED in a very sharp cliff located BETWEEN 0.98 and 0.99: w(0.98) stays mildly positive (~0.65, a visible but modest discount), while w(0.99) plunges to ~ -1.0 trusted-cue units, saturating deeper as v -> 1. The critical calibration claims: the 98% and 90% experts are nearly exchangeable (w(0.98) - w(0.90) ~ -0.25), producing mild anti-following in 98-vs-90 conflicts; the 92% top expert of the dual-dissociation design sits at FULL plateau (restoring near-tally regression behavior); and a 99% expert is a moderately strong anti-cue that loses to any 2-cue opposing coalition but does not veto. Choice is a low-gain softmax (2*beta ~ 0.8) over mirrored scores plus a small uniform lapse.

`rationale`:
Minimal-diff edit of the ACCEPTED base: the code is unchanged; only the parameter ranges are recalibrated, exactly along the critic's three knobs. The base's single diagnosable root cause was that the distrust flank was too broad and too shallow in the wrong places — it discounted 0.92-0.95 experts (hurting Exps 2/3/4), over-discounted 0.98 relative to 0.90 (Exp 8: 0.30 vs real 0.4625), and paired a deep-ish 0.99 lobe with an oversized kappa_lo that inflated strong-side choice in Exp 6's coalition cells (0.59 vs real 0.118).

(1) SHARPEN AND RELOCATE the cliff: v_c 0.9675 -> ~0.9865, s_hi 0.026 -> ~0.0029. Now every expert with v <= 0.95 sits at the FULL plateau: w(0.92) = plateau (restores Exp 2's regression toward ~0.08 and recovers tally-following in Exps 3/4, whose undershoot in the base came precisely from mid-high discounts and chance-cue contrarianism); w(0.98) ~ 0.65 gives w(0.98) - w(0.90) ~ -0.25, so pure 98-vs-90 D-cells land at ~0.45 and noise-augmented ones near 0.5, averaging ~0.46 (real 0.4625); w(0.99) ~ -1.0 to -1.1.

(2) SHRINK kappa_lo 0.29 -> ~0.19 and RAISE beta 0.32 -> ~0.40: the chance-only sensitivity scales as (1-eps)*tanh(beta*kappa_lo*|k|) with |k| up to 4, so beta*kappa_lo ~ 0.075 reproduces Exp 5's -0.16 while each opposing chance cue now adds only +0.19 (not +0.29) to a coalition's strong side — removing the inflation that pushed Exp 6's K2/K3 above 0.5 and dragged Exp 4 below chance.

(3) DEEPEN kappa_hi to ~1.7: K2 = w(0.99) + 2*kappa_lo ~ -0.6 -> strong-side ~0.35, K3 ~ 0.40, M3/M4 ~ 0.2, pulling Exp 6 from 0.59 toward the in-family floor ~0.40. I accept the flagged structural residual: the R3 cell (2x0.75 vs 3 chance) is pinned ~0.87 whenever w(0.75) >= 0 > w(0.5), so Exp 6 cannot reach 0.118 without breaking Exps 1-5; per the critic I do not chase it.

Honest cost accounting: with w(0.99) ~ -1.05 at beta 0.40, the 99-alone cells of Exp 7 give anti-follow ~0.69 and the mixed cells less, so Exp 7 drifts from 0.60 to ~0.64 (real 0.580, error ~0.06) — a small squared loss (0.004) traded against the large Exp 6 gain (squared error 0.225 -> ~0.08) plus gains on Exps 8 (0.026 -> ~0.001), 2, 3, 4, and 1. Net aggregate loss should fall well below the 0.2026 floor. Exp 1 recomputation with w(0.98) = 0.65: the 1-vs-2/1-vs-3 conflict rows give p(tally side) ~ 0.72-0.90 and the tie rows ~+0.16, landing the metric near -0.26 (real -0.218, was -0.308).

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2026 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1811 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1811.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a genuine improvement over pi_4/pi_5 on the flanks (Exp 5: -0.157 vs real -0.168, essentially perfect; Exp 7: 0.601 vs real 0.580, good), and the gate correctly accepted it. But three quantitative failures remain, and they share a single diagnosable root cause: the distrust flank is too BROAD and too SHALLOW in the wrong places.

1) Experiment 6 is a catastrophic miss (0.5915 vs real 0.118, error 0.47). The proposer's rationale assumed Exp 6's 'weak experts' sit on the trust plateau ('plateau weights ~0.95 for the weak experts'), but they are v=0.5 CHANCE experts. With kappa_lo ~ 0.29, each chance cue opposing the strong side contributes +kappa_lo to the strong side's score, so K2 = w(0.99) + 2*kappa_lo ~ +0.1 (near 0.5 follow) and, decisively, R3 = 2*w(0.75) + 3*kappa_lo ~ +2.8 (strong-side rate ~0.85). The negative low flank systematically INFLATES strong-side choice in coalition trials — the exact opposite of the data. This is a mis-read of the design, not noise: the arithmetic reproduces the simulated 0.59 almost exactly.

2) Experiment 8 (0.300 vs real 0.4625): the current v_c ~ 0.9675, s_hi ~ 0.026 puts w(0.98) ~ -0.35 while w(0.90) ~ +0.80, a difference of ~-1.15, driving follow rate to 0.30. The data demand w(0.98) - w(0.90) ~ -0.2 to -0.3, i.e., nearly exchangeable 98/90 experts.

3) Experiments 3 (0.505 vs real 0.617) and 4 (0.433 vs real 0.513) show the candidate reproducing pi_5's signature (0.4996, 0.3950): systematic UNDER-following of the tally, even below chance in Exp 4. This is flank contrarianism (negative weights on 0.98/0.99 and/or 0.5 features) flipping small-margin tally trials. Exp 1 (-0.308 vs -0.218) is mildly over-contrarian in the same direction; Exp 2 (0.142 vs 0.077) is slightly too tally because w(0.92) ~ 0.65 is already discounted.

The core insight the proposer themselves stated — but under-applied — is that the distrust drop must be concentrated BETWEEN 0.98 and 0.99, not spread across 0.90-0.99. A sharp cliff at v ~ 0.983-0.988 simultaneously: keeps w(0.92) at full plateau (fixes Exp 2, helps Exps 3/4 if their top cues are <= 0.98), makes w(0.98) ~ w(0.90) - 0.25 (fixes Exp 8), and lets w(0.99) go deeper (-0.8 to -1.2) to pull Exp 6's K2/K3/M3/M4 cells down without re-triggering pi_5's Exp 7 over-contrarianism (0.79).

One structural limit must be flagged honestly: Exp 6's R3 cell (2x0.75 vs 3 chance) is pinned POSITIVE in this family whenever w(0.75) >= 0 and w(0.5) <= 0, because 2*w(0.75) + 3*kappa_lo > 0 always. Matching it would require either distrusting 0.75 (breaks the mid-band trust that wins Exps 1-4) or trusting chance cues (breaks Exp 5's -0.168). Best achievable within the family is ~0.35-0.45 on Exp 6; the proposer should drive toward that floor, not chase 0.118.
Rationale: Accepted by the gate, but a 0.47 error on Exp 6 plus 0.11-0.16 errors on Exps 3/8 is too much to ship. Keep the family (sign votes x inverted-U weights x low-gain softmax x lapse) and recalibrate three knobs on the accepted base:

(1) SHARPEN AND RELOCATE the distrust cliff: move v_c to ~0.982-0.990 and shrink s_hi to ~0.004-0.010, so w(0.98) stays mildly positive (within ~0.3 of the plateau) while w(0.99) drops to ~-0.8 to -1.2. This fixes Exp 8 (w(0.98)-w(0.90) ~ -0.25 gives follow ~0.46), restores w(0.92) to full plateau (fixes Exp 2's overshoot 0.142 -> ~0.08), and recovers tally-following in Exps 3/4 if their top cues are <= 0.98.

(2) SHRINK kappa_lo to ~0.10-0.18 (the arbiter's lower range) and recover Exp 5's -0.168 by raising beta toward 0.37-0.42: the chance-only metric scales like tanh(beta*kappa_lo*|k|) with |k| up to 3, so beta=0.38 x kappa=0.15 x |k|=3 gives ~-0.17 on the high-|k| cells. Smaller kappa_lo directly removes the +n*kappa_lo inflation that pushed Exp 6's K2/K3 above 0.5 and dragged Exp 4 below 0.5.

(3) DEEPEN kappa_hi modestly to ~1.2-1.8 so that K2 = w(0.99)+2*kappa_lo ~ -1.0 to -1.4 and the M-cells go to ~0.1-0.3, pushing Exp 6 toward its in-family floor of ~0.35-0.45. Verify against Exp 7 after this change: with w(0.99) ~ -1.0, the 99-alone cells give anti-follow ~0.63 and the mixed cells ~0.4-0.7, averaging near the real 0.58; if it drifts above ~0.65, trade back toward w(0.99) ~ -0.8.

Do NOT attempt to fix Exp 6's R3 cell (2x0.75 vs 3 chance) by extending distrust down to 0.75 or making w(0.5) positive — both break Exps 1-5. Accept the residual there. Also re-check Exp 1 after the recalibration; the current -0.308 (too anti-TTB) should relax toward -0.22 as both flank magnitudes shrink.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2026 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1811 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "The iter-2 recalibration did what my iter-1 critique asked, and the gate correctly accepted it: the distrust cliff was relocated and sharpened (v_c ~0.9865, s_hi ~0.0029), kappa_lo was shrunk, kappa_hi deepened. The predicted payoffs materialized: Exp 6 dropped from 0.5915 to 0.4215 (essentially the in-family floor I predicted), Exp 8 jumped from 0.300 to 0.436 (real 0.4625), Exp 1 relaxed from -0.308 to -0.254, Exp 2 from 0.142 to 0.119, and Exp 5 held at -0.155 (real -0.168). The sharp-cliff-between-0.98-and-0.99 calibration is now empirically vindicated against the arbiter's broader-distrust variant (pi_5 scores 0.055 on Exp 8; this candidate scores 0.436), while staying inside the prescribed sign-votes \u00d7 inverted-U weights \u00d7 low-gain softmax \u00d7 lapse architecture.\n\nHowever, the recalibration overshot on a cluster of three experiments that share a single root cause: the model is now TOO contrarian on trials containing the 0.99 expert and/or chance cues. (1) Exp 7: 0.6849 vs real 0.5796 \u2014 I explicitly pre-registered this failure mode ('if it drifts above ~0.65, trade back toward w(0.99) ~ -0.8'); with kappa_hi ~1.7 the implied w(0.99) \u2248 -1.05 to -1.25, and at beta 0.40 a lone 99 yields an anti-follow logit near -0.9, pushing the index to 0.685. (2) Exp 3: 0.4630 vs real 0.6170 \u2014 the candidate is now the WORST of all six reference theories on this metric (even below pi_5's 0.4996); small-margin tally trials whose weighted score is flipped by the deep 0.99 lobe and the -0.19 chance-cue weight are decided against the tally, and the beta raise (0.32\u21920.40) sharpened those flips. (3) Exp 4: 0.3808 vs real 0.5133 \u2014 again worst-in-class and below chance; the |d|=1 family includes pairs discriminated only by flank cues (a lone 0.99, or twin chance cues contributing -2\u00b7kappa_lo), and both flanks now push below 0.5 where the real data sit barely above it.\n\nThe remaining error budget is dominated by this one miscalibration (Exps 3/4/7 squared errors total ~0.052) plus the structural Exp 6 residual (0.092, pinned by the R3 cell as previously flagged). The fix is a coordinated, in-family retune of the two flank magnitudes against the gain, not a redesign.",

  "rationale": "Verdict regenerate \u2014 the candidate is the accepted base and improved on my iter-1 advice, but it is now the worst-performing theory on Exps 3 and 4 and clearly overshoots on Exp 7, all for one diagnosable reason: w(0.99) \u2248 -1.05 to -1.25 (kappa_hi 1.5-1.9 through the sharp logistic) is too deep at beta 0.40, and kappa_lo ~0.19 is still large enough to flip small-margin trials decided by chance cues. Keep the cliff LOCATION frozen (v_c ~0.9855-0.987, s_hi ~0.0025-0.0033) \u2014 it is what fixed Exps 2 and 8, which are now essentially solved; do not touch it. Instead: (a) pull kappa_hi down to ~1.25-1.45 so w(0.99) lands at ~-0.75 to -0.9 \u2014 this is not an oscillation, it is the middle of my originally advised -0.8 to -1.2 window, and it is the exact 'trade back toward -0.8' I pre-registered if Exp 7 exceeded 0.65 (it hit 0.685); (b) cut kappa_lo to ~0.10-0.14, which directly removes the anti-tally flip on Exp 4's chance-cue-only |d|=1 pairs and reduces the +n\u00b7kappa_lo inflation of Exp 6's weak coalitions (partially offsetting the shallower 0.99 lobe there, so Exp 6 should stay near 0.40-0.45 rather than regress); (c) hold Exp 5 by raising beta to the top of the arbiter's range (~0.42-0.45), keeping beta\u00b7kappa_lo \u2248 0.05-0.06 \u2014 accept a mild Exp 5 cost (metric drifting from -0.155 toward ~-0.11) as the price. Expected outcome: Exp 7 \u2192 ~0.60-0.63, Exp 4 \u2192 ~0.44-0.48, Exp 3 \u2192 ~0.52-0.56, with Exps 1/2/6/8 roughly unchanged \u2014 a net squared-error reduction below the 0.1811 floor. As before: do NOT chase Exp 6's 0.118 (the R3 cell, 2\u00d70.75 vs 3 chance, is structurally pinned near 0.85 whenever w(0.75) \u2265 0 > w(0.5); matching it would require distrusting 0.75 or trusting chance cues, breaking Exps 1-5), and do not re-broaden the distrust region toward the arbiter's original 0.90-crossing \u2014 the head-to-head data (Exp 8: 0.436 vs pi_5's 0.055) show the sharp late cliff is the empirically correct calibration within the family."
