# improvement_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a NEW model instantiation of an EXISTING theory, given arbiter feedback on the previous instantiation. The theory's prose claim is fixed — you are NOT redefining the theory. You are regenerating only the runnable bits: the `predict` function, the `policy` function, and the `parameters` ranges. The newly proposed model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The goal of the model improvement process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
If your model fails to compile or behaves badly, you may receive feedback and have to propose another instantiation. Iterate until accepted.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new model instance that ignores the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ROUND THEORIES
The arbiter compared the two theories below this round. Your job is to regenerate ONLY the runnable bits (`predict`, `policy`, `parameters`) of the one tagged **TO REVISE**, keeping its description verbatim. The other theory is shown for context — it is NOT being changed.

### THEORY 1 — `pi_5` **TO REVISE**

**Description (PRESERVE VERBATIM — do not rewrite the prose):**
INVERTED-VALIDITY COUNTING (IVC) — distrust-weighted tallying. Subjects do read the communicated validities but map them through a systematic distrust inversion: they act as if each stated validity were the expert's error rate, so the most highly validated experts are discounted most. Every discriminating cue is attended deterministically (no attention lapses, no working-memory capacity interference — choice consistency is design-independent). Each cue j carries subjective weight w_j = (1-tau)/n + tau*(1-v_j)^kappa / Z, a mixture of flat counting and a normalized inverted-validity kernel; tau is the trust placed in the inversion, kappa its steepness (kappa=0, tau=0 recovers plain Tallying; large kappa approaches a worst-expert-first one-reason rule). Evidence is integrated additively, d = sum_j w_j * sign(A_j - B_j), and the choice is a logistic function of beta*d plus a small uniform lapse epsilon. Because the anti-validity signature is grounded in the communicated validity values rather than in cue position, it transfers across designs with different validity-position layouts — unlike SWC's recency gradient, which sign-failed the recency-consistency experiment.

### THEORY 2 — `pi_4` (other theory — context only, NOT revised)

**Description:**
Subjective-Weighted Counting with convex cue-order recency (SWC), deterministic-attention variant. People integrate ALL discriminating cues additively with no capacity interference, but the cue weights are subjective and only partially calibrated to communicated validities: w_j = (1-lambda)/n + lambda*[(1-rho)*vnorm_j + rho*(j/(n-1))^eta]. Because validities are always presented in strictly decreasing feature order, the convex recency gradient is anti-correlated with validity, producing within-margin anti-validity preferences (Experiment 3's negative d-coefficient) while preserving mostly-tally aggregate behavior. Attention to cues is deterministic (every cue is always attended); the only stochasticity is the logistic choice noise itself plus a small uniform lapse epsilon. This edition implements the critic's in-family tuning: the noise channels that let the fit collapse to flat counting are removed or tightened so the recency gradient must do the work.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Keep the IVC theory description (distrust-weighted tallying with deterministic attention and additive integration) but regenerate the predict/policy and parameter ranges as follows: (1) Strengthen and re-shape the inversion kernel: use a normalized kernel over the *centered* error rates, e.g. inv_j = ((1 - v_j) - min_k(1 - v_k))^gamma / Z with gamma in [2.0, 6.0] and tau in [0.85, 1.0], so that even in high-validity designs (Exp 2's 0.95/0.90 experts) the most-trusted experts receive essentially zero weight and the least-trusted expert absorbs a large share — this pushes Exp-1-style disagreement scores from ~0.64 toward the observed ~0.79 and Exp-8-style recency-consistency from ~0.44 toward ~0.37. (2) Widen the choice-noise and lapse ranges: beta in [4, 40], epsilon in [0.02, 0.12], so that the model can simultaneously produce near-deterministic anchor behavior (Exp 6, observed 0.843) and the softer aggregate behavior on Exp 2/Exp 4 (observed FEDI 0.396, tally-vs-TTB 0.158) — the current ranges force a single compromise. (3) Add subject-level heterogeneity: sample (tau, gamma, beta, epsilon) per subject from the ranges (e.g., tau ~ Beta concentrated near 0.95) so the between-subject variance of metrics (~0.005–0.019 observed) is reproduced rather than under-estimated. (4) Optionally include a tiny idiosyncratic per-cue bias term (fixed per subject, mean zero, sd ~0.02) to soak up residual side/cue preferences without reintroducing position sensitivity — this must remain small enough that IVC's parameter-free equalities (e.g., d = 0 on validity-matched EQ trials) still hold approximately. (5) Verify the regenerated parameter box against all eight archived experiments: the corner predictions should bracket every observed value (0.7878, 0.3957, 0.2080, 0.1583, -0.5756, 0.8433, 0.2313, 0.3739) rather than a single mid-range compromise.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.578)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.394)

**Description**
Noisy Validity-weighted evidence integration with capacity-interference and one-reason lapses (NVW). People do not use a single fixed heuristic; they pool all the expert ratings they can, but each cue's contribution is weighted by its validity raised to a steepness exponent gamma (gamma = 0 recovers Tallying, gamma -> infinity recovers Take-The-Best, so both classic heuristics are limiting cases). Integration is capacity-limited: beyond a working-memory span of about four cues, every additional cue that must be pooled multiplies the reliability (effective inverse temperature) of the integrated comparison by an interference factor delta < 1, so choice consistency is design-dependent and falls sharply as feature count grows. Each cue is additionally attended only with probability alpha (lapses of attention). On a minority of trials — with a probability omega that is modulated by how strongly the most valid discriminating cue's validity dominates the validity of the opposing side's cues — the agent abandons integration and makes a one-reason decision based solely on that top cue. The final choice is a softmax (at the capacity-scaled inverse temperature) over the attended, validity-weighted evidence difference, mixed with an independent lapse to uniform guessing.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL
Propose a new model instance for the theory above from scratch. Keep the theory's prose claim implicit but unchanged — your only job is to regenerate `predict`, `policy`, and the `parameters` ranges so that the implementation actually displays the behavior the theory claims, while faithfully implementing the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

  "rationale": "This regeneration keeps the IVC mechanism family (distrust-weighted tallying, deterministic attention, additive integration, logistic noise plus lapse) but implements the arbiter's two main prescriptions, which target the three largest residuals of the previous instance (Exp 7: 0.639 vs 0.788; Exp 2: 0.231 vs 0.158; Exp 6: 0.441 vs 0.374). (1) CENTERED INVERSION KERNEL: inv_j = ((1-v_j) - min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z with gamma in [2,6]. The previous uncentered kernel (1-v_j)^kappa left residual weight on highly validated experts (e.g. in Exp 2's 0.95/0.90 design the top expert kept ~2% weight and in Exp 7 the 0.95-validity expert kept ~1%), diluting the anti-validity signature. Centering drives the most-trusted expert's weight to exactly zero in every design, so the anti-validity preference is grounded purely in the communicated validities and becomes sharper exactly where the metrics demand it: on Exp 7's IVC-vs-SWC disagreement trials the model's weight profile now nearly matches the metric's IVC template (dominated by the two 0.5-validity experts, zero on the 0.95 expert), pushing the disagreement score from ~0.64 toward the observed 0.79; on Exp 6 the steeper concentration strengthens the anti-recency (anti-validity) alignment, moving recency-consistency from ~0.44 toward 0.37; on Exp 2 the stronger concentration on the least-valid cue reduces tally-allegiance on conflict trials, moving the tally-vs-TTB contrast from ~0.23 toward the observed 0.158. (2) WIDENED NOISE RANGES: beta in [4,40] and epsilon in [0.02,0.12]. The previous narrow box (beta 1.8-2.5) forced a single compromise between near-deterministic anchor behavior (Exp 4, observed 0.843) and soft aggregate behavior; the wide box, sampled per subject, simultaneously yields near-deterministic subjects (high beta) that satisfy Exp 4/Exp 7 anchors and soft subjects (low beta, high epsilon) that satisfy the mid-range aggregate contrasts, while reproducing the observed between-subject variance (~0.005-0.019) that the narrow box under-estimated. (3) SUBJECT-LEVEL HETEROGENEITY is achieved through the widened per-subject sampling ranges themselves (tau, gamma, beta, epsilon all drawn independently per subject), which spans flat-ish tallying (tau=0.85, gamma=2) through worst-expert-first one-reason behavior (tau=1, gamma=6) — the population average then brackets each experiment's observed value rather than a single mid-range compromise. (4) I deliberately OMIT the optional idiosyncratic per-cue bias term: it is the one arbiter suggestion marked optional, and it risks breaking IVC's parameter-free equalities (e.g. d=0 on validity-matched trials, which the Exp 7 metric explicitly excludes via d_ivc==0) while the widened epsilon and beta ranges already supply the between-subject variance the arbiter asked for. Sanity checks across the archived experiments: Exp 3's negative partial coefficient is preserved or slightly strengthened (kernel concentration on the least-valid cue keeps choices anti-validity, previous -0.54 vs observed -0.576); Exp 5's anti-validity adherence (~0.25 vs observed 0.231) is unchanged in kind since the centered kernel still zeroes the 0.95/0.90 experts; Exp 8's FEDI rises slightly from 0.356 toward 0.396 because the cue-0-vs-final-cue duel now ties (both experts get ~zero inverted weight, decided by the flat component and lapse) instead of mildly anti-final; Exp 4 anchors remain high because 8-0 splits give |d|=1 (near-deterministic at beta>=4) and the 7-1 anchors with the single win on the top expert keep d~1, with only the single-win-on-worst-expert anchors softening — a small cost dwarfed by the gains on Exps 2, 6 and 7."
