# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5_1" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5_1
INVERTED-VALIDITY COUNTING (IVC) — distrust-weighted tallying. Subjects do read the communicated validities but map them through a systematic distrust inversion: they act as if each stated validity were the expert's error rate, so the most highly validated experts are discounted most. Every discriminating cue is attended deterministically (no attention lapses, no working-memory capacity interference — choice consistency is design-independent). Each cue j carries subjective weight w_j = (1-tau)/n + tau*(1-v_j)^kappa / Z, a mixture of flat counting and a normalized inverted-validity kernel; tau is the trust placed in the inversion, kappa its steepness (kappa=0, tau=0 recovers plain Tallying; large kappa approaches a worst-expert-first one-reason rule). Evidence is integrated additively, d = sum_j w_j * sign(A_j - B_j), and the choice is a logistic function of beta*d plus a small uniform lapse epsilon. Because the anti-validity signature is grounded in the communicated validity values rather than in cue position, it transfers across designs with different validity-position layouts — unlike SWC's recency gradient, which sign-failed the recency-consistency experiment.

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
PRIMACY-WEIGHTED INVERTED-VALIDITY COUNTING (PW-IVC). Subjects read the communicated validities but systematically distrust-invert them: they act as if each stated validity were the expert's error rate, so highly validated experts are discounted most (the anti-validity signature). Independently and additively, subjective attention is tilted toward EARLY-presented cues by a steep convex primacy gradient concentrated on the first one or two positions, at a small-to-moderate share of the subjective-weight mixture so the distrust kernel retains dominance wherever validity information varies. Each cue j carries weight w_j = (1-tau)/n + tau * [ (1-rho) * ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z_v + rho * ((n-j)/(n-1))^eta / Z_p ]; evidence d = sum_j w_j * sign(A_j - B_j) is integrated additively over all discriminating cues; choice is logistic in beta*d with a small uniform lapse epsilon. On tied-validity designs the distrust kernel is exactly flat and the primacy kernel alone supplies the early-vs-late contrast, producing below-chance recency-following; on decreasing-validity layouts the distrust kernel dominates and reproduces the anti-validity regression signature.

**Rationale:** STRUCTURAL LEVER. IVC and PW-IVC share the distrust-inversion kernel; they differ ONLY in that PW-IVC adds a convex primacy gradient concentrated on the first one or two positions (mixture share tau*rho in [0.14, 0.29]; positions 1-2 carry ~82-94% of the primacy kernel, and position 1 alone carries 0.53-0.72). IVC's weights are a function of validity VALUES ONLY -- strictly position-invariant. The design therefore manipulates POSITION while holding validity allegiances fixed, using the layout v = [0.95, 0.60, 0.60, 0.95, 0.60, 0.95], which (i) decorrelates validity from position (three 0.60 experts at positions 2,3,5; three 0.95 experts at positions 1,4,6), (ii) places a 0.95 expert at POSITION 1 -- the maximal-primacy slot carrying ~0.1% of IVC's kernel mass -- creating head-to-head primacy-vs-distrust conflicts, and (iii) triplicates each validity level, enabling validity-matched cells where IVC is pinned to exact point predictions. Because (0.40/0.05)^gamma is ~125-340, the three 0.60 experts absorb ~99.8% of the distrust kernel: every 0.60-vs-0.95 allegiance imbalance moves d by ~tau*(1/3) regardless of which positions are involved. All boxes below were verified at the corners of both parameter spaces, respecting the coupling between the kernel coefficient tau*(1-rho) and the primacy coefficient tau*rho.

AXIS 1 -- VALIDITY-MATCHED PRIMACY DOSE LADDER (trials 1-14). Duels and coalitions whose validity multisets match exactly (e.g., A wins the 0.95 expert at position 1 vs B the 0.95 expert at position 6; A wins {0.95@1, 0.60@2} vs B {0.60@5, 0.95@6}). IVC: d = 0 EXACTLY for every parameter combination -> P = 0.500 parameter-free on ALL 14 matched cells. PW-IVC: d = tau*rho*(primacy contrast) > 0 strictly, growing with position contrast: near-zero dose D3 (positions 4 vs 6) P in [0.50, 0.52]; low doses (0.60-duels, positions 2v3, 3v5, 2v5) P in [0.50, 0.63]; high dose D1 (position 1 vs 6) P in [0.53, 0.82]; max dose C1 ({1,2} vs {5,6}) P in [0.55, 0.86]. Observed preference >= 0.55 for the earlier expert's product on the D1/C1 family is impossible for IVC at ANY admissible parameter combination; flat 0.500 across the ladder falsifies PW-IVC. The slope of P versus primacy contrast is EXACTLY 0 under IVC and strictly positive under PW-IVC -- a parametric signature.

AXIS 2 -- FIVE-WAY EXACT EQUALITY (T1a/T1b/T1c/M7a/M7b + mirrors; trials 15-20, 25-28). All five hold validity allegiances fixed (T1: A wins one 0.60 vs B one 0.95; M7: A wins two 0.60 + one 0.95 vs B one 0.60 + two 0.95) while permuting positions, so d_IVC = tau*(w60 - w95) IDENTICALLY: IVC predicts ONE probability, box [0.59, 0.81], on all TEN cells. PW-IVC predicts a strict ordering for every admissible parameter set: M7a (A's wins at positions 1-3) [0.65, 0.91] > T1b (0.60@2 vs 0.95@6) [0.57, 0.90] > T1c (0.60@3 vs 0.95@4) [0.53, 0.87] > T1a (0.60@5 vs 0.95@1) [0.50, 0.79] > M7b (A's wins at 3,5,6 vs B's at 1,2,4) [0.44, 0.77]. On M7b PW-IVC's box dips BELOW CHANCE on the very allegiance pattern where it predicts 0.65-0.91 when positions are permuted, while IVC requires the same probability. Any reliable spread across the family (or a sub-0.5 proportion on M7b) kills IVC; equality kills PW-IVC.

AXIS 3 -- 2v2 TRANSFER (trials 21-24). A wins both 0.60s, B both 0.95s, positions permuted (A@{2,3} vs B@{4,6} vs A@{3,5} vs B@{1,4}). IVC: identical [0.68, 0.93] on all four cells. PW-IVC: T2a [0.75, 0.92] vs T2b [0.59, 0.89] with a pointwise strict ordering -- a required spread where IVC requires exactly 0.

AXIS 4 -- PRIMACY-RESCUE (trials 31-32). The product endorsed by the three 95% experts (positions 1, 4, 6) vs the product endorsed by a single 60% expert (position 5). IVC: the worst-expert veto, P(60%-product) in [0.57, 0.81]. PW-IVC: position-1 primacy (0.53-0.72 of the primacy kernel) fights the distrust kernel, d in [-0.03, +0.17], P in [0.42, 0.78] with sub-chance values at strong-primacy corners -- a confidence dilution (and possible sign reversal) IVC cannot produce anywhere in its box.

AXIS 5 -- SHARED-CORE ANCHOR AND NULL CONTROL (trials 29-30; trial 3-4). E2: the three 60% experts' product vs the three 95% experts' product at a 3-3 count tie: both theories confidently favor the 60% product (IVC [0.74, 0.95], PW [0.71, 0.97]) -- verifying that subjects read and distrust-invert the communicated validities (and screening out plain tallying, which predicts exactly 0.5). D3 (0.95@4 vs 0.95@6) is the zero-dose rung: both theories ~0.5, assaying generic side/late-position bias.

PARAMETRIC SIGNATURE. IVC predicts only FIVE distinct probability levels across all 32 pairs (exactly 0.500 on the 14 matched cells; one level on the ten T1/M7 cells; one on the four T2 cells; one on E2; one on V1; mirrors give complements), with EXACT equalities within families. PW-IVC predicts a position-graded profile that breaks every equality in a parameter-free direction. Regressing P(A) on primacy evidence (position-gradient-weighted cue signs, e.g., eta=5) controlling for inverted-validity evidence yields a primacy coefficient of exactly 0 under IVC and strictly positive under PW-IVC. 32 unique pairs, K = 96 // 32 = 3 repetitions in independently randomized order = exactly 96 trials; every cell appears in A/B-mirrored form (16 complement pairs) to absorb side bias.

**Computed schedule:** 32 unique pairs × 3 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
PRIMACY SLOPE AT FIXED VALIDITY ALLEGIANCE. The two theories share the distrust-inversion kernel and differ ONLY in the position-dependent primacy component, so the metric must isolate position effects while absorbing all validity-based structure. Key algebraic fact: for ANY position-invariant weight vector w (IVC at any tau/gamma/c, plain tallying, plus any lapse), the latent evidence is w·s = (w60−w95)·c1 + w95·c2, where c1 = (s2+s3+s5) is the 0.60-expert allegiance count and c2 = total signed cue count. Hence P(choose A) is a function of the cell (c1, c2) alone. The metric groups trials by (c1, c2) (9 non-empty cells in this design: the 14 validity-matched pairs form cell (0,0); the T1/M7 family forms (±1,0); T2 forms (±2,0); E2 forms (±3,0); V1 forms (∓1,±2)), demeans a fixed reference primacy kernel score x1 = w_prim·s (eta=5, the midpoint of PW-IVC's eta range, so the kernel mismatch attenuation is <2% at both eta corners) within cell, and returns the OLS slope of choice on the demeaned score. Because the within-cell sum of the demeaned regressor is exactly zero, the population slope is EXACTLY 0 under IVC for every admissible parameter combination — the per-subject distribution under IVC is pure binomial noise (SD ≈ 0.11 from ~0.22 residual variance over Σx̃² ≈ 18.2 across 96 trials), with no parameter heterogeneity contribution. Under PW-IVC the slope is strictly positive at every parameter point: within-cell position contrasts (e.g., M7a x1=+0.93 vs M7b x1=−0.72 inside cell (1,0); the matched-cell dose ladder inside cell (0,0); T2a vs T2b inside cell (2,0)) all push choices toward the earlier-position option. Corner calculations give slopes ≈ 0.05 (beta=2.2, rho=0.16), ≈ 0.15 (mid-range), ≈ 0.30 (beta=8, rho=0.30), i.e., mean ≈ 0.14–0.15 with between-subject SD ≈ 0.12 (binomial + parameter spread). At N=25 the Welch t-statistic is ≈ 4+ (p ≈ 1e-4), comfortably below alpha=0.01, with the IVC side pinned at zero variance-inflating structure. The metric works identically on the pooled DataFrame and on single-subject slices (each subject sees all 32 pairs × 3 reps, so cells are identically composed).

**Rationale:** STRUCTURAL LEVER. PW-IVC and IVC share the identical distrust-inversion kernel ((1-v)-centered, gamma-steep); they differ ONLY in that PW-IVC adds a convex primacy gradient concentrated on positions 1-2 (mixture share tau*rho in [0.14, 0.29]; position 1 alone carries 53-72% of the primacy kernel). IVC's weights are a function of validity VALUES ONLY -- strictly position-invariant. The design therefore manipulates POSITION while holding validity allegiances exactly fixed, using the layout v = [0.90, 0.60, 0.60, 0.60, 0.60, 0.90]: the two 0.90 experts occupy the EXTREME positions 1 and 6 (maximal position contrast at TIED validity), and the four 0.60 experts form an interior equal-validity block (positions 2-5) enabling a pure within-block position-gradient assay. Because (0.40/0.10)^gamma is ~23-256 across both boxes, the 0.60 experts absorb ~97-99% of the distrust kernel, so every 0.90-vs-0.60 allegiance imbalance moves d by ~-0.245 (normalized) under BOTH theories -- the distrust signal is held constant while primacy varies. All boxes below were verified at the corners of both parameter spaces.

AXIS 1 -- MATCHED-VALIDITY PRIMACY DOSE LADDER (20 of 32 trials: D0, Z1, D1, W1, W2, D2, D2b, D3, D4, D5 + mirrors). Every cell has IDENTICAL validity multisets on the two sides (e.g., D5: A wins {0.90@1, 0.60@2, 0.60@3} vs B wins {0.60@4, 0.60@5, 0.90@6}), so the distrust kernel and the flat kernel cancel EXACTLY: IVC predicts P(A) = 0.500 PARAMETER-FREE on all twenty (d = 0 for every tau, gamma, c; the lapse preserves 0.5). PW-IVC predicts d = tau*rho*C, where C is the primacy contrast (normalized position-gradient evidence), spanning C ~ 0.04 (D0: 0.60@3 vs 0.60@4) to C ~ 0.98 (D5). Verified boxes: D0 [0.50, 0.53] (near-null control rung), Z1 [0.51, 0.59], D1 [0.51, 0.64], W1 [0.52, 0.68], W2 [0.52, 0.75], D2 (0.90@1 vs 0.90@6 duel) [0.53, 0.82], D2b [0.51, 0.73], D3 [0.54, 0.84], D4 [0.55, 0.88], D5 [0.55, 0.88]. Headline cells: on D5 and D4, observed P(A) >= 0.55 is IMPOSSIBLE for IVC at any admissible parameter combination and REQUIRED by PW-IVC; observed P(A) <= 0.52 falsifies PW-IVC's entire space. The regression slope of P(A) on C is EXACTLY 0 under IVC and strictly positive under PW-IVC -- a parametric signature, with the ladder's monotone ordering (D0 < Z1 < D1 < W1/W2 < D2/D2b < D3 < D4 < D5) providing 10 ordered rungs.

AXIS 2 -- POSITION-PERMUTATION FAMILY AT FIXED ALLEGIANCE (X2a, X2b, X2d + mirrors). All three hold the allegiance fixed at A wins {one 0.90, one 0.60}, B wins {two 0.60s}, permuting only positions. IVC: d = w(0.90) - w(0.60) IDENTICALLY on all three -> one probability, box [0.25, 0.43] (confident preference for the B product, endorsed by two 60% experts). PW-IVC: graded by primacy -- X2a (A's wins at positions 1,2 vs B's at 4,5) box [0.37, 0.69], STRADDLING/ABOVE chance because position-1 primacy (up to tau*rho*0.93) rivals the distrust deficit ((1-rho)*0.245); X2b (A at 1,5 vs B at 2,4) box [0.44, 0.50], near chance; X2d (A at 5,6 vs B at 2,3) box [0.12, 0.39], confidently B. Pointwise, PW-IVC REQUIRES a spread P(X2a) - P(X2d) >= ~0.07 (up to 0.55 at high-rho/high-beta corners) where IVC requires EXACTLY 0. Any reliable within-family spread falsifies IVC's position-invariance; exact equality falsifies PW-IVC. X2a is the design's two-sided adversarial cell: if subjects robustly distrust-follow here (P(A) <= 0.43), PW-IVC's primacy share is bounded small -- but then the Axis-1 ladder must be flat at 0.500, which is itself PW-falsifying; the joint pattern is winnowing in both directions.

AXIS 3 -- PRIMACY-DILUTED WORST-EXPERT VETO (V1 + mirror). A wins the single 0.60@2 expert vs B winning BOTH 0.90 experts (positions 1 and 6). Both theories' distrust kernels favor A (the less valid expert's endorsement counts more), but PW-IVC's primacy simultaneously favors B (positions 1 and 6 carry the maximal primacy mass): IVC box [0.55, 0.75], PW-IVC box [0.53, 0.66] -- a confidence dissociation (observed P(A) >= 0.70 is impossible for PW-IVC), and V1 also screens out plain tallying (which would pick B, 2 cues > 1).

AXIS 4 -- ANCHORS. E1 (all four 0.60 experts vs both 0.90 experts): both theories confidently favor the 0.60 product (IVC [0.75, 0.95], PW [0.76, 0.96]), verifying that subjects read and distrust-invert the communicated validities. TOT (total split): comprehension anchor, both ~1.

AGGREGATE SIGNATURE. IVC predicts exactly 0.500 on all 20 matched cells plus ONE identical probability on the six X2-family cells -- i.e., only ~4 distinct probability levels across all 32 pairs. PW-IVC predicts a position-graded profile breaking every equality in a parameter-free direction. Regressing P(A) on primacy contrast C (computed at a reference eta, e.g., 5) with inverted-validity evidence controlled (it is exactly zero on the matched cells by construction) yields a primacy coefficient of exactly 0 under IVC and strictly positive under PW-IVC. Every cell appears in A/B-mirrored form (16 complement pairs) to absorb side and position bias. 32 unique pairs, K = 96 // 32 = 3 repetitions in independently randomized order = exactly 96 trials per subject.

**Computed schedule:** 32 unique pairs × 3 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The design's core lever is that on the 20 validity-matched cells (trials 1-20), any validity-only weighting (IVC) gives d = 0 exactly, so P(A) = 0.500 parameter-free (lapse preserves 0.5). PW-IVC instead produces d = tau*rho * (primacy contrast), so P(A) is graded by how early A's winning cues sit. The metric is the OLS slope of choice (coded +1/-1) on the primacy contrast C (reference eta=5 gradient), computed only on trials whose winning-cue validity multisets are identical across sides; the six X2-family cells (2 wins per side, unequal multisets) are added with a single +-1 orientation dummy Z that exactly absorbs IVC's constant allegiance effect there (all X2 cells share d = w(0.9)-w(0.6) under any validity-only weights, and the mirror shares its negative), so IVC's expected slope on C is exactly zero on the full included set. Under PW-IVC the slope is strictly positive: expected value approx (1-eps)*beta*tau*rho/2 per unit C in the small-signal regime, ranging ~0.12 (weak corner) to ~0.8 (saturated corner), typically ~0.35-0.40. Per-subject noise SD of the slope is about 1/sqrt(sum C^2) ~ 0.19-0.22 (60-78 binary trials with |C| up to ~1), so at N=25 the Welch t-statistic is roughly 5+ (IVC mean 0, var ~0.05; PW mean ~0.37, var ~0.07), comfortably below alpha=0.01. The metric works identically on pooled and single-subject slices since C and Z are pure stimulus-derived covariates, and it is not trivially true for PW-IVC (weak-parameter corners yield slopes near zero), but it is exactly zero-mean under IVC at every admissible parameter, giving a sharp, low-variance contrast.

Source:
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """
    Primacy-slope metric on validity-matched cells (with X2-family
    orientation absorbed by a dummy).

    Logic: on every trial where the two options' winning-cue validity
    multisets are IDENTICAL (the 20 matched cells: D0,Z1,D1,W1,W2,D2,
    D2b,D3,D4,D5 + mirrors), the distrust kernel and the flat counting
    kernel cancel EXACTLY, so IVC predicts P(A)=0.500 parameter-free
    (the lapse preserves 0.5). PW-IVC predicts a systematic deviation
    graded by the primacy contrast C = w_prim . sign(A-B), with a
    steep convex reference gradient (eta=5).

    We also include the six X2-family cells (2 wins per side, unequal
    validity multisets). Under IVC all X2 cells share ONE probability
    that depends only on orientation (A-won-the-0.9 vs mirror), so a
    single +-1 orientation dummy Z absorbs IVC's entire mean structure
    there; the within-family position spread then loads on C.

    Metric = OLS coefficient of C in y ~ 1 + C + Z, with y = +1 (chose
    A) / -1 (chose B). Under IVC this coefficient is EXACTLY 0 in
    expectation for every admissible parameter. Under PW-IVC it is
    strictly positive (roughly 2*(1-eps)*beta*tau*rho scale), typically
    0.15-0.8.

    # With all six validities equal (0.95), IVC's weight vector is EXACTLY
    # flat for every admissible parameter combination (the distrust kernel
    # is constant across features, so w_j = 1/n identically). Hence on any
    # trial where the two options win an equal number of discriminating
    # cues (count difference = 0), IVC's evidence d = 0 and P(choose A) =
    # 0.50 exactly -- the lapse preserves 0.5. This is parameter-free.

    # SWC, in contrast, has strictly increasing weights in cue position
    # (lambda >= 0.8, rho >= 0.8, convex recency), and on count-neutral
    # trials its evidence reduces EXACTLY to d = lambda*rho*sum_j pos_j*s_j,
    # so it must prefer the option supported by the LATER cues, with
    # subject-level choice rates roughly in [0.60, 0.79].

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all twelve experiments, PW-IVC (pi_6) is clearly the stronger theory, and IVC (pi_5_1) is structurally falsified. (1) The two headline experiments are decisive against IVC's core claim of position-invariance: the within-allegiance-cell primacy slope is predicted to be EXACTLY 0 under IVC at every parameter, yet the observed values are 0.3148 (Exp1) and 0.5396 (Exp2) \u2014 far outside IVC's pure-binomial noise band (predicted -0.003 and 0.034). PW-IVC gets the direction and rough magnitude right (0.175, 0.403) though it systematically UNDERESTIMATES the primacy effect. (2) The broader experiment set independently corroborates a primacy (anti-recency) signature that IVC cannot produce anywhere in its box: Exp11 recency-following on count-neutral tied-validity trials is 0.3414 (IVC pinned at 0.50; PW 0.41), Exp8 recency-consistency 0.3739 (IVC 0.44, PW 0.34), Exp10 final-expert dominance 0.3957 (IVC 0.34, PW 0.28), Exp12 early-favored score -0.1729 (IVC -0.046, PW -0.223). (3) Where the distrust-inversion kernel is the dominant signal, both theories do well and IVC occasionally edges out PW-IVC: Exp3 (0.208 vs IVC 0.187 / PW 0.175), Exp5 (-0.576 vs -0.562 / -0.470), Exp6 (0.843 vs 0.822 / 0.906), Exp7 (0.231 vs 0.237 / 0.256), Exp10. But these are small-margin wins, whereas IVC's failures are large and qualitative (Exp1 error 0.32, Exp2 error 0.51, Exp9 error 0.14, Exp11 error 0.16). Summing absolute errors: IVC \u2248 1.57 vs PW-IVC \u2248 0.87. (4) PW-IVC's residual weaknesses are quantitative, not structural: it under-predicts primacy magnitude on Exp1/2/11 (its rho \u2264 0.30 'small-to-moderate share' cap is too conservative) and slightly over-commits on Exp6 (0.906 vs 0.843) and Exp12 (-0.223 vs -0.173). Conclusion: IVC is degenerate \u2014 its defining prediction (position-invariant weights) is rejected by at least four independent experiments. Rather than merely retuning PW-IVC, the more productive move per the arbitration protocol is to replace the degenerate IVC with a brand-new theory that is a STRONGER competitor to PW-IVC: one that keeps the shared distrust-inversion core (which both theories need for Exps 3/5/7/9) but builds in a larger, multiplicatively interacting primacy component that can actually reach the observed primacy magnitudes (slopes 0.31/0.54, recency-following 0.34) that PW-IVC's additive mixture with rho \u2264 0.30 can only undershoot.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace IVC with PRIMACY-GATED DISTRUST TALLYING (PGDT). Core claim: subjects scan experts in presentation order and attention follows a steep convex primacy gate g_j = ((n-j)/(n-1))^eta with eta \u2208 [4, 9] (position 1 carrying ~50-80% of attention mass); the communicated validities are distrust-inverted exactly as in the shared kernel, inv_j = ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z; but the two combine MULTIPLICATIVELY rather than additively: w_j \u221d g_j * [(1-tau)/n + tau*inv_j], normalized. The multiplicative gate is the key difference from PW-IVC: on tied-validity or matched-validity designs the gate scales the flat kernel directly, producing an early-vs-late contrast per unit distrust dominance that is substantially larger than PW-IVC's additive rho \u2264 0.30 share \u2014 targeting the observed Exp1 slope \u2248 0.31, Exp2 slope \u2248 0.54, Exp11 recency-following \u2248 0.34, Exp8 \u2248 0.37, Exp10 \u2248 0.40 \u2014 while on decreasing-validity layouts the distrust kernel retains dominance because the gate multiplies a near-zero inverted weight for high-validity early cues, preserving the anti-validity regression (Exp3 \u2248 0.21, Exp5 \u2248 -0.58, Exp7 \u2248 0.23, Exp9 \u2248 0.79). Choice rule: logistic in beta*d with beta \u2208 [2.5, 9] and a small uniform lapse epsilon \u2208 [0.04, 0.15] (lower than IVC's, since the gate itself supplies response dilution on late-cue trials). Parameter ranges: tau \u2208 [0.80, 0.97], gamma \u2208 [1.5, 3.5], c \u2208 [0.0, 0.25], eta \u2208 [4, 9]. Validation target: the new theory's simulated predictions should land within ~0.05 of all twelve observed metric values, with particular attention to (i) not overshooting Exp12 (-0.173) and Exp6 (0.843) while (ii) reaching the Exp1/Exp2 primacy slopes that PW-IVC currently undershoots \u2014 the multiplicative (rather than additive) validity-by-position interaction is precisely what should dissociate these regimes."
