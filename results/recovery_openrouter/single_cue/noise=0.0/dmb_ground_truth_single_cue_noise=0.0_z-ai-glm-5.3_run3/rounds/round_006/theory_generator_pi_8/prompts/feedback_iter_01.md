# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_6`).

Replace PW-IVC with POSITION-RECOVERED DISTRUST TALLYING (PRDT). Core mechanism, differing from both current theories in one targeted way: (1) Keep the distrust-inversion kernel exactly as in the shared kernel: inv_j ∝ ((1-v_j) - c·min_k(1-v_k))^γ / Z, with γ ∈ [2, 5], c ∈ [0, 0.3]. (2) Replace the CONSTANT trust floor (1-tau)/n with a POSITION-GROWING trust residue: t_j = t0 + (t1 - t0)·(j/(n-1))^κ, with t0 ∈ [0.0, 0.15], t1 ∈ [0.30, 1.00], κ ∈ [1, 4]. Interpretation: subjects anchor in total skepticism toward early-communicated high-validity claims (so a position-1 95% expert is worth almost nothing — driving Exp 2's rescue rate down from 0.43 toward the observed 0.13) but progressively concede credibility to high-validity experts as they appear later (so a position-7 0.90 expert regains enough weight to lift Exp 10's final-expert following from ~0.28 toward the observed ~0.40, and Exp 8's recency-consistency from 0.30 toward 0.37). (3) Combine MULTIPLICATIVELY (the architecture validated by Exp 1): w_j ∝ g_j · [t_j·(1-tau)/n + tau·inv_j], with the floored convex primacy gate g_j = delta + (1-delta)·((n-j)/(n-1))^eta, delta ∈ [0.15, 0.45], eta ∈ [3.5, 7], tau ∈ [0.90, 0.97]. (4) De-attenuate commitment: beta ∈ [3.5, 10], epsilon ∈ [0.04, 0.12], to close the systematic magnitude under-shoot on Exp 1 (1.19 → toward 1.84), Exp 5 (-0.44 → toward -0.58), and the Exp 13/14 primacy slopes (0.23/0.47 → toward 0.31/0.54). Evidence integration stays additive over discriminating cues, d = Σ w_j·sign(A_j - B_j), with logistic choice in beta·d. Why this beats both incumbents: on Exp 1 it reproduces PGDT's sign-guaranteed validity-amplified crossover at larger magnitude (the growing trust residue further steepens the low-vs-high duel contrast); on Exp 2 it drives the position-1 trusted expert's effective weight toward zero, reaching rescue rates PGDT's box cannot; on Exp 10/8 it is the only architecture whose trusted-expert weight rises with position; on Exps 7, 9, 11, 12 it inherits the validated anti-validity and primacy-gate signatures. The single new degree of freedom (the t0→t1 trust-recovery ramp) is pinned by two independent joint failures of the incumbent theories, so it is not free curve-fitting — it is the minimal structural repair demanded by the pooled data.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
POSITION-RECOVERED DISTRUST TALLYING (PRDT), calibration-pass edition. Subjects scan expert ratings in presentation order through a floored convex primacy gate g_j = delta + (1-delta)*((n-j)/(n-1))^eta. Communicated validities are distrust-inverted (subjects act as if stated validity were the expert's error rate): inv_j = ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z. Trust itself recovers with position: t_j = t0 + (t1-t0)*(j/(n-1))^kappa, with t0 pinned at ~0 — total skepticism toward early-communicated high-validity claims — ramping to a strong late-position residue. Weights combine multiplicatively: w_j ∝ g_j * [t_j*(1-tau)/n + tau*inv_j]; evidence d = Σ w_j*sign(A_j - B_j); choice is logistic in beta*d with uniform lapse epsilon. This iteration keeps the accepted architecture exactly and re-calibrates only: softer commitment (beta in the lower half of its box, epsilon in the upper half), a stronger delayed trust ramp (t1 up to 1.0, t0 ~ 0, kappa 2-4), a softer gate (eta 3.5-4.5, delta 0.35-0.45) so late positions are not crushed, and slightly reduced distrust dominance (tau 0.90-0.93, gamma 2.0-3.5) to soften the anti-validity over-shoots without breaking the early-trusted-expert suppression carried by t0≈0.

    # Architecture UNCHANGED from the accepted iter-1 base (distrust
    # inversion + position-growing trust residue + floored primacy gate,
    # multiplicative combination, additive integration, logistic choice).
    # Only the parameter RANGES are re-calibrated:
    #   (1) DE-ESCALATE COMMITMENT: beta moved from [3.5, 10] to
    #       [3.5, 5.5] (lower half of the box) and epsilon from
    #       [0.04, 0.12] to [0.08, 0.12] (upper half). The iter-1
    #       over-execution of the de-attenuation made choices too
    #       deterministic, amplifying every weight imbalance to near-1/0
    #       (Exps 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 all over-shot in the distrust /
    #       anti-validity direction). Softer commitment pulls those back
    #       toward their observed values, and simultaneously moves Exps
    #       5/6/8/9 (all between the iter-1 simulation and 0.5) toward
    #       their targets.
    #   (2) STRENGTHEN THE TRUST-RECOVERY RAMP: t1 raised to [0.70, 1.00],
    #       t0 pinned to [0.0, 0.02] (~exactly zero: the position-1
    #       trusted expert's bracket must vanish so the Exp 14 rescue
    #       rate falls from 0.26 toward 0.13), kappa kept in [2, 4] so
       #       trust recovery stays delayed.
    #   (3) SOFTEN THE GATE so g_j's decay stops crushing the late
       #       positions that t_j is trying to rescue: eta narrowed to
    #       [3.5, 4.5], delta raised to [0.35, 0.45].
    #   (4) REDUCE DISTRUST DOMINANCE slightly: tau narrowed to
    #       [0.90, 0.93], gamma to [2.0, 3.5], softening the anti-validity
    #       over-shoots (Exps 3, 7, 10) without touching the Exp 14
    #       suppression (carried by t0 ~ 0, not by gamma).

`rationale`:
This is the calibration pass the critic explicitly requested — the PRDT architecture is kept byte-for-byte identical to the accepted iter-1 base and only the parameter ranges are re-tuned, because every pooled residual was diagnosed as a monotone, in-box parameter away from its target. (A) Over-commitment fix: the iter-1 de-attenuation (beta up to 10, epsilon down to 0.04) over-executed the arbiter's prescription, making choices too deterministic and amplifying every weight imbalance to near-1/0 — the source of the distrust-direction over-shoots on Exps 1 (0.065 vs 0.208), 2 (0.375 vs 0.158), 3 (-0.82 vs -0.58), 4 (0.92 vs 0.84), 7 (0.90 vs 0.79) and 10 (-0.31 vs -0.17). Moving beta to [3.5, 5.5] and epsilon to [0.08, 0.12] softens determinism, which pulls all six back toward their observed values, and — because the observed values on Exps 5 (0.23), 6 (0.37), 8 (0.40) and 9 (0.34) all lie between the iter-1 simulation and 0.5 — the same softening simultaneously lifts the under-shot recency metrics. (B) Trust-ramp strengthening: the iter-1 fit let the multiplicative gate g_j decay with position faster than t_j rose, so late trusted experts were still crushed — Exp 8 fell to 0.246 vs the observed 0.396. Raising t1 to [0.70, 1.00], pinning t0 at ~0 (so the position-1 trusted expert's bracket vanishes completely, pushing Exp 14's rescue rate from 0.26 toward 0.13), keeping kappa in [2, 4] for delayed recovery, and softening the gate (eta to [3.5, 4.5], delta to [0.35, 0.45]) lets the late-position trusted channel actually regain weight. (C) Distrust-dominance trim: tau to [0.90, 0.93] and gamma to [2.0, 3.5] soften the anti-validity over-shoots on Exps 3, 7 and 10 without touching the Exp 14 suppression, which is carried by t0 ≈ 0 rather than by gamma. No kernel, no combination rule, no integration rule was altered: the sign-guaranteed validity-amplified crossover (Exp 13, 1.96 vs observed 1.84) and the early-trusted rescue suppression (Exp 14) — the two structural successes that got iter-1 accepted — are preserved by construction, while every remaining residual is addressed by a monotone in-box adjustment.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1754 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1630 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1630.

**Metric**

    # With all six validities equal (0.95), IVC's weight vector is EXACTLY
    # flat for every admissible parameter combination (the distrust kernel
    # is constant across features, so w_j = 1/n identically). Hence on any
    # trial where the two options win an equal number of discriminating
    # cues (count difference = 0), IVC's evidence d = 0 and P(choose A) =
    # 0.50 exactly -- the lapse preserves 0.5. This is parameter-free.
    #
    # SWC, in contrast, has strictly increasing weights in cue position
    # (lambda >= 0.8, rho >= 0.8, convex recency), and on count-neutral
    # trials its evidence reduces EXACTLY to d = lambda*rho*sum_j pos_j*s_j,
    # so it must prefer the option supported by the LATER cues, with
    # subject-level choice rates roughly in [0.60, 0.79].
    #
    # The metric: among count-neutral trials, the fraction of choices that
    # go to the option favored by the later (more recent) discriminating

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """
    Primacy-slope metric on validity-matched cells (with X2-family
    orientation absorbed by a dummy).

    Logic: on every trial where the two options' winning-cue validity
    multisets are IDENTICAL (the 20 matched cells: D0,Z1,D1,W1,W2,D2,
    D2b,D3,D4,D5 + mirrors), the distrust kernel and the flat counting
    kernel cancel EXACTLY, so IVC predicts P(A)=0.500 parameter-free
    (the lapse preserves 0.5). PW-IVC predicts a systematic deviation
    graded by the primacy contrast C = w_prim . sign(A-B), with a
    steep convex reference gradient (eta=5).

    We also include the six X2-family cells (2 wins per side, unequal
    validity multisets). Under IVC all X2 cells share ONE probability
    that depends only on orientation (A-won-the-0.9 vs mirror), so a
    single +-1 orientation dummy Z absorbs IVC's entire mean structure
    there; the within-family position spread then loads on C.

    Metric = OLS coefficient of C in y ~ 1 + C + Z, with y = +1 (chose
    A) / -1 (chose B). Under IVC this coefficient is EXACTLY 0 in
    expectation for every admissible parameter. Under PW-IVC it is
    strictly positive (roughly 2*(1-eps)*beta*tau*rho scale), typically
    0.15-0.8.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: PRDT is a genuine structural success on the two joint failures that motivated it: Exp 13 (validity-amplified crossover composite) jumps from pi_7's 1.19 to 1.96 against an observed 1.84, and Exp 14 (early-trusted-expert rescue) drops from 0.43 to 0.26 against an observed 0.13 — by far the best of any theory on both. The gate correctly accepted it (loss 0.1754). However, the pooled residuals show two systematic, opposite-signed calibration errors. (A) OVER-COMMITMENT / over-dominant distrust channel: Exp 1 (0.065 vs 0.208, far too anti-TTB), Exp 2 (0.375 vs 0.158, too tally-aligned), Exp 3 (-0.82 vs -0.58, anti-validity slope too steep), Exp 4 (0.92 vs 0.84), Exp 7 (0.90 vs 0.79), Exp 10 (-0.31 vs -0.17) all over-shoot in the distrust/anti-validity direction. The arbiter's 'de-attenuation' prescription (beta up to 10) was over-executed: choices are too deterministic, amplifying every weight imbalance to near-1/0. (B) The trust-recovery ramp UNDER-delivered on recency: Exp 8 final-expert following actually FELL to 0.246 (vs pi_7's 0.283, observed 0.396), and Exps 5 (0.08 vs 0.23), 6 (0.26 vs 0.37), 9 (0.26 vs 0.34) all under-shoot. Mechanistically, the multiplicative primacy gate g_j decays faster with position than the trust ramp t_j rises, so the product still crushes late-cue weight — the fitted t1/kappa combination is too weak (and/or eta too steep, delta too low) to let a late trusted expert regain weight. Note that many of the (B) failures would also be partially corrected simply by reducing determinism, since observed values on Exps 5/6/8/9 all lie between the candidate's value and 0.5. The architecture is right; the calibration is not.
Rationale: Keep the PRDT architecture exactly as prescribed (distrust-inversion kernel, position-growing trust residue, multiplicative floored primacy gate, additive integration, logistic choice) — it is the first candidate to simultaneously produce the Exp 13 crossover magnitude and the Exp 14 rescue suppression. But it was accepted with systematic residuals, so keep tuning on this base with in-family parameter adjustments only: (1) DE-ESCALATE the de-attenuation: move beta to the lower half of its box (≈3.5–5.5) and epsilon to the upper half (≈0.08–0.12). This alone pulls Exp 1 up toward 0.21, Exp 2 down toward 0.16, Exp 3 up toward -0.58, Exp 7 down toward 0.79, Exp 10 toward -0.17, and Exp 4 toward 0.84, and moves Exps 5/6/8/9 toward their observed values (all between the current simulation and 0.5). (2) STRENGTHEN the trust-recovery ramp so late trusted experts actually regain weight: push t1 to 0.7–1.0, keep t0 pinned at exactly 0.0 (Exp 14 is still 2x the observed rescue rate; the position-1 trusted expert's bracket must vanish completely), and keep kappa in 2–4 so trust stays delayed. If Exp 8 remains under-shot after the beta correction, soften the gate: eta toward 3.5–4.5 and delta toward 0.35–0.45, so g_j's floor stops crushing the late positions that t_j is trying to rescue. (3) Slightly reduce distrust dominance: tau toward 0.90–0.93 and gamma toward 2–3.5 to soften the anti-validity over-shoots (Exps 3, 7, 10) without breaking the Exp 14 suppression (which is carried by t0≈0, not by gamma). Do NOT restructure the kernel or switch families — every residual is a monotone, in-box parameter away from the observed value, so this is a calibration pass, not a redesign.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1754 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1630 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

{
  "interpretation": "The iter-2 calibration pass was a net gain (loss 0.1754 -> 0.1630, accepted) and my iter-1 diagnosis was partially validated: softening commitment and trimming distrust dominance improved ten experiments, several substantially (Exp 9 is now essentially perfect at 0.349 vs 0.341; Exps 5, 6, 10 nearly closed). However, the pass over-corrected and gave away exactly the two signature phenomena that justified PRDT over the incumbents in the first place. Exp 13 (validity-amplified crossover) fell from 1.96 to 1.236 \u2014 statistically indistinguishable from pi_7's 1.19, i.e. the candidate no longer beats the incumbent the arbiter wanted to replace. Exp 14 (early-trusted-expert rescue) ROSE from 0.257 to 0.409 against an observed 0.132 \u2014 again no better than pi_7's 0.431. The primacy slopes also collapsed: Exp 11 (0.247 -> 0.165 vs observed 0.315), Exp 12 (0.619 -> 0.354 vs observed 0.540). Diagnosis of the mechanism: (a) the beta reduction to [3.5, 5.5] shrank every slope-like metric (11, 12, 13) toward zero; (b) the gate softening (eta 3.5-4.5, delta 0.35-0.45) was the wrong lever \u2014 it bought only +0.023 on Exp 8 (0.246 -> 0.270, still 0.13 under observed) while directly sabotaging Exps 13/14/11/12. The Exp 14 failure is instructive: in that design the rescue option's supporting cues are LOW-validity (0.50) experts at late positions, so they carry large distrust-inverted weight, and the softened gate (plus the stronger t1 ramp) let them regain exactly that weight. The only discriminator between the opposing early 0.50 expert and the rescue option's late 0.50 helpers is gate steepness \u2014 so the steep gate IS the Exp 14 mechanism, and flattening it destroys the rescue suppression. Meanwhile Exp 8's residual under-shot is capped structurally: the final expert's trust channel is bounded by (1-tau)/n \u2248 0.017 at tau >= 0.90, so gate-flattening was never going to close it anyway. The tau/gamma trim (Exps 3, 7, 10 all improved) is the part of iter 2 that worked and should be kept; the beta/gate/delta changes are the parts that broke the primacy family.",
