# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_8`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_8`).

Replace pi_8 (PRDT) with a new theory — POSITION-BRIDGED DISTRUST TALLYING (PBDT) — that keeps pi_7 as the incumbent competitor and is designed to beat it on the experiments where it is currently weak (15, 16, 13, 14) while matching it on 1, 2, 7. Architecture: (1) keep the shared, well-validated kernel: distrust inversion of stated validities with partial centering, inv_j = ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z, but with gamma in [2.0, 2.9] — bridging the two theories' disjoint boxes [1.6,2.2] and [2.8,3.5], since Exp 1's observed contrast fell between predictions and Exp 2's ladder data sat below PGDT's steep-kernel corner predictions. (2) keep the floored convex primacy gate g_j = delta + (1-delta)*((n-j)/(n-1))^eta but make it STEEPER than either current theory: eta in [5.5, 8.0], delta in [0.12, 0.30]. This is the single most systematic residual in the pooled data: Experiments 8, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 all show observed values on the more-primacy side of BOTH theories' predictions (e.g., Exp 16's 13% trusted-early following vs 0.31/0.43 predicted is achievable when one early distrusted cue outweighs 2-3 later distrusted cues; Exp 13's primacy slope 0.315 vs 0.232/0.254; Exp 14's 0.540 vs 0.468/0.577). (3) replace PRDT's t0-pinned-at-zero trust ramp with a MODERATE ramp: t_j = t0 + (t1-t0)*(j/(n-1))^kappa with t0 in [0.25, 0.55] (early trusted experts retain real weight — this is what the Exp 1/2 data demand and what killed PRDT), t1 in [0.80, 1.00], kappa in [1.0, 2.5]. This preserves late-trusted recovery (Exp 15's H-family anti-primacy among 95% experts, Exp 10's final-expert overweight) without annihilating the early flat share. (4) weights combine multiplicatively as in both parents: w_j proportional to g_j * [t_j*(1-tau)/n + tau*inv_j], with tau in [0.86, 0.93] so the flat share is small enough that a steeply-gated early trusted expert cannot reach the 0.3-0.4 following rates both theories wrongly predicted on Exp 16. (5) increase response noise to fix the joint Exp 4 overshoot: beta in [3.0, 5.0], epsilon in [0.10, 0.16], so tally-vs-TTB conflict choices sit nearer the observed mild 0.158 allegiance rather than the 0.30-0.40 both theories produce. Integration and choice rule unchanged (additive d = sum_j w_j*sign(A_j - B_j), logistic in beta*d, uniform lapse). The theory's claim: the anti-validity signature is real and moderate-to-steep (bridged gamma), position structure is dominated by a steeper-than-assumed primacy gate over DISTRAUSTED cues, and trust in high-validity experts recovers with position but from a nonzero floor — a synthesis positioned to capture the experiments each parent currently wins.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.803)

**Description**
PRIMACY-GATED DISTRUST TALLYING (PGDT), floored-gate edition with a rebalanced distrust share. Subjects scan the expert ratings in presentation order and attention is deployed through a steep convex primacy gate with a substantial nonzero floor: g_j = delta + (1-delta)*((n-j)/(n-1))^eta, so the first one or two experts carry the dominant share of attention but late experts retain a meaningful attention residue. Independently, the communicated validities are distrust-inverted exactly as in the shared kernel: subjects act as if each stated validity were the expert's error rate, inv_j = ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z. The two kernels combine MULTIPLICATIVELY: w_j proportional to g_j * [(1-tau)/n + tau*inv_j], normalized. The refinement this iteration is a rebalanced distrust share: tau is lowered to [0.82, 0.92] so the flat component (1-tau)/n of the multiplicative bracket grows from ~1.5% to ~4-5% per cue. This directly feeds trusted high-validity LATE experts (whose bracket value is structurally pinned at the flat share regardless of gate shape), softens the distrust-driven allegiance contrasts that overshoot their targets, and pulls the effective weights off pure anti-validity where that overshoots. A modestly raised gate floor delta in [0.20, 0.45] compensates on decreasing-validity layouts by further concentrating the product weights onto the back-loaded low-validity experts, protecting the anti-validity regression. Evidence is integrated additively over all discriminating cues, d = sum_j w_j * sign(A_j - B_j), and choice is logistic in beta*d with a small uniform lapse epsilon.

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.766)

**Description**
POSITION-RECOVERED DISTRUST TALLYING (PRDT), flattened-inversion edition. Subjects scan the expert ratings in presentation order through a steep floored convex primacy gate g_j = delta + (1-delta)*((n-j)/(n-1))^eta, so the first one or two experts carry the dominant share of attention while late experts retain a floor residue. The communicated validities are distrust-inverted — subjects act as if each stated validity were the expert's error rate — but the inversion kernel is now comparatively FLAT: inv_j = ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z with gamma in [1.6, 2.2], so low-validity experts dominate only moderately rather than monopolizing the weight mass. Trust itself recovers with presentation position: t_j = t0 + (t1-t0)*(j/(n-1))^kappa with t0 pinned at exactly zero — total skepticism toward early-communicated high-validity claims — ramping to a strong late-position residue with low convexity so credibility returns across the mid-late positions. Weights combine multiplicatively: w_j proportional to g_j * [t_j*(1-tau)/n + tau*inv_j]; evidence d = sum_j w_j*sign(A_j - B_j) is integrated additively over discriminating cues; choice is logistic in beta*d with a uniform lapse epsilon. The theoretical claim: the anti-validity signature in human data is a MODERATE distrust gradient, not a steep one — the steep primacy gate supplies the position structure while a flattened distrust kernel lets early high-validity cues retain enough weight to produce the mild TTB-following, weak tally-allegiance, and moderate validity-adherence observed across the pooled experiments.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.614)

**Description**
PRIMACY-WEIGHTED INVERTED-VALIDITY COUNTING (PW-IVC). Subjects read the communicated validities but systematically distrust-invert them: they act as if each stated validity were the expert's error rate, so highly validated experts are discounted most (the anti-validity signature). Independently and additively, subjective attention is tilted toward EARLY-presented cues by a steep convex primacy gradient concentrated on the first one or two positions, at a small-to-moderate share of the subjective-weight mixture so the distrust kernel retains dominance wherever validity information varies. Each cue j carries weight w_j = (1-tau)/n + tau * [ (1-rho) * ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z_v + rho * ((n-j)/(n-1))^eta / Z_p ]; evidence d = sum_j w_j * sign(A_j - B_j) is integrated additively over all discriminating cues; choice is logistic in beta*d with a small uniform lapse epsilon. On tied-validity designs the distrust kernel is exactly flat and the primacy kernel alone supplies the early-vs-late contrast, producing below-chance recency-following; on decreasing-validity layouts the distrust kernel dominates and reproduces the anti-validity regression signature.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1120 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1120 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

    # With all six validities equal (0.95), IVC's weight vector is EXACTLY
    # flat for every admissible parameter combination (the distrust kernel
    # is constant across features, so w_j = 1/n identically). Hence on any
    # trial where the two options win an equal number of discriminating
    # cues (count difference = 0), IVC's evidence d = 0 and P(choose A) =
    # 0.50 exactly -- the lapse preserves 0.5. This is parameter-free.
    #
    # SWC, in contrast, has strictly increasing weights in cue position
    # (lambda >= 0.8, rho >= 0.8, convex recency), and on count-neutral
    # trials its evidence reduces EXACTLY to d = lambda*rho*sum_j pos_j*s_j,
    # so it must prefer the option supported by the LATER cues, with
    # subject-level choice rates roughly in [0.60, 0.79].
    #
    # The metric: among count-neutral trials, the fraction of choices that
    # go to the option favored by the later (more recent) discriminating

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """
    Primacy-slope metric on validity-matched cells (with X2-family
    orientation absorbed by a dummy).

    Logic: on every trial where the two options' winning-cue validity
    multisets are IDENTICAL (the 20 matched cells: D0,Z1,D1,W1,W2,D2,
    D2b,D3,D4,D5 + mirrors), the distrust kernel and the flat counting
    kernel cancel EXACTLY, so IVC predicts P(A)=0.500 parameter-free
    (the lapse preserves 0.5). PW-IVC predicts a systematic deviation
    graded by the primacy contrast C = w_prim . sign(A-B), with a
    steep convex reference gradient (eta=5).

    We also include the six X2-family cells (2 wins per side, unequal
    validity multisets). Under IVC all X2 cells share ONE probability
    that depends only on orientation (A-won-the-0.9 vs mirror), so a
    single +-1 orientation dummy Z absorbs IVC's entire mean structure
    there; the within-family position spread then loads on C.

    Metric = OLS coefficient of C in y ~ 1 + C + Z, with y = +1 (chose
    A) / -1 (chose B). Under IVC this coefficient is EXACTLY 0 in
    expectation for every admissible parameter. Under PW-IVC it is
    strictly positive (roughly 2*(1-eps)*beta*tau*rho scale), typically
    0.15-0.8.

**Metric**
```python

def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    # Two-stage, layout-adaptive theory discriminant.
    # Stage 1 infers which validity layout generated the data (the design
    # header lists [0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75] while
    # the rationale/trial list is built around a 0.55 expert at position
    # 5). The inference uses only the clean two-cue duels involving
    # position 5: under the 0.55 layout BOTH theories prefer the
    # position-5-endorsed product with P ~ 0.7-0.9; under the all-0.75
    # layout that probability is ~ 0.5. This is a theory-agnostic,
    # mirror-balanced statistic, so it is safe to branch on.
    # Stage 2 computes a gap-weighted choice discriminant: for every unique
    # (A, B) rating pattern it evaluates the box-averaged predicted P(A)
    # of PRDT (distrust inversion with gamma in [1.6, 2.2], floored primacy
    # gate, position-growing trust ramp with t0 pinned at 0) and of PGDT
    # (gamma in [2.8, 3.5], position-independent flat share (1-tau)/8),
    # using each theory's own mechanics verbatim, and weights the observed
    # choose-A indicator by the signed predicted gap. Mirrored cells
    # automatically reinforce. The score is linear in the trial outcomes,
    # so the pooled value equals the mean of the per-subject values and
    # the metric works on single-subject slices.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
POSITION-BRIDGED DISTRUST TALLYING (PBDT). Subjects scan the expert ratings in presentation order and deploy attention through a steep floored convex primacy gate, g_j = delta + (1-delta)*((n-j)/(n-1))^eta, with eta steeper than any prior distrust-tallying variant (5.5-8.0) so that one early cue can outweigh two or three later ones. Independently, the communicated validities are distrust-inverted — subjects act as if each stated validity were the expert's error rate — through a MODERATE-TO-STEEP bridged kernel inv_j = ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z with gamma in [2.0, 2.9], bridging the two parent theories' disjoint gamma boxes because the pooled data (Exp 1's observed contrast between the parents' predictions, Exp 2's ladder values below the steep-kernel corner) sit between them. Trust in high-validity experts is neither absent (which killed PRDT on Exp 1/2) nor position-invariant (which over-followed early trusted experts on Exp 14/16): it ramps with position from a SUBSTANTIAL NONZERO FLOOR, t_j = t0 + (t1-t0)*(j/(n-1))^kappa with t0 in [0.25, 0.55], t1 in [0.80, 1.00], kappa in [1.0, 2.5] — early trusted experts retain real weight while late trusted experts recover nearly fully, preserving Exp 15's H-family anti-primacy among 95% experts and Exp 8's late-expert structure. Weights combine multiplicatively, w_j proportional to g_j * [t_j*(1-tau)/n + tau*inv_j], with tau in [0.86, 0.93] so the flat share stays small enough that a steeply-gated early trusted expert cannot reach the 0.3-0.4 following rates both parents wrongly predicted on Exp 16. Evidence is integrated additively over all discriminating cues, d = sum_j w_j*sign(A_j - B_j); choice is logistic in beta*d (beta in [3.0, 5.0]) with a uniform lapse epsilon in [0.10, 0.16], jointly calibrated so tally-vs-TTB conflict choices sit near the observed mild allegiance rather than the 0.30-0.40 both parents produce. The claim: the anti-validity signature is real and moderate-to-steep; position structure over distrusted cues is dominated by a steeper-than-assumed primacy gate; and trust in high-validity experts recovers with position but from a nonzero floor.

    # Synthesis of the two parent theories (PGDT / PRDT), built per the
    # arbiter's directive to beat pi_7 on Exps 15, 16, 13, 14 while matching
    # it on 1, 2, 7:
    #   (1) BRIDGED GAMMA [2.0, 2.9]: spans the gap between PRDT's flat
    #       kernel [1.6, 2.2] and PGDT's steep kernel [2.8, 3.5]. Exp 1's
    #       observed contrast fell between the parents' predictions and
    #       Exp 2's ladder data sat below the steep-kernel corner, so the
    #       data demand an intermediate distrust steepness.
    #   (2) STEEPER PRIMACY GATE: eta in [5.5, 8.0] (steeper than either
    #       parent), delta in [0.12, 0.30]. The single most systematic
    #       residual in the pooled data is under-primacy: Exps 8, 10, 11,
    #       13, 14, 16 all sit on the more-primacy side of BOTH parents.
    #       A steeper gate lets one early distrusted cue outweigh 2-3
    #       later distrusted cues (Exp 16's 13% trusted-early following,
    #       Exp 13's steeper primacy slope, Exp 14's low rescue rate).
    #   (3) MODERATE TRUST RAMP: t0 in [0.25, 0.55] -- NOT pinned at zero
    #       (which killed PRDT on Exp 1/2: early trusted experts must
    #       retain real weight) -- ramping to t1 in [0.80, 1.00] with
    #       kappa in [1.0, 2.5]. Preserves late-trusted recovery (Exp 15's
    #       H-family anti-primacy among 95% experts, Exp 10's final-expert
    #       overweight) without annihilating the early flat share.

`rationale`: PBDT is a directed synthesis of the two parent theories, each of whose failures are well-localized and complementary. (1) Gamma bridging: PGDT (gamma 2.8-3.5) over-commits distrust on Exps 1/2 (Exp 2: 0.300 vs real 0.158) while PRDT (gamma 1.6-2.2) under-commits on the same axis from the other side (Exp 2: 0.403) — the observed contrasts sit between the parents' boxes, so gamma in [2.0, 2.9] spans the region neither parent could reach. (2) Steeper primacy gate: the single most systematic residual across the pooled data is UNDER-primacy — Exps 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16 all show observed values on the more-primacy side of both parents' predictions (Exp 13 slope 0.315 vs 0.232/0.254; Exp 14's 0.540 vs 0.468/0.577; Exp 16's 13% trusted-early following vs 0.31/0.43). Raising eta to [5.5, 8.0] — steeper than either parent — lets one early distrusted cue outweigh 2-3 later distrusted cues, while the lowered delta floor [0.12, 0.30] prevents late low-validity cues from being crushed, protecting the anti-validity regressions (Exp 3, 5, 7). (3) Moderate trust ramp: PRDT's t0=0 pinning was falsified on Exps 1/2 (early trusted experts must retain real weight: pi_8's Exp 1 = 0.109 vs real 0.208), while PGDT's position-independent flat share over-follows early trusted experts on Exp 14 (0.431 vs real 0.132) and Exp 16. The moderate ramp t0 in [0.25, 0.55] ramping to t1 in [0.80, 1.00] keeps early trusted weight nonzero but small, and preserves late-trusted recovery (Exp 15's H-family anti-primacy among 95% experts, where pi_7 overshoots at 1.201 vs real 1.036 and pi_8 undershoots at 0.771; Exp 8's final-expert structure). (4) tau in [0.86, 0.93] caps the trusted channel so the steep gate cannot push an early trusted expert to the 0.3-0.4 following rates both parents wrongly produced on Exp 16. (5) The joint response-noise recalibration (beta [3.0, 5.0], epsilon [0.10, 0.16]) directly targets the shared Exp 4 over-determinism (both parents ~0.89-0.91 vs real 0.843) and the over-committed conflict allegiances. Every knob is moved in the direction the residuals of BOTH parents indicate, and the multiplicative architecture — the best-validated component of the family — is preserved unchanged, so the theory should improve on the parents' weak experiments without sacrificing their strong ones.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: PBDT is a genuine improvement over both parents and was rightly accepted by the gate (loss 0.1120). It delivers on several of the arbiter's targeted experiments: Exp 16 is essentially perfect (0.3211 vs 0.3217, where pi_7 undershot at 0.292 and pi_8 overshot at 0.499), Exp 13 jumps from pi_7's 1.19 to 1.58 (real 1.84), Exp 12 improves to 0.5695 (real 0.5396), Exp 15 lands at 0.9752 (real 1.0358, closer than pi_7's 1.2013), and Exp 1 improves to 0.1897 (real 0.2080) versus pi_7's 0.1637 / pi_8's 0.1093. The bridged gamma and nonzero trust floor clearly worked as intended there. However, four systematic residuals remain, and they are coherent enough to guide a tuning pass rather than a redesign: (1) Exp 2 tally-vs-TTB contrast is 0.3088 vs real 0.1583 — essentially unchanged from pi_7's 0.2996, so the joint noise recalibration (beta 3-5, eps 0.10-0.16) did not bite; the fitted response function is still too deterministic on conflict trials (also visible in Exp 4: 0.8925 vs 0.8433, and Exp 7: 0.8522 vs 0.7878). (2) Exp 3's anti-validity partial coefficient is only -0.2651 vs real -0.5756, with between-subject variance more than double the real data (0.042 vs 0.019) — worse than either parent (pi_7 -0.438, pi_8 -0.484). Diagnosis: in Exp 3 validities are strictly decreasing in position, so the steep primacy gate boosts exactly the high-validity (low distrust) cues and cancels the anti-validity gradient; the gate is too steep / the distrust channel too weak in this confounded layout. (3) Exp 14 trusted-early following is 0.3122 vs real 0.1322 — better than pi_7's 0.431 but still 2.4x the observed rate; the position-1 95% expert retains too much weight via the t0 floor times the flat share. (4) Exp 8 final-expert following is 0.2700 vs real 0.3957 — the late 0.90-validity expert gets zero distrust weight after centering (its error rate IS the minimum, so centered=0) and only the tiny t*(1-tau)/n channel, so it is still over-crushed. All four residuals point in compatible in-family directions.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED and becomes the new base, so this regenerate verdict means 'keep tuning this base', not 'discard it'. The residuals are coherent and fixable with parameter re-balancing inside the prescribed PBDT family, no architectural change: (a) SHARPEN THE TRUST-RAMP CONTRAST — lower t0 to [0.25, 0.35], raise t1 to [0.95, 1.00], and lower kappa to [1.0, 1.5]. This simultaneously attacks Exp 14 (less early-trusted weight → following drops from 0.31 toward 0.13) and Exp 8 (late trusted experts recover more of the flat share → FEDI rises from 0.27 toward 0.40); the ramp's position dependence is exactly the knob that lets both move at once. (b) STRENGTHEN THE DISTRUST CHANNEL where position and validity are confounded: gamma toward the upper end [2.6, 2.9] and tau toward [0.91, 0.93], with eta at the LOWER end [5.5, 6.0] and delta at the upper end [0.25, 0.30] so late low-validity cues are not crushed by the gate — this targets Exp 3 (coefficient from -0.265 toward -0.576, and reduce the excessive var=0.042) and Exp 13 (1.58 toward 1.84) without giving up Exp 16, where the current fit is nearly exact and should be monitored as a constraint. (c) REDUCE RESPONSE DETERMINISM: beta to [3.0, 3.8] and epsilon to [0.13, 0.16]; the previous noise recalibration failed because the fitted beta evidently sat high — the Exp 2 contrast (0.309 vs 0.158), Exp 4 anchors (0.893 vs 0.843) and Exp 7 (0.852 vs 0.788) all shrink toward the data with a flatter logistic, and the lapse mechanically attenuates every contrast metric. Watch Exp 1 (currently good at 0.190 vs 0.208) and Exp 12 (0.570 vs 0.540) for over-correction: if lowering beta pushes those past the data, split the difference on beta (~3.5-4.0) and lean more on epsilon. These three moves are mutually reinforcing except for a mild tension between tau-up (helps Exps 3/13/14) and the flat share that Exp 8 needs — resolve it via the t1/kappa end of the ramp rather than lowering tau.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1120 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

Subjects scan expert ratings in presentation order through a steep floored convex primacy gate g_j = delta + (1-delta)*((n-j)/(n-1))^eta.

Trust in high-validity experts ramps with position from a small-but-nonzero floor: t_j = t0 + (t1-t0)*(j/(n-1))^kappa, with a SHARPENED ramp contrast (low t0, high t1, low kappa) so early trusted experts retain only a little weight while late trusted experts recover nearly the full flat share. Weights combine multiplicatively, w_j proportional to g_j * [t_j*(1-tau)/n + tau*inv_j], with the distrust share tau high so the anti-validity channel dominates in validity-position-confounded layouts.

(a) Sharpened trust ramp: t0 [0.25,0.55]->[0.25,0.35], t1 [0.80,1.00]->[0.95,1.00], kappa [1.0,2.5]->[1.0,1.5]. The ramp's position dependence is the one knob that simultaneously lowers Exp 14's trusted-early following (0.312 -> toward 0.132, less early-trusted weight) and raises Exp 8's final-expert FEDI (0.270 -> toward 0.396, late trusted experts recover nearly the full flat share). (b) Stronger distrust channel in confounded layouts: gamma ->[2.6,2.9], tau ->[0.91,0.93], eta lowered to [5.5,6.0] and delta raised to [0.25,0.30]. In Exp 3 validities decrease with position, so iter-1's very steep low-floor gate boosted exactly the high-validity cues and cancelled the anti-validity gradient (coefficient -0.265 vs real -0.576, var 0.042 vs 0.019). Steeper distrust plus a less gate-crushed late tail restores that regression and should also push Exp 13 from 1.58 toward 1.84. The tau-up/flat-share tension for Exp 8 is resolved through the t1/kappa end of the ramp, per the critic's explicit instruction. (c) Reduced response determinism: epsilon raised to [0.13,0.16] and beta lowered, but because the critic flagged Exp 1 (currently good at 0.190 vs 0.208) and Exp 12 (0.570 vs 0.540) as over-correction risks, I take its stated fallback: split the difference on beta ([3.2,4.0] rather than [3.0,3.8]) and lean more on the lapse, which attenuates all contrast metrics (Exp 2's 0.309->toward 0.158, Exp 4's 0.893->toward 0.843, Exp 7's 0.852->toward 0.788) without distorting the near-perfect Exp 16 fit (0.3211 vs 0.3217) as much as a flat beta cut would. No architectural change: the multiplicative gate-times-bracket kernel, additive integration, and logistic-lapse choice rule are preserved verbatim, since they are the components that earned the iter-1 acceptance."
