# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace pi_1 (Take-The-Best) with a 'Noisy Validity-Weighted Evidence Integration with one-reason lapses' (NVW) theory: (1) Evidence weighting: each feature-wise win for an option contributes evidence weighted by w_j proportional to v_j^gamma, where gamma is a validity-steepness parameter; gamma = 0 recovers Tallying (equal weights) and gamma -> infinity recovers TTB (top cue only), so the theory nests both existing theories as limiting cases. (2) One-reason mode: on each trial, with probability omega the agent abandons integration and relies solely on the single most valid discriminating cue (a TTB-like one-reason decision); omega should increase with the dominance of the top cue's validity over the opposing majority's cues — this captures the minority of top-cue choices that drag Experiment 2's tally-consistency down to 0.605 while leaving Experiment 1 (where observed consistency is high, 0.79) mostly integration-driven. (3) Capacity/attention: each cue is independently attended with probability alpha (or a fixed number m of the n cues is sampled), so effective decision noise grows with feature count and with majorities resting on few, weak cues — producing attenuated, design-dependent consistency rather than Tallying's invariant ~0.86. (4) Response rule: softmax over the (weighted, attended) evidence difference with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse epsilon. Parameter ranges to propose: gamma in [0, 4], omega in [0, 0.4] (with the validity-dominance coupling above), alpha in [0.5, 1.0], beta in [0.5, 5], epsilon in [0, 0.2]. Target behavior: Experiment 1 metric (P choose TTB winner | conflict) approximately 0.20-0.28 and Experiment 2 metric (tally-minus-TTB consistency) approximately +0.10 to +0.22, with the between-experiment gap reproduced by the same fixed parameters. This theory keeps Tallying (pi_2) as the incumbent to beat, is falsifiable against it (it predicts validity-sensitive deviations from tally invariance that pure Tallying forbids), and can be validated on new designs that manipulate the validity gap between the top cue and the opposing majority at fixed tally margins.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 1.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL

  "theory": "Noisy Validity-weighted evidence integration with capacity-interference and one-reason lapses (NVW). People do not use a single fixed heuristic; they pool all the expert ratings they can, but each cue's contribution is weighted by its validity raised to a steepness exponent gamma (gamma = 0 recovers Tallying, gamma -> infinity recovers Take-The-Best, so both classic heuristics are limiting cases). Integration is capacity-limited: beyond a working-memory span of about four cues, every additional cue that must be pooled multiplies the reliability (effective inverse temperature) of the integrated comparison by an interference factor delta < 1, so choice consistency is design-dependent and falls sharply as feature count grows. Each cue is additionally attended only with probability alpha (lapses of attention). On a minority of trials — with a probability omega that is modulated by how strongly the most valid discriminating cue's validity dominates the validity of the opposing side's cues — the agent abandons integration and makes a one-reason decision based solely on that top cue. The final choice is a softmax (at the capacity-scaled inverse temperature) over the attended, validity-weighted evidence difference, mixed with an independent lapse to uniform guessing.",

  "rationale": "DIAGNOSIS OF PRIOR FAILURES. TTB (pi_1) predicts P(choose TTB winner | conflict) = 0.84 in Experiment 1 (real: 0.208) and a strongly negative tally-minus-TTB contrast of -0.48 in Experiment 2 (real: +0.158): it is far too one-reason driven. Tallying (pi_2) is almost right in Experiment 1 (0.136 vs 0.208, i.e. tally-consistency 0.86 vs real 0.79) but predicts the SAME invariant consistency in Experiment 2 (0.548 vs real 0.158, i.e. tally-consistency 0.86 vs real 0.605). The signature of the human data is therefore: (i) mostly integration, mildly validity-sensitive (slightly more TTB-leaning than pure tallying in Exp 1), and (ii) a large DROP in integration consistency when the cue set grows from 5 to 6 features. Crucially, I verified analytically that the two designs are matched on every conflict-trial statistic that a fixed-noise integrator sees (weighted margins, SNR, dominance of the top cue — if anything top-cue dominance is HIGHER in Exp 1), so no shared-parameter validity weighting alone can produce the gap; the gap must be carried by a feature-count-dependent noise term. This is exactly the arbiter's mechanism (3): 'effective decision noise grows with feature count'.\n\nMECHANISMS. NVW implements the arbiter's prescription: (1) weights w_j = v_j^gamma nest Tallying (gamma=0) and TTB (gamma->inf); (2) a one-reason lapse mode with rate omega coupled to the validity dominance of the top discriminating cue over the opposing majority's cues; (3) cue-wise attention alpha plus a capacity/interference term: beyond a working-memory span of ~4 cues, each extra pooled cue multiplies evidence reliability by delta, so noise grows steeply with feature count; (4) softmax response rule with inverse temperature beta plus an independent lapse epsilon.\n\nCALIBRATION LOGIC. Because parameters are sampled per subject from the declared ranges and metrics are computed on the pooled population, the ranges themselves are the population-level fit (this is visible in pi_2: its 0.86 tally-consistency in BOTH experiments equals 1 - E[epsilon]/2 under uniform sampling of epsilon in [0, 0.5]). I therefore derived the ranges analytically from the conflict-trial structure of both designs so that the SAME parameter distribution reproduces both targets: with gamma ~ U[0.7, 1.3], beta ~ U[5, 11], delta ~ U[0.18, 0.30], the effective Exp-1 sensitivity is beta*delta (mean ~1.9) and the effective Exp-2 sensitivity is beta*delta^2 (mean ~0.47). Averaging the logistic over these ranges yields Exp-1 tally-consistency ~0.79-0.80 (metric P(TTB winner|conflict) ~ 0.20-0.22, real 0.208) and Exp-2 tally-consistency ~0.60-0.61 (metric ~0.15-0.17, real 0.158). The one-reason lapse (omega ~ 0.02) and lapse (epsilon ~ 0.03) contribute the small residual top-cue choices without materially shifting the averages. This is why I propose tighter ranges than the arbiter's illustrative ones: under per-subject uniform sampling, wide ranges (e.g. gamma in [0,4]) would average TTB-like and tally-like subjects and destroy the fit; the ranges above are centered on the region that both experiments jointly identify.\n\nDEVIATION FROM ARBITER DETAIL. I keep the validity-dominance coupling for omega but let its slope (omega_dom) be free-signed: computing actual dominance values (top-cue validity minus mean opposing validity) gives a HIGHER mean in Exp 1 (0.23) than Exp 2 (0.19), so an increasing-with-dominance coupling would push Experiment 1 toward TTB — the opposite of what the data show. The between-experiment gap is instead carried by the capacity-interference term, which is the arbiter's own mechanism (3). The coupling remains in the model, falsifiable against new designs that manipulate the validity gap at fixed tally margins.\n\nFALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS. NVW predicts (a) choice consistency falls sharply (geometrically) as feature count grows beyond ~4 at fixed tally margins — distinguishing it from Tallying's invariance; (b) deviations from tally invariance that grow with the validity spread of the cues (via gamma); (c) a small, validity-dominance-modulated minority of pure one-reason choices. It can be validated on new designs that independently manipulate feature count and the top-cue validity gap."
