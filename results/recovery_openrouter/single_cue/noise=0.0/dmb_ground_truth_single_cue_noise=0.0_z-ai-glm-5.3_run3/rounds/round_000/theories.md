# Round 0 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## Replacement

### `pi_3` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Noisy Validity-weighted evidence integration with capacity-interference and one-reason lapses (NVW). People do not use a single fixed heuristic; they pool all the expert ratings they can, but each cue's contribution is weighted by its validity raised to a steepness exponent gamma (gamma = 0 recovers Tallying, gamma -> infinity recovers Take-The-Best, so both classic heuristics are limiting cases). Integration is capacity-limited: beyond a working-memory span of about four cues, every additional cue that must be pooled multiplies the reliability (effective inverse temperature) of the integrated comparison by an interference factor delta < 1, so choice consistency is design-dependent and falls sharply as feature count grows. Each cue is additionally attended only with probability alpha (lapses of attention). On a minority of trials — with a probability omega that is modulated by how strongly the most valid discriminating cue's validity dominates the validity of the opposing side's cues — the agent abandons integration and makes a one-reason decision based solely on that top cue. The final choice is a softmax (at the capacity-scaled inverse temperature) over the attended, validity-weighted evidence difference, mixed with an independent lapse to uniform guessing.

**Rationale:** DIAGNOSIS OF PRIOR FAILURES. TTB (pi_1) predicts P(choose TTB winner | conflict) = 0.84 in Experiment 1 (real: 0.208) and a strongly negative tally-minus-TTB contrast of -0.48 in Experiment 2 (real: +0.158): it is far too one-reason driven. Tallying (pi_2) is almost right in Experiment 1 (0.136 vs 0.208, i.e. tally-consistency 0.86 vs real 0.79) but predicts the SAME invariant consistency in Experiment 2 (0.548 vs real 0.158, i.e. tally-consistency 0.86 vs real 0.605). The signature of the human data is therefore: (i) mostly integration, mildly validity-sensitive (slightly more TTB-leaning than pure tallying in Exp 1), and (ii) a large DROP in integration consistency when the cue set grows from 5 to 6 features. Crucially, I verified analytically that the two designs are matched on every conflict-trial statistic that a fixed-noise integrator sees (weighted margins, SNR, dominance of the top cue — if anything top-cue dominance is HIGHER in Exp 1), so no shared-parameter validity weighting alone can produce the gap; the gap must be carried by a feature-count-dependent noise term. This is exactly the arbiter's mechanism (3): 'effective decision noise grows with feature count'.

MECHANISMS. NVW implements the arbiter's prescription: (1) weights w_j = v_j^gamma nest Tallying (gamma=0) and TTB (gamma->inf); (2) a one-reason lapse mode with rate omega coupled to the validity dominance of the top discriminating cue over the opposing majority's cues; (3) cue-wise attention alpha plus a capacity/interference term: beyond a working-memory span of ~4 cues, each extra pooled cue multiplies evidence reliability by delta, so noise grows steeply with feature count; (4) softmax response rule with inverse temperature beta plus an independent lapse epsilon.

CALIBRATION LOGIC. Because parameters are sampled per subject from the declared ranges and metrics are computed on the pooled population, the ranges themselves are the population-level fit (this is visible in pi_2: its 0.86 tally-consistency in BOTH experiments equals 1 - E[epsilon]/2 under uniform sampling of epsilon in [0, 0.5]). I therefore derived the ranges analytically from the conflict-trial structure of both designs so that the SAME parameter distribution reproduces both targets: with gamma ~ U[0.7, 1.3], beta ~ U[5, 11], delta ~ U[0.18, 0.30], the effective Exp-1 sensitivity is beta*delta (mean ~1.9) and the effective Exp-2 sensitivity is beta*delta^2 (mean ~0.47). Averaging the logistic over these ranges yields Exp-1 tally-consistency ~0.79-0.80 (metric P(TTB winner|conflict) ~ 0.20-0.22, real 0.208) and Exp-2 tally-consistency ~0.60-0.61 (metric ~0.15-0.17, real 0.158). The one-reason lapse (omega ~ 0.02) and lapse (epsilon ~ 0.03) contribute the small residual top-cue choices without materially shifting the averages. This is why I propose tighter ranges than the arbiter's illustrative ones: under per-subject uniform sampling, wide ranges (e.g. gamma in [0,4]) would average TTB-like and tally-like subjects and destroy the fit; the ranges above are centered on the region that both experiments jointly identify.

DEVIATION FROM ARBITER DETAIL. I keep the validity-dominance coupling for omega but let its slope (omega_dom) be free-signed: computing actual dominance values (top-cue validity minus mean opposing validity) gives a HIGHER mean in Exp 1 (0.23) than Exp 2 (0.19), so an increasing-with-dominance coupling would push Experiment 1 toward TTB — the opposite of what the data show. The between-experiment gap is instead carried by the capacity-interference term, which is the arbiter's own mechanism (3). The coupling remains in the model, falsifiable against new designs that manipulate the validity gap at fixed tally margins.

FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS. NVW predicts (a) choice consistency falls sharply (geometrically) as feature count grows beyond ~4 at fixed tally margins — distinguishing it from Tallying's invariance; (b) deviations from tally invariance that grow with the validity spread of the cues (via gamma); (c) a small, validity-dominance-modulated minority of pure one-reason choices. It can be validated on new designs that independently manipulate feature count and the top-cue validity gap.
