# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace SWC with PRIMACY-WEIGHTED INVERTED-VALIDITY COUNTING (PW-IVC). Core claim: subjects read the stated validities but distrust-invert them (acting as if stated validity is the expert's error rate, exactly as in IVC), AND independently overweight EARLY-presented cues via a convex primacy gradient (the mirror image of SWC's recency). Concretely: subjective weight w_j = (1-tau)/n + tau * [ (1-rho) * ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z_v + rho * ((n-j)/(n-1))^eta / Z_p ], a mixture of flat counting, a partially-centered inverted-validity kernel, and a normalized convex primacy kernel; evidence d = sum_j w_j * sign(A_j - B_j); choice is logistic in beta*d plus a small uniform lapse epsilon. Key contrasts with the two existing theories: (i) versus SWC — the position gradient runs from LAST to FIRST (primacy, eta in ~[1.5, 4.5], rho in ~[0.15, 0.5], modest because the anti-validity signal carries most of the variance), so it predicts recency-following BELOW 0.50 on count-neutral equal-validity trials (Exp1: target ~0.34), a negative recency-gradient score (Exp2: target ~-0.17), recency-consistency below 0.5 (Exp8: target ~0.37) and final-expert dominance below 0.5 (Exp10: target ~0.40, since the final expert is both late-positioned and high-validity, so primacy and distrust both discount it); (ii) versus IVC — the added primacy kernel breaks IVC's parameter-free flatness wherever validities are tied, and on designs where the low-validity expert appears EARLY (as in Exp9's layout [0.5, 0.9, 0.6, 0.95, 0.5, 0.6], where inverted-validity mass and primacy mass are positively correlated on early positions) the two components reinforce, raising IVC-preferred adherence from IVC's 0.648 toward the observed 0.788. Keep tau high (~[0.80, 0.95]) so the anti-validity kernel continues to nail Exp5 (-0.576) and Exp7 (0.231), and keep beta moderate (~[1.8, 5.0]) with epsilon ~[0.08, 0.22] to preserve the Exp6 anchor (~0.84) and the Exp3/Exp4 TTB-vs-tally levels (~0.21, ~0.16). This theory is the only one that can simultaneously explain the anti-validity signature (Exp 5, 7, 9), the anti-recency/primacy signature (Exp 1, 2, 8, 10), and the anchor/tally behavior (Exp 3, 4, 6), making it a genuinely stronger competitor to the surviving IVC rather than a re-parameterization of a falsified recency mechanism.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
PRIMACY-WEIGHTED INVERTED-VALIDITY COUNTING (PW-IVC). Subjects read the communicated validities but systematically distrust-invert them: they act as if each stated validity were the expert's error rate, so highly validated experts are discounted most (the anti-validity signature). Independently and additively, subjective attention is tilted toward EARLY-presented cues by a steep convex primacy gradient concentrated on the first one or two positions, at a small share of the subjective-weight mixture so the distrust kernel retains dominance wherever validity information varies. Each cue j carries weight w_j = (1-tau)/n + tau * [ (1-rho) * ((1-v_j) - c*min_k(1-v_k))^gamma / Z_v + rho * ((n-j)/(n-1))^eta / Z_p ]; evidence d = sum_j w_j * sign(A_j - B_j) is integrated additively over all discriminating cues; choice is logistic in beta*d with a small uniform lapse epsilon. On tied-validity designs the distrust kernel is exactly flat and the primacy kernel alone supplies the early-vs-late contrast, producing below-chance recency-following; on decreasing-validity layouts the distrust kernel dominates and reproduces the anti-validity regression signature.

`rationale`:
Minimal-diff edit: the PW-IVC mechanism and all code are unchanged from the accepted iter-2 base; only the parameter box is re-calibrated exactly per the critic's three-knob directive, because the iter-2 diagnosis was again mixture balance plus choice gain, not mechanism. (1) rho: [0.10, 0.28] -> [0.16, 0.34]. The iter-2 trim over-corrected: Exp9 regressed from 0.432 to 0.460 against a real 0.341 because the fitter parks rho at the low end to protect Exps 3/5, starving the primacy kernel on tied-validity designs where it is the sole non-flat signal. The new ceiling sits BETWEEN iter 1's 0.55 and iter 2's 0.28 (explicitly not back at either extreme, to avoid oscillation), restoring Exp9/Exp10 anti-recency pull without re-opening the Exp3/Exp5 cancellation that only appeared at rho ~ 0.5. (2) beta: [1.8, 5.0] -> [2.2, 6.5]. This is the key decoupling knob: on Exp9's count-neutral trials the primacy evidence d is small but nonzero, and on Exps 3/5/7/10 the distrust evidence already points the right way — a steeper logistic sharpens choices around BOTH signals, pushing every currently-deficient metric in its needed direction (Exp3 more negative toward -0.576, Exp5 down toward 0.231, Exp7 up toward 0.788, Exp9 down toward 0.341, Exp10 more negative toward -0.173). The Exp4 anchor is safe because sigmoid(beta) saturates well before beta=5 at |d|=1 and the lapse caps adherence near 0.84. (3) gamma: [2.6, 3.4] -> [2.9, 3.8] with tau unchanged at [0.88, 0.97]: Exp3 is still 0.14 short of -0.576 and Exp5 0.06 short, so the distrust kernel needs slightly more steepness to dominate the mixture's validity variance. Everything else is deliberately untouched: eta stays at [3.5, 6.5] (it worked), epsilon stays at [0.08, 0.22] (raising it would fix Exp8 but break Exps 5/9 by pulling them toward 0.5), c stays at [0.0, 0.2] (a weak knob at these error-rate ranges). Per the critic's directive I explicitly ACCEPT Exp8 (~0.31-0.34 vs real 0.396) as the family-wide residual miss — every distrust-based theory undershoots it (pi_5: 0.356, pi_5_1: 0.339) — and do not trade the anti-validity (Exps 3, 5) or anti-recency (Exps 9, 10) signatures away to chase it. Exp2 (+0.079 currently) may drift slightly with higher beta; it is monitored but the signature experiments take priority, exactly as instructed. The iter-1 -> iter-2 trajectory (Exp3 error +0.51 -> +0.14, Exp5 error +0.21 -> +0.06) confirms the PW-IVC structure is the right vehicle and merely needs its mixture shares and choice gain re-balanced once more.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1512 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1014 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0989 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0989.

    # cues (count difference = 0), IVC's evidence d = 0 and P(choose A) =
    # 0.50 exactly -- the lapse preserves 0.5. This is parameter-free.
    #
    # SWC, in contrast, has strictly increasing weights in cue position
    # (lambda >= 0.8, rho >= 0.8, convex recency), and on count-neutral
    # trials its evidence reduces EXACTLY to d = lambda*rho*sum_j pos_j*s_j,

    # subject-level choice rates roughly in [0.60, 0.79].

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed PW-IVC family (distrust-inverted validity kernel + convex primacy gradient + flat tally mixture + logistic lapse), and it clearly delivers on the anti-recency side: Exp6 (0.376 vs 0.374), Exp10 (-0.170 vs -0.173), and Exp4 (0.843 vs 0.843) are essentially perfect, and Exp9 moves off IVC's parameter-free 0.50 in the right direction. However, the additive primacy kernel is contaminating the distrust kernel exactly where the two signals oppose each other, and the damage is severe in the two experiments that constitute the anti-validity signature. (1) Exp3 (validities strictly decreasing with position): the primacy gradient loads mass onto early, high-validity cues while the distrust kernel loads mass onto late, low-validity cues — the two cancel, and the partial regression coefficient on validity-weighted evidence collapses from the real -0.576 (and IVC's -0.54/-0.56) to -0.067, with subject variance exploding to 0.041. The theory's headline mechanism is effectively neutralized in this layout. (2) Exp5 (validities [0.95, 0.90, 0.85, 0.62, 0.50, 0.50]): on validity-vs-recency conflict trials, distrust and recency both favor the late/low-validity option; the primacy kernel pulls toward the early/high-validity option and drags adherence from the real 0.231 (IVC: 0.254/0.237) up to 0.444 — nearly chance, destroying the below-chance anti-validity signature. Secondary misses all point the same way: Exp8 overshoots downward (0.308 vs 0.396 — the final high-validity expert is double-discounted by distrust AND anti-primacy), Exp1 overshoots (0.283 vs 0.208), Exp2 overshoots slightly (0.204 vs 0.158). Meanwhile Exp9 (0.432 vs 0.341) and Exp7 (0.693 vs 0.788) still need MORE early-position pull. The diagnosis is a mixture-balance problem, not a mechanism problem: rho in [0.20, 0.55] gives the primacy kernel too large a share of the mixture, so wherever validity decreases with position (Exps 1, 3, 5 — the classic layouts) it cancels the distrust signal that carries most of the empirical variance.
Rationale: verdict is regenerate, but this is a tuning directive within the prescribed PW-IVC family — the mechanism is right, the mixture is mis-calibrated. Concretely: (1) REDUCE the primacy share: rho from [0.20, 0.55] down to roughly [0.10, 0.28]. This directly repairs Exp3 (the cancellation of the distrust regression coefficient) and Exp5 (validity-adherence back below chance), and simultaneously pulls Exp8's final-expert dominance back up toward 0.40 and Exp1/Exp2 down toward 0.21/0.16, since in all these decreasing-validity layouts primacy currently fights the dominant distrust signal. (2) COMPENSATE the tied-validity experiments with a SHARPER, not LARGER, primacy kernel: raise eta from [2.0, 5.0] to roughly [3.5, 6.5]. On Exp9's count-neutral trials the anti-recency signal depends on the early-vs-late weight CONTRAST, which convexity provides even at small rho, so a steep gradient concentrated on the first cue or two preserves (and improves) the 0.43 → 0.34 pull toward anti-recency while the reduced rho limits collateral damage in Exps 3/5/8. In Exp7's layout [0.5, 0.9, 0.6, 0.95, 0.5, 0.6] the steep gradient concentrates primacy mass on position 0 (validity 0.5), exactly where distrust mass is maximal, so the two reinforce and IVC-preferred adherence should rise from 0.693 toward 0.788 rather than fall. (3) Raise tau toward [0.88, 0.97] and gamma toward [2.6, 3.4] so the distrust kernel retains dominance of the mixture and restores the Exp3 coefficient near -0.5; keep beta in [1.8, 5.0] and epsilon in [0.08, 0.22] untouched — the Exp4 anchor (0.843 exact) and Exp6/Exp10 fits must not be disturbed. Do NOT remove the primacy kernel (that regresses to flat IVC and re-breaks Exps 9/10) and do not switch families; the parameter box above keeps the arbiter's PW-IVC structure intact while re-balancing which component carries the variance.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1512 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1014 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-2 re-calibration was a clear success and the gate confirmed it (loss 0.1512 -> 0.1014). Every knob I directed moved in the intended direction on the anti-validity side: Exp3's collapsed regression coefficient recovered from -0.067 to -0.434 (variance down from 0.041 to 0.029), Exp5's validity-adherence dropped from 0.444 back to 0.295 (real 0.231), Exp1 is now essentially perfect (0.222 vs 0.208), and Exp4 (0.847 vs 0.843) and Exp6 (0.392 vs 0.374) remain excellent. The mechanism family is right and the mixture is much better balanced. However, the compensation strategy was only half-successful, and the loss decomposition shows exactly where: (A) Exp9 REGRESSED from 0.432 to 0.460 against a real value of 0.341 — the rho trim (0.55 -> 0.28 ceiling) weakened the primacy share on tied-validity count-neutral trials more than the eta raise (contrast sharpening) compensated, so the anti-recency pull shrank from 0.07 below chance to 0.04 below chance when the data demand 0.16 below chance. Exp10 also slipped from -0.170 to -0.129 against a real -0.173. (B) Exp3 is still 0.14 short (-0.434 vs -0.576) and Exp7 still 0.065 short (0.723 vs 0.788) — both want the distrust kernel to carry even more of the choice variance. (C) Exp2 drifted slightly wrong (0.237 vs 0.158, worse than iter 1's 0.204). (D) Exp8 remains stuck at 0.315 vs 0.396, but note this is a family-wide residual: the best any distrust-flavored theory achieves is 0.356-0.393, so -0.08 is near the family floor and should not be purchased at the cost of the signature experiments. The diagnosis is again mixture balance, not mechanism: the fitted rho evidently sits near the low end of its new box to protect Exps 3/5, leaving the primacy kernel under-powered exactly where it is the ONLY signal (tied-validity designs, Exps 9/10). The fix is not to re-inflate rho to iter-1 levels (that re-breaks Exps 3/5) but to (i) partially restore rho's ceiling to a midpoint between the two iterations, and (ii) amplify BOTH kernels' choice-level impact via beta, which strengthens the Exp9 anti-recency pull, pushes Exp3 more negative, Exp5 further below chance, Exp7 up toward 0.788, and Exp10 more negative — all currently-needed directions — while the Exp4 anchor is lapse-capped and safe.
Rationale: verdict is regenerate, but this is a fine-tuning iteration within the prescribed PW-IVC family — the mechanism and code are correct and should not be restructured. Three coordinated parameter-box changes, explicitly chosen to avoid oscillation (rho's new ceiling sits BETWEEN iter 1's 0.55 and iter 2's 0.28, not back at either extreme): (1) rho: [0.10, 0.28] -> [0.16, 0.34]. Iter 2's trim over-corrected: Exp9 regressed (0.432 -> 0.460 vs target 0.341) because the fitter parks rho at the low end to protect Exps 3/5, starving the primacy kernel on tied-validity designs where it is the sole non-flat signal. A modest ceiling raise, combined with (2) below, restores Exp9/Exp10 pull without re-opening the Exp3/Exp5 cancellation that only appears at rho ~ 0.5. (2) beta: [1.8, 5.0] -> [2.2, 6.5]. This is the key decoupling knob: on Exp9's count-neutral trials the primacy evidence d is small but nonzero, and on Exp3/5/7/10 the distrust evidence is already pointing the right way — a steeper logistic sharpens choices around BOTH signals, pushing every currently-deficient metric in its needed direction (Exp3 more negative, Exp5 down toward 0.231, Exp7 up toward 0.788, Exp9 down toward 0.341, Exp10 more negative). The Exp4 anchor is safe because sigmoid(beta) saturates well before beta=5 at |d|=1 and the lapse caps it; verify Exp4 stays within ~0.02 of 0.843. (3) gamma: [2.6, 3.4] -> [2.9, 3.8], tau unchanged at [0.88, 0.97]: Exp3 is still 0.14 short of -0.576 and Exp5 0.06 short, so the distrust kernel needs slightly more steepness to dominate the mixture's validity variance. Keep eta at [3.5, 6.5] (it worked — do not touch), keep epsilon at [0.08, 0.22] (raising it would fix Exp8 but break Exps 5/9 by pulling them toward 0.5), and keep c at [0.0, 0.2] (a weak knob at these error-rate ranges). Explicitly ACCEPT Exp8 (~0.31-0.34 vs real 0.396) as the family's residual miss — every distrust-based theory undershoots it (pi_5: 0.356, pi_5_1: 0.339) — and do NOT trade the anti-validity (Exps 3, 5) or anti-recency (Exps 9, 10) signatures away to chase it. Also monitor Exp2 (currently +0.079): if the higher beta pushes it further above 0.158, note it but prioritize the signature experiments. Do not switch mechanism families and do not remove the primacy kernel; the iter-1 -> iter-2 trajectory (Exp3 +0.51 -> +0.14, Exp5 +0.21 -> +0.06) confirms the prescribed PW-IVC structure is the right vehicle and merely needs its mixture shares and choice gain re-balanced once more.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1014 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0989 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "The iter-3 re-calibration was directionally correct and the gate confirmed it (0.1014 -> 0.0989). Every knob I directed moved as predicted on the under-signed metrics: Exp2 improved (+0.079 -> +0.055), Exp5 (+0.064 -> +0.054), Exp7 (-0.065 -> -0.048), Exp9 (+0.119 -> +0.071), Exp10 (+0.044 -> +0.019).

The cause is identifiable: the rho ceiling raise (0.28 -> 0.34) let the fitter buy Exp9/Exp10 gains by injecting more primacy mass into the strictly-decreasing-validity layout, where primacy (pro-early = pro-high-validity) directly cancels the distrust kernel. Note the family CAN reach the target here (pi_5: -0.540, pi_5_1: -0.562), so this is calibration, not mechanism. (B) EXP8 worsened slightly (0.315 -> 0.286 vs real 0.396), now below even the distrust-family floor (~0.34); the higher beta double-discounts the final high-validity expert. (C) The remaining misses share a common signature: Exps 3, 5, 7, 9, 10 are ALL under-committed \u2014 choice probabilities sit too close to 0.5 relative to the real data in the direction each metric scores. This is a choice-gain problem (beta/epsilon), not a mixture problem, and it is the one lever not yet fully exploited.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "verdict is regenerate, but this is a final scoped tuning pass within the prescribed PW-IVC family \u2014 the mechanism and code are correct and must not be restructured. Three coordinated changes, explicitly chosen to avoid the rho oscillation (0.55 -> 0.28 -> 0.34; the new ceiling goes BETWEEN the last two, not back to either): (1) rho: [0.16, 0.34] -> [0.16, 0.30]. The iter-3 ceiling raise is precisely what regressed Exp3 from -0.434 to -0.372; the loss decomposition shows Exp3's squared error (~0.042) now dominates the aggregate, while the Exp9 gain it purchased (+0.048 improvement) is worth far less. A modest ceiling trim restores distrust dominance in decreasing-validity layouts. (2) beta: [2.2, 6.5] -> [2.2, 8.0], and epsilon floor: 0.08 -> 0.06. These are the commitment knobs that COMPENSATE the tied-validity experiments for the rho trim: on Exp9's count-neutral trials the anti-recency deviation from 0.5 scales roughly with beta * rho at small evidence, so a ~12% rho cut is offset by a ~15-25% beta headroom, while on Exps 3/5/7/10 the distrust evidence already points the right way and sharper commitment pushes every one of these under-signed metrics toward its target (Exp3 more negative, Exp5 toward 0.231, Exp7 toward 0.788, Exp10 toward -0.173). Lowering the epsilon floor additionally de-attenuates the Exp3 OLS coefficient (the lapse shrinks it toward zero by roughly (1-eps)). (3) Everything else frozen: eta [3.5, 6.5], gamma [2.9, 3.8], tau [0.88, 0.97], c [0.0, 0.2] \u2014 do not touch; they worked in both prior iterations. Guardrails: verify Exp4 stays within ~0.03 of 0.843 (the anchor is lapse-capped, but beta=8 with |d|=1 saturates, so adherence ~ 1 - eps/2; if Exp4 exceeds 0.88, raise the epsilon floor back to 0.10 rather than capping beta). Accept Exp8 as the family residual but monitor it: if the higher beta drives it below 0.27, that is the signal to stop raising beta \u2014 do NOT purchase Exp8 with epsilon (it would re-flatten Exps 5/9) or with rho (oscillation risk). Also monitor Exp2 (currently +0.055): higher beta sharpens its tally-vs-TTB contrast in the wrong direction; if it exceeds +0.07, note it but keep prioritizing the signature experiments (3, 5, 7, 9, 10), exactly as in prior iterations. If this pass lands Exp3 near -0.45 and holds the other gains, the candidate should be shippable; the iter-1 -> iter-3 trajectory (Exp3 error +0.51 -> +0.14 -> +0.20, aggregate 0.151 -> 0.101 -> 0.099) confirms the structure is right and only the commitment level and the rho ceiling need one final coordinated nudge."
