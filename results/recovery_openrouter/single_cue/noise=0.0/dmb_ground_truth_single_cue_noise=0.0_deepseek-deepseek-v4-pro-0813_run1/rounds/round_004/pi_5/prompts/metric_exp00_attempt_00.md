# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** Eleven experts: one lone 50% cue and ten tightly clustered 84.0%-86.7% cues. The median validity is 85.2% and MAD is about 0.9 percentage points, so under the advocated normalized-deviance model the 50% cue is a huge deviance outlier. It receives roughly 96% of normalized weight, while the three just-below-median experts swept in the design (84.0%, 84.3%, 84.6%) together carry only about 3% of weight and the higher experts carry almost none. This near-monopoly activates the single-cue high-share/gap gate and quenches the softmax beta to its low floor, so the advocated model predicts essentially flat choice functions across the three-expert sign sweep: p(A) near 0.50 in the low-tie block and a nearly constant value above 0.50 in the low-favors-A block. In the competing rank model bottom_share is only 1/11, so delta=0 and beta_low near 1.7 applies. Rank weights give the lone 50% cue about 0.44 of total weight, while the top three swept high cues together retain about 0.50 of weight, so the same 2x2x2 sign sweep moves competing signed evidence from about -0.50 to +0.50 in the tie block (p(A) roughly 0.30 to 0.70) and from about -0.06 to +0.94 in the low-favors-A block (p(A) rising from below 0.50 to above 0.80). The first low-favors-A pair is a directional reversal: the lone low cue favors A while all three swept high cues favor B, giving advocated p(A) above 0.50 but competing p(A) around 0.47. Features 4-10 are tied at 1 in every trial so they do not affect either model. This one-low plus tight-high-validity ensemble is distinct from the already-explored two-, three-, and four-low designs.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People normalize each advertised cue validity relative to the current task ensemble, giving salience only to cues whose validity falls below the ensemble median. Low-validity outliers dominate the signed feature tally, with ties contributing zero. The decisiveness of the softmax choice rule is itself context-gated: when a single cue becomes a near-monopoly in normalized decision weight, the response temperature is quenched toward chance; when a small set of low-validity cues is nearly co-equal, the response is sharpened. This keeps equal-weight tallying as a limiting case while allowing reversed-validity-like and regime-sensitive choice behavior.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People assign choice weight by each expert's rank inside the advertised validity ensemble, strongly discounting higher ranks. The steepness of that discount is fixed, but the weight floor given to the high-validity tail is gated by how large the lower-validity bloc is. When low-validity experts form a large subgroup of the ensemble, a small floor is added so that the many high-validity cues are not completely ignored; this prevents the extreme rank-reversal saturation seen in balanced low/high ensembles. When low-validity experts are a small minority, the floor is zero, the high-validity tail is almost fully suppressed, and the response temperature is lowered so that the remaining single-cue contrasts are not over-saturated. Signed weighted tallies, with ties contributing zero, then pass through the regime-appropriate fixed-temperature softmax with a small lapse probability.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

It then averages this signed evidence across A choices only, so trials where the participant chooses A contribute their rank-signed evidence and B choices contribute zero. Under the competing theory the three swept high cues shift rank-signed evidence from about -0.5 to +0.5 in the tie block and from about -0.06 to +0.94 in the low-favors-A block, producing a clearly larger weighted choice average. Under the advocated theory the lone 0.50 cue has near-monopoly normalized weight and the softmax beta is quenched, so choices barely track the rank-signed sweep and the same average stays much lower. Because the metric pools all 16 conditions and all repetitions into one linear summary, its per-subject sampling variance is small."
