# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_8`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_8`).

Replace pi_8 with a new theory, e.g. 'Gated validity-gap compensation' (GVC). Keep the successful low-cue core from pi_9: below-median cues receive median/MAD deviance-anchored weight, with lone-diagnostic-cue amplification and count-dependent attenuation for multiple simultaneously diagnostic low cues. Change the high-cue side qualitatively: drop the rank-based high-cue baseline entirely. Instead give at/above-median cues only a small baseline plus a bonus proportional to a validity-gap score, e.g. (validity - median)/scale, and gate that bonus by a low-cue configuration factor. The gate should be near zero when a lone below-median cue is diagnostic (preserving Exp1 and Exp14 lone-low following), small when low cues have very large deviance (preserving Exp2, 7, 10, 11), and larger when below-median cues form a homogeneous bloc of three or more (allowing the high-cue influence seen in Exp4, 6, and 13). Conflict between low and high evidence should further damp the high-cue bonus. Finally, use a fixed-temperature softmax with no lapse floor, since Exp15 estimates lapse at 0.0. This differs from pi_8 by removing the rank-based high-cue baseline and the entropy/conflict temperature machinery, and differs from pi_9 by replacing its rank-ordered high-cue bonus with a validity-gap bonus gated by low-bloc homogeneity/deviance, which should also reduce the over-predicted high-cue contrast in Exp8 while retaining high-cue effects where validity gaps are large.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Gated validity-gap compensation with hard-zero default gate and sharper low-bloc licensing (GVC-z). People anchor advertised expert validities to the current ensemble median. Below-median cues earn decision weight through a median/MAD deviance score, with lone diagnostic low-cue amplification and count-dependent attenuation when multiple below-median cues are diagnostic. At/above-median cues receive no default weight; their validity-gap bonus is licensed only by a very homogeneous bloc of three or more simultaneously diagnostic below-median cues, with no default high-cue gate, strong conflict damping, and stronger attenuation for multiple simultaneously diagnostic low cues. Choice is a fixed-temperature softmax with no lapse floor.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal in-family repair of GVC-d. The high-cue gate default is now exactly zero, so no-active-low trials (Exp14) receive no unlicensed high-cue bonus and lone-low trials (Exp12/15/16) lose residual high-cue dilution. The homogeneous below-median bloc boost is sharply reduced and its homogeneity exponent is increased from 2 to 4, targeting the over-predicted high-cue contrast in Exp6 without removing the licensed high-cue contribution needed in Exp4/13. Count-dependent attenuation for multiple diagnostic low cues is strengthened by raising phi, pulling Exp5 toward its lower observed low-side following. Lone low-cue amplification is strengthened with larger lambda and smaller sigma to push Exp12/16 closer to observed lone-cue following, while rho is modestly increased to preserve high-validity contrast where licensed, particularly Exp2.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1932 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1021 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0786 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0786.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The GVC candidate gets many of the core low-cue patterns right. Exp2, Exp7, Exp8, Exp9, Exp10, Exp11, and Exp12 are all in the right qualitative range, with Exp10 and Exp11 excellent, and Exp7 and Exp9 near zero as observed. However the candidate fails badly on three experiments. Exp14 is the worst: observed 0.0278, candidate 0.4189. In Exp14 the low-cue configuration appears never to be diagnostic, yet GVC initializes the high-cue gate at 1.0 and leaves it fully open, so the validity-gap bonus applies without any low-cue licensing. Humans show essentially no high-cue contrast there. Exp15 and Exp16 show the opposite failure: observed lone-low following of 0.7742 and 0.8392, candidate only 0.4636 and 0.5683. The lone diagnostic low cue is too easily diluted by the many at-or-above-median cues, likely because w_hi0 remains nonzero and accumulates across many high features, and the lone_floor gate is not close enough to zero. Exp6 is also clearly over-predicted: observed 0.1525, candidate 0.4571, indicating the homogeneous below-median bloc boost reopens high-cue compensation too strongly. There are also moderate overshoots in Exp3, Exp4, and Exp5, though those are less decisive than Exp14 through Exp16.
Rationale: Keep the GVC family and fixed-temperature softmax, but repair the gate and high-cue baseline. First, the gate should not default to 1.0. Add a small gate_base parameter, roughly 0.00 to 0.10, and make the homogeneous below-median bloc boost additive rather than multiplicative on a tiny base, so that no-active-low trials like Exp14 produce almost no high-cue influence while Exp4, Exp6, and Exp13 can still retrieve their required high-cue effects. Second, for the lone-low failures in Exp15 and Exp16, set w_hi0 to zero or near 1e-5 and shrink lone_floor to roughly 0.00 to 0.03, so many at-or-above-median cues cannot collectively dilute one diagnostic low cue. A modest increase in lambda may help but should be monitored against Exp1. Third, reduce the homogeneity boost b_boost from 1.5 to 2.8 down to roughly 0.4 to 1.0, or tighten H_spread and conflict damping K, to bring Exp6 down toward the observed 0.1525. These are in-family gate and parameter repairs, not a replacement of the prescribed GVC mechanism.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1932 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1021 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: GVC-d is a substantial improvement over the previous iteration. Exp13 matches exactly, Exp9 is nearly exact, Exp10 and Exp11 are strong, Exp15 has been repaired to within about 0.02 of observed, and Exp8 stays near zero. The prior gate repair clearly helped Exp14, Exp15, and Exp16. However the candidate is not yet experiment-invariant. The largest remaining failures are Exp6, where the homogeneous below-median bloc still opens the high-cue gate far too strongly, producing 0.4629 against an observed 0.1525, and Exp14, where no-active-low trials still receive a residual high-cue bonus through gate_base, producing 0.1967 against 0.0278. Lone-low following is also still too weak in Exp12 and Exp16: 0.7500 and 0.7535 against observed 0.8375 and 0.8392. This suggests the nonzero gate_base, multiplied by lone_floor, leaves enough high-cue weight to dilute a single diagnostic low cue. There are also moderate overshoots in Exp5, Exp3, and Exp4, with errors of roughly 0.07 to 0.15. Exp2 remains underweighted on the high-validity side, and the previous b_boost reduction did not move Exp6, so a sharper homogeneity trigger rather than another broad b_boost shrink is needed.
Rationale: Stay within the prescribed GVC family and keep the fixed-temperature softmax with no lapse. Make targeted in-family repairs. First, set gate_base to 0 or at most 0.005; since w_hi0 is already zero, this removes the unlicensed high-cue bonus on no-active-low trials like Exp14 and should also remove residual high-cue dilution on lone-low trials in Exp12 and Exp16. If Exp2 loses directional contrast because of this, compensate by increasing rho to about 0.04 to 0.08 or raising beta, not by reopening gate_base. Second, tighten the bloc license for Exp6: lower b_boost to roughly 0.10 to 0.35 and sharpen H_spread to about 0.05 to 0.15, or increase the homogeneity exponent, so only very homogeneous three-plus below-median blocs can open the gate; recheck Exp4 and Exp13 to ensure their high-cue contributions remain. Third, strengthen count-dependent attenuation for multiple active low cues by raising phi to about 0.40 to 0.60, which should pull Exp5 from 0.897 toward 0.827, while monitoring Exp10. Fourth, if Exp12 and Exp16 remain below about 0.80 after gate_base is zeroed, raise lambda to about 2.8 to 3.2 with sigma near 0.15 to 0.25 rather than restoring w_hi0 or any high-cue baseline.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1021 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0786 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current GVC-z candidate is a major improvement over the previous iterations and remains faithful to the prescribed gated validity-gap compensation family. Several experiments now match almost exactly: Exp9 is essentially exact, Exp13 remains exactly 0.0, Exp14 has been repaired from 0.4189 to 0.0117 against an observed 0.0278, Exp15 is near perfect at 0.7720 against 0.7742, and Exp10/Exp11 continue to fit well. The hard-zero gate default and the removal of the high-cue baseline clearly worked. However the candidate is still not experiment-invariant. The worst remaining failure is Exp6, where the homogeneous below-median bloc gate still opens too strongly: candidate 0.4821 against observed 0.1525, an error of +0.3296. The prior b_boost and H_spread changes did not fix it, which suggests the problem is that the homogeneity boost is still licensed independently of how diagnostic the low-cue bloc actually is. Exp3 is also substantially over-predicted (-0.5365 against -0.3485), as is Exp4 (-0.7783 against -0.6533). These suggest that multiple low cues still accumulate too much choice pressure, partly because the fixed-temperature softmax is saturating under high beta. Exp5 remains too high (0.8992 against 0.8275) for the same reason. On the high-cue side, Exp2 is still under-predicted (-0.7440 against -0.8592), so licensed validity-gap compensation may be too weak. Lone-low behavior is still asymmetric: Exp12 is too weak (0.7412 against 0.8375) while Exp16 is too strong (0.8796 against 0.8392), indicating the lone amplification term lacks the contextual opposition sensitivity needed to separate these cases.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Regenerate with targeted in-family repairs. First, fix Exp6 by making the homogeneous low-bloc license more stringent and diagnosis-sensitive. The homogeneous boost should not be a bare additive gate += b_boost * hom for any spread below H_spread. Raise the homogeneity exponent to roughly 6-10 or narrow H_spread to about 0.01-0.04, and additionally scale b_boost by a low-cue activation factor such as tanh(mean(dev[active_below]) / D_boost) with D_boost around 1.0-2.0. This keeps a strong license for genuinely diagnostic homogeneous blocs in Exp4 and Exp13, while suppressing the near-median homogeneous blocs that likely drive the Exp6 over-prediction. Second, after tightening that gate, increase the licensed high-cue response to recover Exp2: raise rho to roughly 0.08-0.14 or loosen conflict damping by raising K to about 0.6-1.0, while keeping gate_base and w_hi0 at zero. Third, reduce overall saturation in multi-low-cue configurations: lower beta to about 1.4-1.8 and slightly strengthen phi to about 0.55-0.75, which should pull Exp3, Exp4, and Exp5 toward their observed values. To avoid losing lone-low following, pair this with stronger lone amplification, with lambda around 3.4-4.2 and sigma near 0.10-0.18. Fourth, make lone amplification opposition-sensitive: multiply the lone amplification term by 1 + nu * min(n_opposing_at_or_above, cap), with nu around 0.05-0.15 and cap around 3-5. This should raise Exp12, where a lone below-median cue faces several opposing above-median cues, without further inflating Exp16, where lone-cue following is already too strong. Keep the fixed-temperature softmax with no lapse and the hard-zero high-cue default; these are parameter-level and gating repairs within the prescribed GVC family."
