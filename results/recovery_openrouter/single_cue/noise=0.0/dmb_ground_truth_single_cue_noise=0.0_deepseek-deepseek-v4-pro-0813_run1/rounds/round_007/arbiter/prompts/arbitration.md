# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_8" and "pi_9") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_8" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_9" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_8
People anchor each advertised expert validity to the current ensemble, so cues below the ensemble median earn decision weight through a median/MAD-normalized deviance score that is multiplicatively amplified by cue distinctiveness. A homogeneous low-validity bloc shares weight evenly, while a single extreme low-validity cue becomes highly salient and dominates the signed evidence. A small, strictly bounded rank-based baseline keeps high-validity cues from being ignored, with strength that increases with high-bloc size and decreases when low cues are highly distinctive. Choice stochasticity is governed by a conditional entropy/conflict gate: homogeneous multi-cue low blocs receive a high temperature drive floor, whereas conflict damping is strengthened selectively when the high-validity bloc outnumbers multiple low cues or when a low cue is solitary and highly distinctive. This preserves strong homogeneous low-bloc choices and extreme-outlier following without allowing high-cue sweeps or high-distinctness conflicts to over-saturate.

## THEORY 2 — pi_9
Deviance-anchored, state-gated high-cue bonus with diagnostic low-cue attenuation (DASH). People anchor each advertised expert validity to the current ensemble median. Below-median cues earn weight from a median/MAD-normalized deviance score, but when two or more below-median cues are diagnostic on a trial their weights are attenuated by a count-dependent factor, preventing co-equal low-validity blocs from dominating choice. A solitary diagnostic below-median cue instead receives an amplified weight, capturing strong lone-cue following. Above-median cues receive only a tiny at-median baseline plus a rank-ordered bonus that is gated by current signed low-cue evidence and low-versus-high conflict. Choice is a fixed-temperature softmax with no lapse floor.

**Rationale:** This nine-expert design uses a single below-median cue at 0.899 against an ensemble median of 0.900, with eight high/median cues from 0.900 up to 0.995. The below-median cue is diagnostic on every trial, while the high block is swept from all favoring B to all favoring A. Under the advocated theory, the lone 0.899 cue has only modest median/MAD deviance (MAD is 0.001, so deviance is roughly 0.09), giving it a moderate raw weight that does not monopolize the ensemble. The eight high cues receive rank-based baseline weight whose total is larger than the lone low weight. When the low cue favors A and all eight high cues favor B, the signed evidence becomes negative and conflict damping keeps beta low, predicting p(A) just below 0.5. When the high block sweeps toward A, evidence becomes strongly positive and p(A) rises to roughly 0.7. The mirrored low-favors-B block gives the reverse psychometric curve. In the competing theory, the solitary diagnostic below-median cue is multiplicatively amplified by the solitary-cue factor, while the high cues receive at most tiny gated bonuses, so the lone low cue controls the normalized evidence on every trial. The competing theory therefore predicts a nearly flat, low-cue-following probability in each block, near 0.82 to 0.88 in the low-A block and near 0.12 to 0.18 in the low-B block, irrespective of the high-block pattern. The critical dissociations are low-A k=0 and low-B k=8, where the advocated theory predicts p(A) below 0.5 while the competing theory strongly follows the lone low cue. The 18 unique pairs are two mirrored blocks by k=0..8 high cues favoring A, giving K=5 repetitions for roughly 90 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 18 unique pairs × 5 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric measures the extent to which choices track the lone below-median cue (feature 0, validity 0.899) across the two blocks. It is the mean B-choice rate on low-B trials minus the mean B-choice rate on low-A trials. The competing theory predicts that the solitary diagnostic low cue dominates every trial, so this block difference is near 0.64 to 0.76. The advocated theory predicts that high/median cues retain substantial total weight, so the block contrast is much smaller, roughly 0.10 to 0.20. Averaging over all 45 trials in each block keeps the per-subject estimate tight.

**Rationale:** Thirteen experts are used with median validity 0.800 and MAD 0.0005. Experts 0 and 1 lie just below the median at 0.799 and 0.7995, six experts sit exactly at the median, and five high experts run from 0.850 to 0.995. Because MAD is tiny, the two below-median cues receive large median/MAD deviance. In the advocated DASH theory, a lone diagnostic below-median cue receives a strong solitary-cue amplification, while two simultaneously diagnostic below-median cues receive count-dependent attenuation, so the low cues dominate the normalized decision weight and the high cues contribute only w_hi0 plus a small gated rank bonus. DASH therefore predicts roughly flat low-cue-following psychometric curves: p(A) stays near 0.80 when the diagnostic low cue(s) favor A and near 0.20 when they favor B, irrespective of the number k of high cues favoring A. In the competing distinctive low-cue dominance theory, the two low cues are close together so distinctiveness is small, while the eleven at-or-above-median cues receive a larger rank-based baseline, especially for the high-validity experts. Sweeping the high bloc from all favoring B to all favoring A should therefore move the competing p(A) from below 0.50 to above 0.50 in the low-favors-A blocks, and from above 0.50 to below 0.50 in the low-favors-B blocks. The k=0 and k=2 lone-low trials are the strongest directional dissociations, and the paired-low trials test DASH count-dependent attenuation. Sixteen unique pairs are repeated K=6 times for about 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric is the mean rate at which a subject chooses the option favored by the most diagnostic below-median cue, feature index 0 with validity 0.799 versus the 0.800 median. On every trial exactly one option has feature 0 equal to 1, so this is well defined. DASH predicts that below-median deviance-anchored evidence dominates choice across the high-cue sweep, producing a high low-cue-following rate around 0.70 to 0.75 even when the high-validity bloc opposes it. The competing distinctive low-cue dominance theory assigns substantial rank-based weight to the 11 at-or-above-median cues, so high-cue sweeps pull choices toward chance and the low-cue-following rate is expected near 0.50 to 0.55. Averaging over all 96 trials per subject makes the metric very stable, so the between-theory gap should be highly reliable at the human sample size.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.

  "interpretation": "pi_9 is the stronger theory overall. On the two focal experiments it is decisively better: Exp1 observed 0.774 vs pi_9 0.749 vs pi_8 0.144; Exp2 observed 0.839 vs pi_9 0.835 vs pi_8 0.551. These experiments were designed to test lone/multiple below-median cue dominance, and the real data clearly show deviant-cue following, falsifying pi_8's core claim that a bounded rank-based high-cue baseline keeps high-validity cues from being ignored. Across the older experiments pi_9 is also closer on Exp4, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, often within sampling noise, while pi_8 is closer on Exp3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, and 16, but those advantages are mostly small and do not offset pi_8's catastrophic misses on Exp1/2. However, pi_9 is not task-invariant either: both theories badly miss Exp8 (observed 0.153 vs 0.472/0.483), both under-shoot the high-cue dominance in Exp4, pi_9 under-shoots lone-cue following in Exp14, and both over-predict lapse in Exp15 and high-cue effects in Exp16. Thus neither current theory explains all experiments; the right move is to replace the weaker theory, pi_8, with a new theory that keeps pi_9's successful low-cue core but fixes the high-cue and lapse mechanisms.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_8 with a new theory, e.g. 'Gated validity-gap compensation' (GVC). Keep the successful low-cue core from pi_9: below-median cues receive median/MAD deviance-anchored weight, with lone-diagnostic-cue amplification and count-dependent attenuation for multiple simultaneously diagnostic low cues. Change the high-cue side qualitatively: drop the rank-based high-cue baseline entirely. Instead give at/above-median cues only a small baseline plus a bonus proportional to a validity-gap score, e.g. (validity - median)/scale, and gate that bonus by a low-cue configuration factor. The gate should be near zero when a lone below-median cue is diagnostic (preserving Exp1 and Exp14 lone-low following), small when low cues have very large deviance (preserving Exp2, 7, 10, 11), and larger when below-median cues form a homogeneous bloc of three or more (allowing the high-cue influence seen in Exp4, 6, and 13). Conflict between low and high evidence should further damp the high-cue bonus. Finally, use a fixed-temperature softmax with no lapse floor, since Exp15 estimates lapse at 0.0. This differs from pi_8 by removing the rank-based high-cue baseline and the entropy/conflict temperature machinery, and differs from pi_9 by replacing its rank-ordered high-cue bonus with a validity-gap bonus gated by low-bloc homogeneity/deviance, which should also reduce the over-predicted high-cue contrast in Exp8 while retaining high-cue effects where validity gaps are large."
