# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People do not stop after the first discriminating cue, nor do they weight every cue equally. Instead, they form a continuous decision value by comparing the two options on every feature, weighting each signed feature comparison by a monotonically increasing function of the advertised cue validity. Cues with validity near chance are either ignored or heavily discounted, while highly valid cues receive much larger weight. Ties on a feature contribute zero evidence. The resulting validity-weighted evidence sum is passed through a softmax with inverse temperature beta, plus a small uniform lapse probability epsilon.

**Rationale:** This theory replaces the failing Take-The-Best mechanism with graded integration over all cues. Unlike TTB, it predicts that lower-validity opposing cues still shift choice probability, which is needed for the negative Exp1 psychometric slope. Unlike pure equal-weight Tallying, it discounts low-validity cues through (validity - offset)^gamma. At offset = 0.5 the lowest possible advertised validity contributes zero weight, so cues with weak diagnosticity are heavily downweighted without being used in a non-compensatory stopping rule. This predicts a flatter Exp1 slope than equal-weight tallying while preserving the graded raw-margin effect needed for Exp2. Beta and the lapse term epsilon provide the response-noise curvature calibrated to the observed Exp1 and Exp2 metric values.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[1.0, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.25]`
  - `offset`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.5, 2.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    # advertised in the instructions and no trial-by-trial feedback is given.

        )

    offset = float(parameters["offset"])
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])

    # Monotone diagnosticity weight: w_j = max(validity_j - offset, 0)^gamma.
    # For offset = 0.5 and gamma = 1 this is a validity-gain weighting,
    # giving chance cues zero weight.
    weights = np.maximum(validities - offset, 0.0) ** gamma

```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python

    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** People treat advertised expert validity as a cue to ignore rather than trust: cues with low validity, especially those near chance, receive the largest decision weight, while very high-validity cues are discounted because they are seen as redundant or overstated. Choices are formed by a continuous reversed-validity weighted additive comparison of the two options, with signed feature differences weighted by an inverse diagnosticity function of the advertised validities. Ties on a feature contribute zero evidence. The accumulated evidence then passes through a softmax choice rule with inverse temperature beta, plus a small uniform lapse probability epsilon that captures attentional or motor noise.

**Rationale:** The previous validity-weighted model assumed that advertised validity should be used monotonically and positively, with high-validity cues dominating. That assumption generated the wrong sign on the key contrast in Experiments 3 and 4. The present theory reverses the diagnosticity mapping: weights are a decreasing function of advertised validity, implemented here as w_j = (theta - validity_j)^gamma. Low-validity cues therefore control the decision, which produces the negative top-cue-opposition slope in Experiment 1, the negative directional-minus-margin contrast in Experiment 2, the negative rank correlation in Experiment 3, and the negative high-versus-low feature-block difference in Experiment 4. A moderately sharp softmax (beta around 5) and a small lapse (epsilon around 0.2) keep the predicted choice probabilities noisy and human-like rather than deterministic, preserving the observed negative signs while matching the moderate empirical magnitudes.

**Parameters:**
  - `theta`: `{1.0}`
  - `gamma`: `[0.3, 0.4]`
  - `beta`: `[4.8, 5.5]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.15, 0.25]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    # instructions and no trial-by-trial feedback is provided.
