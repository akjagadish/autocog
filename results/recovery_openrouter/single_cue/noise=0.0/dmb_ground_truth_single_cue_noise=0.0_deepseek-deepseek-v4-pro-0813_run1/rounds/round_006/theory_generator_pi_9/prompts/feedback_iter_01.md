# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_8`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with a new theory: Deviance-anchored, state-gated high-cue bonus (DASH). The theory retains median/MAD deviance weighting for below-median cues, with a solitary-low-cue amplifier, but abandons pi_5's beta-gating and replaces it with a constant sensitivity rule plus state-dependent high-cue weighting. Specifically: (1) For each cue, compute d_i = max(0, median(v) - v_i)/(MAD+c). Below-median cues get weight w_i = w0 + kappa * d_i^gamma. If exactly one below-median cue exists, apply a solitary amplifier (1 + lambda * tanh(d_i/sigma)); if several co-equal low cues exist, no beta boost is applied. This explains Experiment 1's epsilon near zero and Experiment 14's strong lone-cue following. (2) Above-median cues receive a very small at-median baseline and a rank-ordered bonus rho * rank_i^alpha for cues strictly above the median; at-median cues get near-zero extra weight. This preserves rank-weighted high-cue effects in Experiments 12 and 13 while preventing the excessive high-tally effects seen in Experiment 2. (3) The high-cue rank bonus is gated by current below-median evidence and conflict: multiply it by |E_low|/(|E_low| + a) and by 1/(1 + (conflict/K)^2). This suppresses high-cue influence when the lone low cue is tied (Experiment 2) and in strong low-versus-high conflicts (Experiments 8 and 14). (4) Choice is softmax with a constant inverse temperature beta around 1-3, no epsilon floor, and no near-monopoly or co-equal beta sharpening. Suggested broad parameter ranges: w0 in [0.005, 0.02], kappa in [1, 3], gamma in [1, 2], lambda in [1, 2], rho in [0.01, 0.05], alpha in [2, 5], a in [0.2, 0.5], K in [0.3, 0.7], beta in [1.2, 2.5]. This theory should beat pi_5 on its own former critical experiments and compete with pi_8 on the remaining ones while being more task-invariant across the domain.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Deviance-anchored, state-gated high-cue bonus (DASH), recalibrated for multi-cue low blocs. People anchor each advertised expert validity to the current ensemble median. Below-median cues earn weight from a median/MAD-normalized deviance score, but when several below-median cues coexist their shared weight is attenuated to avoid low-cue dominance. A solitary below-median cue instead receives an amplified deviance weight. Above-median cues receive only a tiny at-median baseline plus a rank-ordered bonus that is gated by current signed low-cue evidence and low-versus-high conflict. Choice is a fixed-temperature softmax with no lapse floor.

`rationale`:
Minimal-diff recalibration of DASH. The main structural addition is a multiplicative attenuation `multi_low_scale` applied only when more than one below-median cue exists, directly reducing the co-equal low-bloc dominance that inflated Experiments 3, 4, 5, and especially 6. The solitary low-cue amplifier (`lambda`, smaller `sigma`) is strengthened to preserve lone-cue following in Experiment 12. The high-cue rank bonus is suppressed more aggressively by lowering `K`, raising `a`, and slightly reducing `rho`/`w_hi0`, while keeping a constant-temperature softmax with no epsilon floor so Experiment 13 remains at the zero-lapse point. These edits stay inside the arbiter-prescribed DASH family and use only parameter-range plus one small gating term change.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0823 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1237 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0823.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The DASH candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed mechanism family and it gets several key patterns right: the rank-weighting metrics in Experiments 10 and 11 are almost exact, Experiment 13 returns the zero-lapse point estimate, and the near-zero high-cue slopes in Experiments 8 and 9 are captured. However, the candidate is not experiment-invariant in its current calibration. Its largest miss is Experiment 6, where it produces 0.4688 against a human value of 0.1525, roughly a threefold overstatement of the low-cue contrast. The same over-dominance of below-median evidence appears in Experiment 4 (-0.7925 vs -0.6533), Experiment 5 (0.8888 vs 0.8275), and Experiment 3 (-0.4460 vs -0.3485). At the same time, the conditions that DASH was specifically designed to explain are slightly under-fit: Experiment 2 is -0.7488 against -0.8592, and the lone-cue following in Experiment 12 is 0.7706 against 0.8375. This pattern suggests the fixed low-cue weight kappa * d_i ** gamma is too high for co-equal low-cue blocs, while the solitary amplifier is a little too weak and the high-cue gating is not suppressing top-cue influence strongly enough in strong low-versus-high disagreement.
Rationale: Keep the DASH architecture but recalibrate within it. The below-median baseline should be reduced for multi-low-cue trials, e.g. by lowering w0 and kappa/gamma or increasing c, so that Experiments 4, 5, and especially 6 stop overstating low-cue dominance. To preserve the DASH-specific lone-cue result, raise lambda toward its upper allowed value and lower sigma so the solitary amplifier compensates for the smaller baseline, keeping Experiment 12 near 0.84. The high-cue rank bonus should be suppressed more aggressively when a below-median bloc opposes the high cues, e.g. by increasing a and/or lowering K toward the lower end of its range, which should close the Experiment 2 gap without restoring the high-tally effects that Experiments 8, 9, and 14 require to stay near zero. The proposer should keep the fixed-temperature softmax and no epsilon floor, but should search the revised parameter ranges with priority on Experiments 6, 2, 4, and 12 while checking that Experiments 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 do not regress.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0823 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1237 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current DASH variant succeeded on the multi-low-cue targets it was aimed at: Experiment 1 improved from a delta of -0.0242 to -0.0085, Experiment 3 from -0.0975 to -0.0245, Experiment 4 from -0.1392 to -0.0425, Experiment 5 from +0.0613 to +0.0171, and Experiment 6 from +0.3162 to +0.2317, though Experiment 6 is still badly overfit. However, the same round regressed several experiment-invariant anchors. Experiment 12 fell from 0.7706 to 0.6694 against a real value of 0.8375, which is a large worsening of exactly the solitary-low-cue pattern DASH was meant to explain. Experiment 13 moved from a perfect 0.0000 to 0.1080, losing the zero-lapse property. Experiment 2 worsened from +0.1104 to +0.1800 off the real value, and Experiment 10 also drifted from -0.0039 to -0.0160. The aggregate loss increased from 0.0823 to 0.1237 and the gate rejected the candidate. The most likely causes are: first, multi_low_scale is triggered by the total number of below-median cues, including cues that never differ between options on a trial, so the lone diagnostic low cue in Experiment 12 was attenuated as if it were part of a low-cue bloc and the solitary amplifier was not applied; second, the high-cue rank bonus and its gate were suppressed too aggressively following the previous critique, which damaged Experiment 2, Experiment 10, and especially the zero-lapse pattern in Experiment 13.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Remain inside the DASH family. First, fix the multi-low trigger: make it diagnostic on the current trial by counting only below-median cues with nonzero signed difference between the options, i.e. abs(A - B) > 0. Apply multi_low_scale only when at least two such active below-median cues exist, and apply the solitary amplifier when exactly one active below-median cue exists. This should restore Experiment 12 toward 0.83-0.84 while retaining the gains on Experiments 3, 4, 5, and 6. Second, reverse the aggressive high-cue suppression from this iteration because the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate. Move rho and w_hi0 back toward the iter1 ranges, loosen the gate by placing K back around 0.35-0.55 and a around 0.25-0.40. This should bring Experiment 2 back toward -0.80 to -0.86, restore Experiment 10 near 0.20, and return Experiment 13 to a zero-lapse estimate. Third, if Experiment 6 remains too positive, tighten multi_low_scale into roughly 0.22-0.45 and search Experiment 6 jointly against Experiments 3, 4, and 5 so the attenuation does not overshoot the already well-fit metrics. To protect Experiment 14 if the restored high-cue gain starts inflating its high-tally effect, keep the low-evidence gate strong so high-cue rank bonuses vanish when absolute low-cue evidence is small. Keep the constant-temperature softmax and do not add an epsilon floor."
