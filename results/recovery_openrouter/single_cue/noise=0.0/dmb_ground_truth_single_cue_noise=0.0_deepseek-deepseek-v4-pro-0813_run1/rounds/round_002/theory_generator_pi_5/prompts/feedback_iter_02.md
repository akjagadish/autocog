# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace pi_2 with a context-sensitive ensemble salience weighting theory. The theory claims people first normalize each advertised validity relative to the ensemble of validities shown in the current task; a cue receives decision weight according to how much its validity stands out from the distribution, not according to raw validity alone. A simple implementation: compute a deviance score for cue j, such as d_j = abs(v_j - median(v)) / (MAD(v) + c), where MAD is median absolute deviation and c is a small floor, then set w_j = w0 + kappa * d_j ^ gamma; aggregate signed feature differences sum_j w_j * (A_j - B_j) through a softmax with inverse temperature beta and lapse epsilon, with feature ties contributing zero. This predicts Exp1 because 0.50 and 0.51 are dramatic low-validity outliers in a mostly 0.98 to 0.995 set, so they are strongly upweighted and produce low-side choice near 0.83. It predicts Exp2 because the validities form two balanced clusters, 0.50 to 0.53 and 0.97 to 0.995, no cue is an outlier, w_j collapses toward an equal-tally floor, and only a modest contrast around 0.15 remains. The same mechanism should preserve pi_4-like fits on the skewed Exp5 and Exp6 distributions and remain flexible on Exp3 and Exp4, while being a distinct competitor: it differs from pi_4 by using ensemble-relative salience instead of raw inverse validity, and from pi_2 by treating equal tally as a limiting case rather than a fixed rule. Parameter ranges should allow kappa near zero for the near-tally regime and moderately large kappa for the outlier regime, with w0 controlling the equal-weight floor.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People judge each advertised cue validity relative to the ensemble of validities in the current task, but the salience bonus is a saturating function of the cue's one-sided deviance below the ensemble median. A low-validity cue receives decision weight that rises with its deviance but asymptotes, so extreme low-validity outliers cannot absorb nearly all of the normalized decision weight. Cue weights are normalized to sum to one, and choices are formed by a salience-weighted signed tally of feature differences, with feature ties contributing zero, followed by a softmax choice rule with inverse temperature beta and a small lapse probability epsilon. Equal-weight tallying remains the limiting case when no cue is a low-validity outlier, while the saturating transform keeps extreme-outlier experiments from over-concentrating choice on a single cue.

    # state is array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B.
    # History is ignored because validities are advertised in the instructions and no
    # trial-by-trial feedback is provided.
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError('Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus array.')

- d0: [0.15, 0.45]
- beta: [2.8, 4.2]
- epsilon: [0.04, 0.10]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
This edit keeps the accepted ensemble-relative, one-sided salience structure but replaces the unbounded power deviance with a saturating deviance function, d / (1 + d/d0). The saturation bounds extreme low-validity outliers so they cannot receive near-unit normalized weight, which is the main cause of the Experiment 6 over-salience. To compensate for the compression of moderate deviances, kappa is raised so Experiments 2, 3, and 4 retain enough validity-driven asymmetry. Beta is moved modestly upward and epsilon modestly downward to sharpen the Experiment 2 reversal contrast toward the observed strongly negative value, while the saturating weights prevent the same temperature change from overshooting Experiments 5 and 6. The near-perfect Experiment 1, 3, and 5 fits are left structurally intact: the same one-sided low-validity salience, normalized tally, softmax, and lapse machinery is preserved.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2172 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0695 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1409 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0695.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the arbiter's ensemble-relative salience family, and it fits Experiment 5 very well (0.8387 vs 0.8275) and Experiment 1 tolerably (a bit too negative). However, it substantially misses several key experiments. Its simulated values on Experiment 3 (+0.0083 vs real -0.3485), Experiment 4 (-0.0908 vs real -0.6533), and Experiment 6 (-0.0125 vs real +0.1525) are close to the old equal-tally pi_2 values and fail in sign or magnitude. Experiment 2 is also too weak (-0.6971 vs real -0.8592). The candidate is therefore behaving too much like an equal-weight tally mechanism and not generating enough cue-validity-driven asymmetry.
Rationale: The likely causes are: (1) w0=0.10-0.20 is too large, so the equal-weight floor dominates; (2) kappa=0.20-0.60 and gamma=0.35-0.50 compress the salience bonus, so moderate ensemble deviances barely change cue weights; and (3) the absolute-value deviance is symmetric around the median, so in experiments where high- and low-validity clusters are both distant from the median they receive similar bonuses and their contributions cancel, producing near-chance choices (especially Experiment 4). Within the prescribed ensemble-relative salience family, the next candidate should: lower w0 to near zero (about 0.00-0.05), raise kappa substantially (e.g., 1.0-4.0 or higher) and increase gamma to at least 1 so the salience bonus dominates the floor; use a one-sided, low-validity salience term such as d_j = max(0, median - v_j)/(MAD+c) rather than an absolute deviance, so low-validity outliers receive large weight without being cancelled by equally salient high-validity outliers; and reduce c to about 0.005-0.02 to sharpen ensemble contrast. To avoid overshooting Experiment 6 toward pi_4's +0.666, keep beta in the moderate range or lower it slightly as kappa increases, and possibly cap the total evidence scale. The target should be to move Experiment 3 clearly negative, Experiment 4 strongly negative, and Experiment 6 moderately positive while preserving the already good Experiment 5 fit.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2172 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0695 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is a large, faithful improvement over iter 1 and remains inside the arbiter's ensemble-relative salience family. It now fits Experiment 1 (-0.098 vs -0.096), Experiment 3 (-0.360 vs -0.349), and Experiment 5 (0.831 vs 0.828) almost exactly, and Experiment 4 is close (-0.619 vs -0.653). The remaining problems are magnitude errors in two experiments with opposite directions: Experiment 6 is over-salient (0.412 vs real 0.153), while Experiment 2 is under-salient (-0.605 vs real -0.859). The Exp6 direction is correct but the normalized one-sided weights are letting the most extreme low-validity cue(s) nearly decide the choice, producing too much contrast; in Exp2 the reversal is in the right direction but too compressed.
Rationale: Keep the current one-sided, ensemble-normalized salience machinery, but revise the large-deviance transform rather than switching families. Use a saturating deviance function—e.g. d_eff = d / (1 + d/d0) or log1p(d)—so extreme low-validity outliers receive bounded weight instead of near-unit normalized weight. Then re-tune kappa upward for mid-range deviances to preserve Exp2/Exp3/Exp4, and consider a modestly lower epsilon or higher beta to push Exp2 contrast toward -0.75/-0.85 without overshooting Exp4/Exp5. The target is to leave the near-perfect Exp1/3/5 fits intact while pulling Exp6 down toward roughly +0.1 to +0.2.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0695 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1409 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is a faithful in-family edit, but the gate rejected it (loss 0.1409 > 0.0695). Its one genuine improvement is Exp2 (-0.8468 vs real -0.8592), but the intended Exp6 fix failed badly: it moved from the already-too-high iter2 value of 0.4121 to an even worse 0.5813 against a real value of 0.1525. Simultaneously Exp4 overshot to -0.8508 (real -0.6533), and the previously near-perfect Exp1, Exp3, and Exp5 fits regressed. Mechanistically, the saturating deviance does not prevent cue dominance under l1 normalization: if only one low-validity cue has positive deviance, its normalized share approaches 1 whenever kappa*f(d) >> n*w0. With d0 in the 0.15-0.45 range and kappa in 4-10, that condition still holds, so the outlier cue remains near-unit in weight; the higher beta and lower epsilon then amplify that concentrated evidence. The net effect is a global-decisiveness overshoot, not a targeted Exp6 damping.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Return to the accepted iter2 base and avoid repeating the previous global kappa-up/beta-up/epsilon-down strategy, which the gate has now rejected. Instead make two surgical in-family changes. First, fix Exp6 at the normalization stage: enforce a maximum normalized cue-weight share, e.g. cap max_i(w_i)/sum(w) at roughly 0.30-0.40, so a lone extreme low-validity cue cannot absorb near-unit decision weight. This should pull Exp6 from ~0.41/0.58 down toward 0.1-0.2 while mostly preserving the good iter2 Exp1/3/4/5 fits. Second, improve Exp2 with a context-gated temperature rather than a global beta increase: use a higher effective beta or lower lapse only in the balanced near-tally regime, e.g. beta_eff = beta0 + beta_boost*exp(-|evidence|/scale), or gate the boost on a low maximum weight share. That sharpens the weak-evidence Exp2 contrast toward roughly -0.80 to -0.86 without further steepening the already-concentrated Exp6 and Exp4 regimes. Keep kappa/d0 either identical to the accepted base or only mildly adjusted, and tune just the weight-share cap and the near-tally boost."
