# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_4" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_4
People treat advertised expert validity as a cue to ignore rather than trust: cues with low validity, especially those near chance, receive the largest decision weight, while very high-validity cues are discounted because they are seen as redundant or overstated. Choices are formed by a continuous reversed-validity weighted additive comparison of the two options, with signed feature differences weighted by an inverse diagnosticity function of the advertised validities. Ties on a feature contribute zero evidence. The accumulated evidence then passes through a softmax choice rule with inverse temperature beta, plus a small uniform lapse probability epsilon that captures attentional or motor noise.

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # Reversed-diagnosticity weighted additive integration.
    # state is expected to be array-like of shape (2, n_features),

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

**Rationale:** This design tests whether low-validity experts are overweighted (reversed-validity) against the equal-count Tallying benchmark. Two experts are advertised near chance (50%, 51%) and seven are near-perfect (98%–99.5%). On every trial the two low-validity experts favor one option while k = 0…7 high-validity experts favor the other option; all remaining experts are tied. In A-low trials Tallying gives A exactly 2 wins and B k wins, so its tally margin is 2 − k: it crosses chance at k = 2 and predicts B for k ≥ 3. Reversed-validity instead gives the 50%/51% experts weights of about 0.75–0.81 each (the largest weights) and the 98%–99.5% experts weights of about 0.12–0.31 each. The two low weights sum to about 1.5–1.6, which outweighs six of the seven high weights (and all seven for gamma ≈ 0.4). Thus reversed-validity predicts A for k = 0…6 in A-low trials and B for k = 0…6 in B-low trials. The critical k = 2…6 trials therefore produce opposite directional predictions: Tallying chooses the high-validity side (or guesses at k = 2), while reversed-validity chooses the low-validity side. The psychometric crossover is shifted from k = 2 under Tallying to k = 7 or beyond under reversed-validity, a large quantitative dissociation. The two mirrored blocks double observations and control for response bias.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric measures the proportion of choices for the option favored by the two low-validity experts on critical conflict trials where 3, 4, 5, or 6 high-validity experts favor the other option. The reversed-validity theory gives the two near-chance experts weights around 0.75-0.81 each while heavily discounting the 98-99.5% experts, so on these trials the low-validity side has strongly positive evidence and low-side choice probability is roughly 0.85-0.95. Tallying gives the low-validity side exactly 2 feature wins against k wins for the high-validity side, so its low-side choice probability for k=3-6 is near the lapse or guessing floor. The contrast is therefore a large mean difference. Using both mirrored blocks yields 48 trials per subject in this window, keeping binomial variance small; k=0-1 trials are excluded because both theories predict the low-validity side, and k=2 is excluded because Tallying guesses when tallies tie, which would dilute the separation.

**Rationale:** Eight experts with four near-chance validities (0.50-0.53) and four near-perfect validities (0.97-0.995). Reversed-validity weights near-chance experts heavily (weight roughly 0.74-0.81) and discounts near-perfect experts (weight roughly 0.12-0.29), while Tallying gives every expert equal unit weight. The 16 unique pairs form two blocks. Block 1 (pairs 1-8) holds the Tallying margin at 0 (A wins exactly 3 features, B wins exactly 3, 2 ties), so Tallying predicts p(A)=0.5 for every pair. The pairs swap A's wins from low-validity to high-validity features, so reversed-weighted evidence decreases from about +1.7 to -1.7, predicting a graded psychometric curve crossing chance. Block 2 (pairs 9-16) holds the Tallying margin at +2 (A wins 5, B wins 3), so Tallying predicts the same >0.5 p(A) for all eight pairs. The same low-to-high validity swap makes reversed-weighted evidence decrease from about +2.8 to -0.7, so reversed-validity predicts a decreasing curve that crosses below chance on the last three pairs, opposite in direction to Tallying. Thus Tallying predicts two flat lines (0.5 and a single >0.5 value), whereas reversed-validity predicts two graded psychometric functions of weighted evidence, with several pairs yielding opposite directional predictions.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Tallying assigns p(A)=0.5 to every pair in block 1 because the tally margin is 0, and assigns a single flat p(A) to every pair in block 2 because the tally margin is always +2. Any balanced within-block contrast of p(A) therefore has expected value zero under Tallying regardless of beta and epsilon. This metric uses two balanced contrasts. Block 1 compares the four pairs where reversed-validity evidence favors A against the four where it favors B. Block 2 compares the early high A-evidence pairs 9-12 against the final four pairs 13-16, where reversed-weighted evidence becomes weak or negative. Reversed-validity predicts large positive values around 0.6-0.8 in both contrasts, while Tallying predicts zero. Averaging the two contrasts uses all 96 trials and keeps per-subject variance bounded by binomial noise.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the six experiments pi_4 is the better head-to-head account: it is close on Exp1 (0.8642 vs observed 0.8275), Exp4 (-0.8321 vs observed -0.8592), Exp5 (-0.2535 vs observed -0.3485) and Exp6 (-0.7908 vs observed -0.6533), and roughly as close as pi_2 on Exp3 (-0.1505 and -0.1360 vs observed -0.0959). pi_2 only wins decisively on Exp2 (0.0092 vs observed 0.1525, while pi_4 predicts 0.6663), and its equal-weight tally is strongly refuted by Exp1, Exp5 and Exp6. However pi_4's large Exp2 miss is not a minor calibration issue: if the reversed-validity weights are weakened enough to lower Exp2 to about 0.15, the Exp1 low-validity-side choice probability should drop because Exp1 requires the two 0.50 and 0.51 cues to outweigh three to six near-perfect cues. This pattern points away from a fixed feature-weighting function of raw validity and toward a context-dependent weighting mechanism.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_2 with a context-sensitive ensemble salience weighting theory. The theory claims people first normalize each advertised validity relative to the ensemble of validities shown in the current task; a cue receives decision weight according to how much its validity stands out from the distribution, not according to raw validity alone. A simple implementation: compute a deviance score for cue j, such as d_j = abs(v_j - median(v)) / (MAD(v) + c), where MAD is median absolute deviation and c is a small floor, then set w_j = w0 + kappa * d_j ^ gamma; aggregate signed feature differences sum_j w_j * (A_j - B_j) through a softmax with inverse temperature beta and lapse epsilon, with feature ties contributing zero. This predicts Exp1 because 0.50 and 0.51 are dramatic low-validity outliers in a mostly 0.98 to 0.995 set, so they are strongly upweighted and produce low-side choice near 0.83. It predicts Exp2 because the validities form two balanced clusters, 0.50 to 0.53 and 0.97 to 0.995, no cue is an outlier, w_j collapses toward an equal-tally floor, and only a modest contrast around 0.15 remains. The same mechanism should preserve pi_4-like fits on the skewed Exp5 and Exp6 distributions and remain flexible on Exp3 and Exp4, while being a distinct competitor: it differs from pi_4 by using ensemble-relative salience instead of raw inverse validity, and from pi_2 by treating equal tally as a limiting case rather than a fixed rule. Parameter ranges should allow kappa near zero for the near-tally regime and moderately large kappa for the outlier regime, with w0 controlling the equal-weight floor."
