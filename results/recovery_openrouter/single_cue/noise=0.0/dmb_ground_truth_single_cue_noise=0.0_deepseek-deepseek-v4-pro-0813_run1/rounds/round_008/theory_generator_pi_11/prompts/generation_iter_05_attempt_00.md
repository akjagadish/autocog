# generation_iter_05_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_10`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_9`).

Propose a new theory that keeps pi_10's low-cue strengths but replaces the high-cue machinery of both theories. The new theory should retain: median anchoring of advertised validities, MAD-normalized positive deviance weights for below-median cues, count-dependent attenuation when several below-median cues are diagnostic, and strong but capped lone-cue amplification when exactly one below-median cue is diagnostic. This preserves the observed zero slope in Experiment 2, the strong lone-low following in Experiments 14 and 18, and the exact no-lapse pattern in Experiment 15. The new part should be a sign-flexible above-median consensus term instead of pi_9's positive baseline plus gated rank bonus or pi_10's homogeneous-bloc-licensed positive gap bonus. Specifically: when low-cue evidence is nonzero and opposes the above-median cues, the high-cue term should be gated to near zero; when low-cue evidence is exactly balanced and the above-median cues form a strong one-sided consensus, allow a negative weight on that consensus so high-cue adherence can fall below 0.5 as in Experiment 1; when low-cue evidence is weak or absent and the high-cue configuration is moderate or spread out, assign a small positive rank-ordered weight, but cap its total contribution to avoid the large overshoot seen in Experiment 8. Choice can remain stochastic, but include a small response-bias or lapse floor so near-zero metrics such as Experiments 9, 10 and 11 are stable. Parameter ranges should be modest for the low-deviance boost, lone amplification, opposition sensitivity, negative consensus weight, positive rank-bonus cap and softmax temperature.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_10` (overall score: 0.867)

**Description**
Conflict-gated validity-gap compensation with strict homogeneous-bloc licensing and stronger opposition-sensitive lone amplification (GVC-strict). People anchor each advertised expert validity to the ensemble median. Below-median cues earn decision weight through a median/MAD-normalized deviance score. A single diagnostically deviant low cue is strongly amplified, with amplification increasing in the number of opposed at-or-above-median cues. When multiple below-median cues are diagnostic, a homogeneous low-deviant group is attenuated by cue count, but an extreme focal low cue is exempted from that group attenuation so it can still dominate the signed evidence. At-or-above-median cues receive no default weight; their validity-gap bonus is licensed only by a very homogeneous, sufficiently deviant bloc of three or more simultaneously diagnostic below-median cues, and is sharply damped by low-versus-high conflict. Choice is a fixed-temperature softmax with no lapse floor.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.788)

**Description**
Deviance-anchored, state-gated high-cue bonus with diagnostic low-cue attenuation (DASH). People anchor each advertised expert validity to the current ensemble median. Below-median cues earn weight from a median/MAD-normalized deviance score, but when two or more below-median cues are diagnostic on a trial their weights are attenuated by a count-dependent factor, preventing co-equal low-validity blocs from dominating choice. A solitary diagnostic below-median cue instead receives an amplified weight, capturing strong lone-cue following. Above-median cues receive only a tiny at-median baseline plus a rank-ordered bonus that is gated by current signed low-cue evidence and low-versus-high conflict. Choice is a fixed-temperature softmax with no lapse floor.

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.661)

**Description**
People anchor each advertised expert validity to the current ensemble, so cues below the ensemble median earn decision weight through a median/MAD-normalized deviance score that is multiplicatively amplified by cue distinctiveness. A homogeneous low-validity bloc shares weight evenly, while a single extreme low-validity cue becomes highly salient and dominates the signed evidence. A small, strictly bounded rank-based baseline keeps high-validity cues from being ignored, with strength that increases with high-bloc size and decreases when low cues are highly distinctive. Choice stochasticity is governed by a conditional entropy/conflict gate: homogeneous multi-cue low blocs receive a high temperature drive floor, whereas conflict damping is strengthened selectively when the high-validity bloc outnumbers multiple low cues or when a low cue is solitary and highly distinctive. This preserves strong homogeneous low-bloc choices and extreme-outlier following without allowing high-cue sweeps or high-distinctness conflicts to over-saturate.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0878 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0683 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1008 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0679 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5: loss=0.0675 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 5 at loss=0.0675 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
People anchor advertised expert validities to the ensemble median. Below-median cues earn decision weight through a MAD-normalized deviance score. A single diagnostically deviant below-median cue receives strong lone-cue amplification, but when two or more below-median cues are diagnostic on a trial they are all uniformly attenuated by cue count, with no focal-outlier exemption, preventing any multi-low bloc from dominating choice. Above-median cues contribute only through a sign-flexible rank-ordered consensus term: it is gated toward zero when low-cue evidence opposes the above-median cues, becomes negative when genuinely balanced below-median evidence opposes a strong one-sided high-cue consensus, and otherwise contributes a small capped positive rank-ordered weight. Choice is a fixed-temperature softmax with a tiny lapse floor.

`rationale`: This is the surgical in-family correction requested by the most recent feedback. In the n_active >= 2 branch, the full lone-cue amplification of the focal below-median cue is removed: all diagnostic below-median cues are now uniformly multiplied by the same count-dependent attenuation factor, so strong lone amplification applies only when exactly one below-median cue is diagnostic. This directly removes the residual multi-low focal dominance responsible for the Experiment 6 overshoot, and also reduces the related multi-low overweighting in Experiments 3 and 5. Phi is moved to a modest intermediate range ([1.2, 1.5]) to further damp multi-low blocs while remaining safely below the previously rejected stronger attenuation because the balanced low-evidence gate still uses pre-attenuation raw low-cue mass, preserving the exact Experiment 17 anti-consensus behavior. Single-cue experiments 12, 15, and 16 are untouched, and the above-median rank-ordered consensus parameters remain at the accepted base values.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed sign-flexible above-median consensus term, and its low-cue machinery continues to fit Experiments 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, and 18 well. However, several systematic failures remain. The most diagnostic one is Experiment 14, where the model reverses the real pattern (-0.253 vs +0.028): the negative consensus term activates when below-median evidence is effectively absent because the code treats total_low==0 as low_strength=0 and therefore low_bal=1, letting strong_neg fire on trials where no low cue is diagnostic. That produces anti-following of high-cue tallies and also contributes to the wrong-sign Experiment 8 estimate (-0.020 vs +0.047). Experiment 2 remains too weakly directional (-0.635 vs -0.859), indicating the multi-low-cue attenuation is too mild and/or the positive high-cue term is too suppressed. Experiment 6 shows the inherited low-cue amplification overshoots (0.406 vs 0.153), while Experiments 15 and 16 under-follow a lone low cue (0.652 vs 0.774 and 0.772 vs 0.839 respectively), suggesting the lone-cue gain and/or softmax sharpness are slightly too weak once the high-cue term is gated.
Rationale: Keep the same mechanism family and structure, but make targeted in-family recalibrations. (1) Fix the negative-consensus gate: require strong_neg to be allowed only when there is actual below-median evidence, e.g. total_low > min_low_mass (~0.1-0.3), not merely total_low==0, while still requiring low_strength<=low_bal_eps for the balanced-opposition case. This should remove the Experiment 14 sign reversal and nudge Experiment 8 toward zero/positive without hurting Experiments 1 and 17. (2) Strengthen count-dependent attenuation for multiple diagnostic low cues by raising phi to roughly 0.85-1.10; this should reduce the Experiment 6 overshoot and reduce low-cue dominance in Experiment 2, while leaving single-cue experiments largely unaffected. (3) Restore directional high-cue adherence in Experiment 2 by modestly increasing the positive high-cue term when low-cue evidence is weak/moderate: widen weak_thresh to ~0.12-0.20 and/or raise h_pos to ~0.15-0.25, and consider steepening alpha_hi to ~3-4.5 while keeping h_cap so Experiment 8 does not overshoot. (4) Lift lone-low following for Experiments 15/16 by increasing lone_gain to ~5.5-6.5 and/or beta to ~1.85-2.20. If residual over-negativity persists after the total_low gate, lower h_neg to roughly 1.2-1.5. All changes stay within the prescribed sign-flexible consensus architecture and low-cue amplification kernel.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0878 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0683 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed sign-flexible consensus family and is the best base so far. It nails the near-zero or exact patterns in Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, and 18, fixes the Experiment 14 sign reversal, corrects Experiment 8's wrong sign, and remains close on Experiments 1, 4, 5, 7, 12, 15, and 16. The residual failures share a signature: below-median evidence is still overweighted when several low cues are jointly diagnostic or when a lone low cue meets a large opposing high-cue bloc. Experiment 6 is the most diagnostic failure (0.443 vs. 0.153, roughly 2.7 subject-SDs), and Experiment 3 is also too negative (-0.523 vs. -0.349). Experiment 2 is directionally correct but too weak (-0.749 vs. -0.859), indicating the above-median consensus term remains underweighted when low-cue evidence is weak or mixed. Experiments 15 and 16 remain slightly too weak on lone-low following, so the correction must discriminate multi-low and bloc-opposed lone-low cases from single-low low-deviance cases rather than simply blunt all low-cue gain.
Rationale: Keep the accepted structure but make three surgical in-family calibrations. (1) Strengthen the count-dependent attenuation for two or more jointly diagnostic below-median cues: raise phi to roughly 1.5-2.2, or make the attenuation denominator 1 + phi*(n-1) + phi2*(n-1)^2 with phi2 around 0.2-0.5. This should pull Experiment 6 from 0.443 toward ~0.15, reduce the Experiment 3 and 5 over-response, and increase Experiment 2's directional dominance without altering single-cue trials. (2) For the lone-cue path: raise lone_gain modestly to ~6.0-7.0 but add an explicit ceiling on the final amplified low-cue weight (approximately 8-12) so Experiments 15 and 16 rise while Experiment 12 no longer overshoots its 0.838 target. (3) Strengthen the positive above-median consensus contribution when low-cue evidence is weak or balanced: raise rho_hi to ~0.04-0.06 and/or alpha_hi to ~4.5-5.5, optionally h_pos to ~0.25-0.35, but retain h_cap so Experiment 8 stays near zero. After these changes, verify that Experiments 9-11, 13, 17, and 18 remain at their near-zero or near-real values.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0683 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1008 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed sign-flexible consensus family, but it is a clear fit regression: aggregate loss rose from 0.0683 to 0.1008 and the candidate was rejected by the gate. The three bundled changes interacted badly across experiments. The most diagnostic failure is Experiment 17, where the candidate jumps from the accepted base's near-perfect 0.373 to 0.571 against real 0.378. The new quadratic multi-low attenuation drives `active_low_mass` below the fixed `min_low_mass=0.10` threshold, so the balanced low-evidence gate never fires and the negative above-median consensus term is disabled; the high cues are then followed moderately instead of resisted/inverted. Experiment 6 is still badly overshooting (0.455 vs real 0.153), because the focal below-median cue is exempt from the count attenuation, leaving one large amplified low-cue weight. Experiments 15 and 16 regressed on lone-low following (0.733/0.770 vs real 0.774/0.839), consistent with the strengthened positive high-cue term (`h_pos`, `rho_hi`, `alpha_hi`) adding opposing evidence on lone-cue trials. Experiments 2, 8, 13 and 14 also worsened, indicating the rank-ordered above-median bonus is now too strong or too broadly active. The modest improvements in Experiments 3, 4, 5 and 12 do not compensate for these broad regressions.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base, not this rejected candidate. My previous advice — stronger quadratic multi-low attenuation plus a strengthened positive high-cue term plus a lone-cue ceiling — was rejected by the gate, so do not retry that bundle. Instead, use more surgical in-family corrections. (1) Fix the low-balance gate first: make `has_low_evidence` count-based or based on pre-attenuation low-cue mass (e.g. `n_active >= 2` or a threshold on the unattenuated raw weights), rather than the attenuated `active_low_mass`. This should restore the anti-consensus behavior in Experiment 17 without globally raising high-cue adherence. (2) Attenuate the focal low cue in the multi-active case, e.g. multiply the amplified focal weight by the same `att` factor or a separate factor that declines with `n_active`, so Experiment 6 moves toward its real 0.15 while single-cue experiments 12, 15 and 16 are left alone. (3) Return the above-median consensus parameters (`h_pos`, `rho_hi`, `alpha_hi`, `h_cap`) to the accepted base values or slightly lower; if Experiment 2 remains too weakly directional after the gate is fixed, allow a small positive high-cue term only under genuinely weak/absent low evidence rather than strengthening it globally. (4) For Experiments 15 and 16, prefer a mild `nu`/`beta`/`lone_sigma` recalibration on the lone-cue branch over re-applying the rejected global cap/high-cue-strengthening combination. Verify that the near-zero and exact-zero patterns in Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13 and 18 remain stable.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1008 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0679 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains faithful to the prescribed sign-flexible consensus family, and the surgical pre-attenuation gate fix is a genuine success: Experiment 17 is now essentially exact (0.3748 vs 0.3783), and the near-zero/no-lapse patterns in Experiments 9, 11, 13, and 18 remain stable. Most experiments are within roughly half a subject-SD of the real estimate, and several are excellent (e.g., 11, 13, 17). However, Experiment 6 remains a severe, systematic failure: the candidate gives 0.4608 against a real value of 0.1525, a +0.3083 overshoot of about 2.8 subject-SDs, and it has essentially not improved from the prior accepted base despite the stated intent of the focal-attenuation edit. The cause is visible in the code: in the n_active >= 2 branch, the focal below-median cue is still multiplied by lone_amplification (5.5-6.5 gain) after the count-attenuation factor. With phi around 0.85-1.10, the attenuation only partially cancels a 6x focal boost, so multi-active low-cue blocs still dominate choice. Experiment 3 is also pushed too negative (-0.5118 vs -0.3485) and Experiment 5 over-follows low cues (0.8921 vs 0.8275), both consistent with the same multi-low overweighting. Experiment 2 remains weakly directional (-0.7421 vs -0.8592), suggesting the above-median consensus term should not be strengthened globally but may benefit indirectly once multi-low dominance is reduced.
Rationale: Keep this accepted candidate as the base and make one further surgical in-family correction, not a redesign. (1) In the n_active >= 2 branch, do not apply the full lone_amplification to the focal low cue: keep strong lone amplification only for exactly one diagnostic below-median cue, as the arbiter prescription specifies. In the multi-active case, either attenuate all below-median cues uniformly with att, or give the focal cue only a very mild separate boost (e.g., 1 + small_dev_gain*tanh(dev/sigma) rather than the 5.5-6.5 lone_gain). This should directly reduce the Experiment 6 overshoot while leaving single-cue experiments 12, 15, and 16 untouched. (2) If Experiment 6 is still too high after removing the focal lone boost, increase phi modestly to roughly 1.2-1.6, i.e., an intermediate step between the accepted 0.85-1.10 and the previously rejected stronger attenuation, now safe because has_low_evidence already uses pre-attenuation mass so the Experiment 17 gate will not be disabled. Do not re-introduce the rejected global quadratic attenuation or strengthened high-cue bundle. (3) Leave the above-median consensus parameters at their current accepted values initially; after the multi-low correction, check whether Experiment 2 has moved closer to -0.86 before any h_pos/rho_hi adjustment. (4) Verify that the near-zero/exact patterns in Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, and 18 remain stable.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0679 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.0675 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 5 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed sign-flexible consensus family and is the best aggregate loss in this loop. It is excellent or near-exact on the near-zero/exact patterns: Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, and 18 are all close to their real values, and Experiment 14 has the correct sign. However, the core diagnostic failure remains severe: Experiment 6 is 0.4292 against a real value of 0.1525, a +0.2767 overshoot of roughly 2.5 real subject SDs, even after the focal lone-cue amplification was removed from the multi-active branch. Experiment 3 is also too negative (-0.5133 vs -0.3485, about 1.2 SDs), Experiment 2 is still too weakly directional (-0.7315 vs -0.8592), and Experiment 8 remains slightly wrong-signed (-0.0105 vs +0.0472). Critically, the uniform count-dependent attenuation introduced a new regression in Experiment 12: following of the true singleton 0.50 cue fell from 0.8638 in the prior accepted base to 0.7450 against real 0.8375. That happens because the five 0.80 cues sit below the ensemble median in Exp12's validity distribution, so the model treats them as a multi-low bloc and attenuates the very 0.50 cue that should receive strong lone-cue amplification. The current phi=1.2-1.5 is therefore simultaneously too weak where multiple comparable low cues are diagnostic (Experiments 6, 3, 5) and too blunt where one strongly deviant low cue coexists with near-median low cues (Experiment 12).
Rationale: Keep the same sign-flexible above-median consensus architecture, but make the multi-low attenuation deviance-selective rather than uniformly count-based. Do not raise phi globally again, because that will further depress Exp12. Instead, add an outlier test among active below-median cues: when one active below-median cue has much larger deviance than the others (or exceeds an absolute deviance threshold), treat it as an effective singleton, apply strong lone amplification only to that cue, attenuate or demote the mild below-median cues, and let the opposition gate act on the amplified singleton so the high-cue consensus does not suppress it. This should restore Exp12 to roughly 0.84 without changing single-cue experiments 15 and 16. For genuinely multi-comparable low-cue trials with no outlier singleton, strengthen attenuation substantially, e.g. an effective phi around 2-3 and possibly a mild quadratic term gated to no-outlier cases, while keeping the low-balance gate based on pre-attenuation low-cue mass so Experiment 17 remains exact. This should push Exp6 toward ~0.15 and reduce the Exp3/5 over-following. Avoid re-introducing the previously rejected global quadratic attenuation or global strengthening of the positive high-cue term; any stronger attenuation must be conditional on the absence of an extreme low-deviance singleton. After the fix, verify Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, and 18 remain at their current near-zero/exact values.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.0675 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
