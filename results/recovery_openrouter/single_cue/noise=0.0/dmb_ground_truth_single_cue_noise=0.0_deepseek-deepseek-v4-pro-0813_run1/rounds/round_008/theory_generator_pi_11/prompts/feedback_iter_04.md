# feedback_iter_04

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_10`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_9`).

Propose a new theory that keeps pi_10's low-cue strengths but replaces the high-cue machinery of both theories. The new theory should retain: median anchoring of advertised validities, MAD-normalized positive deviance weights for below-median cues, count-dependent attenuation when several below-median cues are diagnostic, and strong but capped lone-cue amplification when exactly one below-median cue is diagnostic. This preserves the observed zero slope in Experiment 2, the strong lone-low following in Experiments 14 and 18, and the exact no-lapse pattern in Experiment 15. The new part should be a sign-flexible above-median consensus term instead of pi_9's positive baseline plus gated rank bonus or pi_10's homogeneous-bloc-licensed positive gap bonus. Specifically: when low-cue evidence is nonzero and opposes the above-median cues, the high-cue term should be gated to near zero; when low-cue evidence is exactly balanced and the above-median cues form a strong one-sided consensus, allow a negative weight on that consensus so high-cue adherence can fall below 0.5 as in Experiment 1; when low-cue evidence is weak or absent and the high-cue configuration is moderate or spread out, assign a small positive rank-ordered weight, but cap its total contribution to avoid the large overshoot seen in Experiment 8. Choice can remain stochastic, but include a small response-bias or lapse floor so near-zero metrics such as Experiments 9, 10 and 11 are stable. Parameter ranges should be modest for the low-deviance boost, lone amplification, opposition sensitivity, negative consensus weight, positive rank-bonus cap and softmax temperature.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People anchor advertised expert validities to the ensemble median. Below-median cues earn decision weight through a MAD-normalized deviance score. A single diagnostically deviant below-median cue receives strong lone-cue amplification, but when two or more below-median cues are diagnostic on a trial they are all uniformly attenuated by cue count, with no focal-outlier exemption, preventing any multi-low bloc from dominating choice. Above-median cues contribute only through a sign-flexible rank-ordered consensus term: it is gated toward zero when low-cue evidence opposes the above-median cues, becomes negative when genuinely balanced below-median evidence opposes a strong one-sided high-cue consensus, and otherwise contributes a small capped positive rank-ordered weight. Choice is a fixed-temperature softmax with a tiny lapse floor.

`rationale`:
This is the surgical in-family correction requested by the most recent feedback. In the n_active >= 2 branch, the full lone-cue amplification of the focal below-median cue is removed: all diagnostic below-median cues are now uniformly multiplied by the same count-dependent attenuation factor, so strong lone amplification applies only when exactly one below-median cue is diagnostic. This directly removes the residual multi-low focal dominance responsible for the Experiment 6 overshoot, and also reduces the related multi-low overweighting in Experiments 3 and 5. Phi is moved to a modest intermediate range ([1.2, 1.5]) to further damp multi-low blocs while remaining safely below the previously rejected stronger attenuation because the balanced low-evidence gate still uses pre-attenuation raw low-cue mass, preserving the exact Experiment 17 anti-consensus behavior. Single-cue experiments 12, 15, and 16 are untouched, and the above-median rank-ordered consensus parameters remain at the accepted base values.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0878 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0683 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1008 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0679 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0675 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 5 at loss=0.0675.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed sign-flexible above-median consensus term, and its low-cue machinery continues to fit Experiments 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, and 18 well. However, several systematic failures remain. The most diagnostic one is Experiment 14, where the model reverses the real pattern (-0.253 vs +0.028): the negative consensus term activates when below-median evidence is effectively absent because the code treats total_low==0 as low_strength=0 and therefore low_bal=1, letting strong_neg fire on trials where no low cue is diagnostic. That produces anti-following of high-cue tallies and also contributes to the wrong-sign Experiment 8 estimate (-0.020 vs +0.047). Experiment 2 remains too weakly directional (-0.635 vs -0.859), indicating the multi-low-cue attenuation is too mild and/or the positive high-cue term is too suppressed. Experiment 6 shows the inherited low-cue amplification overshoots (0.406 vs 0.153), while Experiments 15 and 16 under-follow a lone low cue (0.652 vs 0.774 and 0.772 vs 0.839 respectively), suggesting the lone-cue gain and/or softmax sharpness are slightly too weak once the high-cue term is gated.
Rationale: Keep the same mechanism family and structure, but make targeted in-family recalibrations. (1) Fix the negative-consensus gate: require strong_neg to be allowed only when there is actual below-median evidence, e.g. total_low > min_low_mass (~0.1-0.3), not merely total_low==0, while still requiring low_strength<=low_bal_eps for the balanced-opposition case. This should remove the Experiment 14 sign reversal and nudge Experiment 8 toward zero/positive without hurting Experiments 1 and 17. (2) Strengthen count-dependent attenuation for multiple diagnostic low cues by raising phi to roughly 0.85-1.10; this should reduce the Experiment 6 overshoot and reduce low-cue dominance in Experiment 2, while leaving single-cue experiments largely unaffected. (3) Restore directional high-cue adherence in Experiment 2 by modestly increasing the positive high-cue term when low-cue evidence is weak/moderate: widen weak_thresh to ~0.12-0.20 and/or raise h_pos to ~0.15-0.25, and consider steepening alpha_hi to ~3-4.5 while keeping h_cap so Experiment 8 does not overshoot. (4) Lift lone-low following for Experiments 15/16 by increasing lone_gain to ~5.5-6.5 and/or beta to ~1.85-2.20. If residual over-negativity persists after the total_low gate, lower h_neg to roughly 1.2-1.5. All changes stay within the prescribed sign-flexible consensus architecture and low-cue amplification kernel.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0878 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0683 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed sign-flexible consensus family and is the best base so far. It nails the near-zero or exact patterns in Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, and 18, fixes the Experiment 14 sign reversal, corrects Experiment 8's wrong sign, and remains close on Experiments 1, 4, 5, 7, 12, 15, and 16. The residual failures share a signature: below-median evidence is still overweighted when several low cues are jointly diagnostic or when a lone low cue meets a large opposing high-cue bloc. Experiment 6 is the most diagnostic failure (0.443 vs. 0.153, roughly 2.7 subject-SDs), and Experiment 3 is also too negative (-0.523 vs. -0.349). Experiment 2 is directionally correct but too weak (-0.749 vs. -0.859), indicating the above-median consensus term remains underweighted when low-cue evidence is weak or mixed. Experiments 15 and 16 remain slightly too weak on lone-low following, so the correction must discriminate multi-low and bloc-opposed lone-low cases from single-low low-deviance cases rather than simply blunt all low-cue gain.
Rationale: Keep the accepted structure but make three surgical in-family calibrations. (1) Strengthen the count-dependent attenuation for two or more jointly diagnostic below-median cues: raise phi to roughly 1.5-2.2, or make the attenuation denominator 1 + phi*(n-1) + phi2*(n-1)^2 with phi2 around 0.2-0.5. This should pull Experiment 6 from 0.443 toward ~0.15, reduce the Experiment 3 and 5 over-response, and increase Experiment 2's directional dominance without altering single-cue trials. (2) For the lone-cue path: raise lone_gain modestly to ~6.0-7.0 but add an explicit ceiling on the final amplified low-cue weight (approximately 8-12) so Experiments 15 and 16 rise while Experiment 12 no longer overshoots its 0.838 target. (3) Strengthen the positive above-median consensus contribution when low-cue evidence is weak or balanced: raise rho_hi to ~0.04-0.06 and/or alpha_hi to ~4.5-5.5, optionally h_pos to ~0.25-0.35, but retain h_cap so Experiment 8 stays near zero. After these changes, verify that Experiments 9-11, 13, 17, and 18 remain at their near-zero or near-real values.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0683 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1008 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed sign-flexible consensus family, but it is a clear fit regression: aggregate loss rose from 0.0683 to 0.1008 and the candidate was rejected by the gate. The three bundled changes interacted badly across experiments. The most diagnostic failure is Experiment 17, where the candidate jumps from the accepted base's near-perfect 0.373 to 0.571 against real 0.378. The new quadratic multi-low attenuation drives `active_low_mass` below the fixed `min_low_mass=0.10` threshold, so the balanced low-evidence gate never fires and the negative above-median consensus term is disabled; the high cues are then followed moderately instead of resisted/inverted. Experiment 6 is still badly overshooting (0.455 vs real 0.153), because the focal below-median cue is exempt from the count attenuation, leaving one large amplified low-cue weight. Experiments 15 and 16 regressed on lone-low following (0.733/0.770 vs real 0.774/0.839), consistent with the strengthened positive high-cue term (`h_pos`, `rho_hi`, `alpha_hi`) adding opposing evidence on lone-cue trials. Experiments 2, 8, 13 and 14 also worsened, indicating the rank-ordered above-median bonus is now too strong or too broadly active. The modest improvements in Experiments 3, 4, 5 and 12 do not compensate for these broad regressions.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base, not this rejected candidate. My previous advice — stronger quadratic multi-low attenuation plus a strengthened positive high-cue term plus a lone-cue ceiling — was rejected by the gate, so do not retry that bundle. Instead, use more surgical in-family corrections. (1) Fix the low-balance gate first: make `has_low_evidence` count-based or based on pre-attenuation low-cue mass (e.g. `n_active >= 2` or a threshold on the unattenuated raw weights), rather than the attenuated `active_low_mass`. This should restore the anti-consensus behavior in Experiment 17 without globally raising high-cue adherence. (2) Attenuate the focal low cue in the multi-active case, e.g. multiply the amplified focal weight by the same `att` factor or a separate factor that declines with `n_active`, so Experiment 6 moves toward its real 0.15 while single-cue experiments 12, 15 and 16 are left alone. (3) Return the above-median consensus parameters (`h_pos`, `rho_hi`, `alpha_hi`, `h_cap`) to the accepted base values or slightly lower; if Experiment 2 remains too weakly directional after the gate is fixed, allow a small positive high-cue term only under genuinely weak/absent low evidence rather than strengthening it globally. (4) For Experiments 15 and 16, prefer a mild `nu`/`beta`/`lone_sigma` recalibration on the lone-cue branch over re-applying the rejected global cap/high-cue-strengthening combination. Verify that the near-zero and exact-zero patterns in Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13 and 18 remain stable.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1008 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0679 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains faithful to the prescribed sign-flexible consensus family, and the surgical pre-attenuation gate fix is a genuine success: Experiment 17 is now essentially exact (0.3748 vs 0.3783), and the near-zero/no-lapse patterns in Experiments 9, 11, 13, and 18 remain stable. Most experiments are within roughly half a subject-SD of the real estimate, and several are excellent (e.g., 11, 13, 17). However, Experiment 6 remains a severe, systematic failure: the candidate gives 0.4608 against a real value of 0.1525, a +0.3083 overshoot of about 2.8 subject-SDs, and it has essentially not improved from the prior accepted base despite the stated intent of the focal-attenuation edit. The cause is visible in the code: in the n_active >= 2 branch, the focal below-median cue is still multiplied by lone_amplification (5.5-6.5 gain) after the count-attenuation factor. With phi around 0.85-1.10, the attenuation only partially cancels a 6x focal boost, so multi-active low-cue blocs still dominate choice. Experiment 3 is also pushed too negative (-0.5118 vs -0.3485) and Experiment 5 over-follows low cues (0.8921 vs 0.8275), both consistent with the same multi-low overweighting. Experiment 2 remains weakly directional (-0.7421 vs -0.8592), suggesting the above-median consensus term should not be strengthened globally but may benefit indirectly once multi-low dominance is reduced.
Rationale: Keep this accepted candidate as the base and make one further surgical in-family correction, not a redesign. (1) In the n_active >= 2 branch, do not apply the full lone_amplification to the focal low cue: keep strong lone amplification only for exactly one diagnostic below-median cue, as the arbiter prescription specifies. In the multi-active case, either attenuate all below-median cues uniformly with att, or give the focal cue only a very mild separate boost (e.g., 1 + small_dev_gain*tanh(dev/sigma) rather than the 5.5-6.5 lone_gain). This should directly reduce the Experiment 6 overshoot while leaving single-cue experiments 12, 15, and 16 untouched. (2) If Experiment 6 is still too high after removing the focal lone boost, increase phi modestly to roughly 1.2-1.6, i.e., an intermediate step between the accepted 0.85-1.10 and the previously rejected stronger attenuation, now safe because has_low_evidence already uses pre-attenuation mass so the Experiment 17 gate will not be disabled. Do not re-introduce the rejected global quadratic attenuation or strengthened high-cue bundle. (3) Leave the above-median consensus parameters at their current accepted values initially; after the multi-low correction, check whether Experiment 2 has moved closer to -0.86 before any h_pos/rho_hi adjustment. (4) Verify that the near-zero/exact patterns in Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, and 18 remain stable.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0679 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0675 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is a faithful implementation of the prescribed sign-flexible consensus family and is the best aggregate loss in this loop. It is excellent or near-exact on the near-zero/exact patterns: Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, and 18 are all close to their real values, and Experiment 14 has the correct sign. However, the core diagnostic failure remains severe: Experiment 6 is 0.4292 against a real value of 0.1525, a +0.2767 overshoot of roughly 2.5 real subject SDs, even after the focal lone-cue amplification was removed from the multi-active branch. Experiment 3 is also too negative (-0.5133 vs -0.3485, about 1.2 SDs), Experiment 2 is still too weakly directional (-0.7315 vs -0.8592), and Experiment 8 remains slightly wrong-signed (-0.0105 vs +0.0472). Critically, the uniform count-dependent attenuation introduced a new regression in Experiment 12: following of the true singleton 0.50 cue fell from 0.8638 in the prior accepted base to 0.7450 against real 0.8375. That happens because the five 0.80 cues sit below the ensemble median in Exp12's validity distribution, so the model treats them as a multi-low bloc and attenuates the very 0.50 cue that should receive strong lone-cue amplification. The current phi=1.2-1.5 is therefore simultaneously too weak where multiple comparable low cues are diagnostic (Experiments 6, 3, 5) and too blunt where one strongly deviant low cue coexists with near-median low cues (Experiment 12).",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the same sign-flexible above-median consensus architecture, but make the multi-low attenuation deviance-selective rather than uniformly count-based. Do not raise phi globally again, because that will further depress Exp12. Instead, add an outlier test among active below-median cues: when one active below-median cue has much larger deviance than the others (or exceeds an absolute deviance threshold), treat it as an effective singleton, apply strong lone amplification only to that cue, attenuate or demote the mild below-median cues, and let the opposition gate act on the amplified singleton so the high-cue consensus does not suppress it. This should restore Exp12 to roughly 0.84 without changing single-cue experiments 15 and 16. For genuinely multi-comparable low-cue trials with no outlier singleton, strengthen attenuation substantially, e.g. an effective phi around 2-3 and possibly a mild quadratic term gated to no-outlier cases, while keeping the low-balance gate based on pre-attenuation low-cue mass so Experiment 17 remains exact. This should push Exp6 toward ~0.15 and reduce the Exp3/5 over-following. Avoid re-introducing the previously rejected global quadratic attenuation or global strengthening of the positive high-cue term; any stronger attenuation must be conditional on the absence of an extreme low-deviance singleton. After the fix, verify Experiments 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, and 18 remain at their current near-zero/exact values."
