# Round 0 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.

### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.

            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When

## Replacement

### `pi_3` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** People do not stop after the first discriminating cue, nor do they weight every cue equally. Instead, they form a continuous decision value by comparing the two options on every feature, weighting each signed feature comparison by a monotonically increasing function of the advertised cue validity. Cues with validity near chance are either ignored or heavily discounted, while highly valid cues receive much larger weight. Ties on a feature contribute zero evidence. The resulting validity-weighted evidence sum is passed through a softmax with inverse temperature beta, plus a small uniform lapse probability epsilon.

**Rationale:** This theory replaces the failing Take-The-Best mechanism with graded integration over all cues. Unlike TTB, it predicts that lower-validity opposing cues still shift choice probability, which is needed for the negative Exp1 psychometric slope. Unlike pure equal-weight Tallying, it discounts low-validity cues through (validity - offset)^gamma. At offset = 0.5 the lowest possible advertised validity contributes zero weight, so cues with weak diagnosticity are heavily downweighted without being used in a non-compensatory stopping rule. This predicts a flatter Exp1 slope than equal-weight tallying while preserving the graded raw-margin effect needed for Exp2. Beta and the lapse term epsilon provide the response-noise curvature calibrated to the observed Exp1 and Exp2 metric values.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[1.0, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.25]`
  - `offset`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.5, 2.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # Validity-weighted additive integration.
    # state is array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B. History is ignored because validities are
    # advertised in the instructions and no trial-by-trial feedback is given.
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Validity-weighted integration expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if validities.ndim != 1:
        validities = validities.reshape(-1)

        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {validities.shape[0]} != n_features {stim.shape[1]}."

    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])

    # Monotone diagnosticity weight: w_j = max(validity_j - offset, 0)^gamma.
    # For offset = 0.5 and gamma = 1 this is a validity-gain weighting,
    # giving chance cues zero weight.
