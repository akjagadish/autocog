# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace pi_1 with 'Reversed-Hierarchy Frugality' (misbinding TTB). CORE CLAIM: people are still one-reason decision makers — they consult cues one at a time and let the first discriminating cue decide — but the subjective cue hierarchy is ANTI-correlated with the instructed validities. Mechanistically, subjects misbind the communicated validity list to feature positions (e.g., binding the highest validity to the last-presented feature, a presentation-order/validity misalignment), or equivalently consult cues in ascending subjective validity. No magnitude information and no integration across cues is used; ties on the deciding cascade force a guess. Response noise: softmax with inverse temperature β over the binary winner score, plus lapse ε.

IMPLEMENTATION: predict(parameters, stimulus, history): (1) stim is (2, n_features); (2) build subjective validities w = parameters['validities'] reversed end-to-end (w_j = v_{n−1−j}), or more generally w_j = (1−κ)·v_j + κ·v_{n−1−j} with a binding-confusion parameter κ ∈ [0,1]; (3) run the standard TTB cascade in descending w order (first strict discriminator wins; full tie → uniform guess); (4) softmax with β and lapse ε exactly as in the current pi_1 code. Policy unchanged (sample from the probability vector).

PARAMETER RANGES: β ∈ [0.1, 3.0], ε ∈ [0.0, 0.3], κ ∈ [0.5, 1.0] (the data indicate near-complete reversal: κ ≈ 1 with β ≈ 0.6, ε ≈ 0.1 reproduces Exp 1 ≈ 0.37 and Exp 2 ≈ 0.03 simultaneously). Keep validities as an experiment-supplied parameter.

HOW IT DIFFERS FROM BOTH CURRENT THEORIES: vs. TTB (pi_1), it keeps the frugal one-reason architecture but inverts the cue hierarchy — this is the only single change that lets a frugal model produce Exp 1's below-0.5 level while keeping Exp 2's margin covariance near zero; vs. Tallying (pi_2), it uses no integration at all, so it predicts a FLAT choice profile across tally margins (slope 0) where Tallying predicts a graded psychometric curve — a cleanly opposing, falsifiable signature. The theory is further distinguishable from a mere 'anti-TTB' flip by the κ parameter: designs that decorrelate feature position from validity (shuffled validity-to-position assignment, or probing which specific cue drives choices) can separately identify misbinding, reversal, and noise, and should be used as the next generation of experiments.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &

- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.

  "theory": "Reversed-Hierarchy Frugality (misbinding TTB). People remain one-reason decision makers: they consult cues one at a time and let the first strictly discriminating cue decide, ignoring all lower cues and all magnitude information. However, the subjective cue hierarchy is ANTI-correlated with the instructed validities: subjects misbind the communicated validity list to feature positions — e.g., binding the highest validity to the last-presented feature — so the cascade effectively runs in ascending true validity. A binding-confusion parameter kappa interpolates between the instructed hierarchy (kappa=0) and the fully reversed hierarchy (kappa=1); the data indicate near-complete reversal. When no cue discriminates, the model guesses uniformly. Response noise enters through a softmax with inverse temperature beta over the binary winner score, plus an independent lapse epsilon that mixes in a uniform choice. Because no integration across cues occurs, the model predicts a FLAT choice profile across tally margins (zero psychometric slope), in direct opposition to Tallying's graded curve — a cleanly falsifiable signature distinguishing misbinding from integration.",

  "rationale": "The arbiter diagnosed two mechanistic failures: (a) standard TTB (pi_1) massively over-predicts Experiment 1's metric (0.85 vs real 0.36) and yields the wrong sign in Experiment 2 (-0.16 vs real 0.036); (b) Tallying (pi_2) fails catastrophically in the opposite direction (Exp 1: 0.03 vs 0.36; Exp 2: 1.32 vs 0.036). The single change that reconciles both experiments while keeping a frugal architecture is inverting the cue hierarchy. Concretely: in Experiment 1, the reversed cascade disagrees with the instructed TTB winner on every informative trial, so with moderate noise (beta ~ 0.6, epsilon ~ 0.1, p_follow ~ 0.63) the model matches the TTB-favored option only ~37% of the time at EVERY tally margin — reproducing both the below-0.5 level (real 0.3633) and the near-zero slope, which no integration model can do (Tallying forces a steep positive slope). In Experiment 2, the reversed cascade's signed choice-margin products nearly cancel across the 16 trial types (deterministic sum ~ +3/16), so with noise damping the covariance lands near zero (~0.04 vs real 0.0358), where Tallying predicts a large positive value (1.32) and standard TTB a negative one (-0.16). The kappa parameter makes the misbinding graded rather than all-or-none: kappa=1 is the full presentation-order reversal, and lower values allow partial binding, which lets the model be fitted to, and falsified by, future designs that decorrelate feature position from validity (e.g., shuffled validity-to-position assignments). This keeps the theory experiment-invariant: the mechanism (one-reason stopping rule + anti-correlated subjective hierarchy + softmax/lapse noise) is stated purely in terms of the instructed validities vector, so it adapts to any n_features and any validity profile without hardcoding, unlike position-specific hacks. The flat-margin signature (slope ~ 0) versus Tallying's graded psychometric curve is a strong, falsifiable discriminator, and the near-zero Exp 2 covariance under the same parameter regime that yields Exp 1's below-chance level shows the theory simultaneously satisfies both experiments' constraints — something neither prior theory could do."
