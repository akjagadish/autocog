# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Distrust-Weighted Frugality with Reversal-Coherent Mixture Heterogeneity (softened-gate variant). People are one-reason decision makers: cues are consulted one at a time and the first strictly discriminating cue decides, with no integration across cues (flat psychometric slope over tally margins, consistent with the margin-0 signatures of Exps 3-8). The population-central subjective hierarchy is the anti-validity ('distrust') order: the weakest-advertised expert is consulted first (w = -validity). Heterogeneity is asymmetric and structured: each subject adopts one of a small family of re-encoding rules — distrust-the-weakest (w = -val) or distrust-the-misbinding (w = -val[::-1]) — with the anti-misbound rule's adoption probability gated by binding ambiguity (1 - |Spearman(position, validity)|) times a STEEP, SOFTENED reversal-coherence gate sigmoid((|Spearman(val, val[::-1])| - 0.45)/0.08): subjects adopt the anti-misbound re-encoding only when the binding is non-monotone AND the reversed list is structurally coherent enough to be learnable, with the gate threshold placed low enough (0.45 rather than 0.50) that moderately coherent designs (Exp 5, coherence 0.38) retain enough anti-misbound mass to reproduce their strong misbound-decider follow. Idiosyncratic per-cue distortion (zeta, zero-centered, fixed per subject) accumulates only when every advertised validity is distinct, scaled by the same ambiguity x coherence-gate product. Noise: softmax(beta) over the binary winner score plus lapse epsilon, in the tightened heterogeneous regime (implied follow p mean ~0.72, per-subject SD ~0.02). Validity ties are broken by a free per-subject tie-break. The theory reduces to Weakest-Expert-First Frugality (pi_4) in the ambiguity = 0 special case.

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Attenuated Frugality with Position-Validity Mixture Heterogeneity. People are one-reason decision makers: cues are consulted one at a time and the first strictly discriminating cue decides, with no integration across cues (flat psychometric profile over tally margins, matching the margin-0 signatures of the knife-edge experiments). The subjective cue hierarchy is NOT universal: each subject draws a single consultation order from a graded mixture over a small candidate set: (1) anti-validity (distrust-the-weakest: consult the lowest advertised validity first) as the population-central tendency with a constant base weight; (2) position-primacy (consult experts in reading order, earliest-listed first); (3) position-recency (consult later-listed experts first, a minority variant); and (4) a residual standard-TTB component (descending validity). The position components' mixture weights grow smoothly and linearly with binding ambiguity A = 1 - |Spearman(display position, advertised validity)|, with no sigmoid gates of any kind: when the validity-to-position binding is unambiguous (monotone validity lists), the mixture collapses onto the anti-validity order (plus the small TTB residual), producing strong, consistent one-reason contrasts; when the binding is ambiguous (non-monotone lists), the position components enter, the pooled deciders disperse, and hierarchy-dissociation contrasts collapse toward chance. On top of the discrete mixture, a per-cue idiosyncratic weight distortion (zeta, fixed per subject, zero-centered) is applied, smoothly scaled by ambiguity times reversal-coherence and only when all advertised validities are distinct, so that all-distinct ambiguous designs degrade grain-by-grain while exact validity ties anchor the discrete rule mixture. Response discipline is attenuated and heterogeneous: the decider-follow probability p_f = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2 spans roughly 0.55-0.85 across subjects with mean ~0.73 and SD ~0.06, so pooled contrasts are diluted both by mixture heterogeneity (disagreeing deciders) and by moderate, variable following. Validity ties are broken by a free per-subject tie-break; noise enters as softmax(beta) over the binary winner score plus an independent lapse epsilon; history is ignored (no feedback in this task).

**Rationale:** GOAL: Quantitatively dissociate Distrust-Weighted Frugality with Reversal-Coherent Mixture Heterogeneity (advocated) from Attenuated Frugality with Position-Validity Mixture Heterogeneity (competing). Both are one-reason models sharing the anti-validity central component, so the dissociation must come from their DIFFERENT non-central heterogeneity channels: the advocated adds ONLY an anti-misbound component (w = -val[::-1]) whose adoption is gated by m_am = ambiguity x sigmoid((coherence-0.45)/0.08); the competitor adds ONLY position-primacy (w = -position) and position-recency (w = +position) components whose weights grow LINEARLY in ambiguity, plus a small TTB residual — with NO misbound component and NO gate. The design engineers a validity arrangement that opens BOTH theories' non-central channels to their committed maxima, then pits their unique components head-to-head.

SETUP: 6 features, validities [0.65, 0.90, 0.55, 0.80, 0.55, 0.90]. Arrangement statistics (computed with both models' own formulas, average-tie ranks): Spearman(position, validity) = +0.088, so binding ambiguity = 0.912 — high enough that the competitor's position components dominate its mixture (normalized masses: primacy 0.573, anti-validity 0.353, recency 0.043, TTB 0.031) AND the advocated's gate product is large. Spearman(validity, validity-reversed) = -0.727, so reversal coherence = 0.727, gate = sigmoid((0.727-0.45)/0.08) = 0.970, and the advocated commits — as a PARAMETER-FREE POINT PREDICTION — to m_am = 0.912 x 0.970 = 0.884: 88.4% of subjects adopt the anti-misbound hierarchy, 11.6% the central anti-validity hierarchy, 0% primacy/recency/TTB. The competitor commits to 57.3% primacy, 35.3% anti-validity, 7.4% recency+TTB, and 0% misbound. The predicted mixture distributions have DISJOINT SUPPORTS on both the misbound and primacy masses. The validities contain exact ties (two 0.55s, two 0.90s), which switches per-cue zeta distortion OFF in BOTH models (each model's own tie-anchoring rule), making predictions sharp; and every trial keeps discriminating cues concordant within each tied group (features {f0,f2,f4} never internally oppose; {f1,f3,f5} never internally oppose), so the free tie_break parameter is inert in both models — neither gains flexibility, and the theories differ only in mixture composition plus (beta, epsilon).

THE FIVE HIERARCHIES under this arrangement: anti-validity: {f2,f4}(55%) -> f0(65%) -> f3(80%) -> {f1,f5}(90%); anti-misbound (w = -val[::-1]): {f1,f3} -> f5 -> f2 -> {f0,f4} (consulted validities 90, 80, 90, 55, 65, 55 — a genuinely scrambled, non-monotone order reducible to no validity heuristic); primacy: f0->f1->f2->f3->f4->f5; recency: f5->f4->f3->f2->f1->f0; TTB: {f1,f5} -> f3 -> f0 -> {f2,f4}. Because the strong experts (0.90, 0.90, 0.80) occupy ODD positions and the weak ones (0.55, 0.55, 0.65) EVEN positions, every trial with both groups discriminating in opposition pits the anti-misbound decider (odd group) against the anti-validity decider (even group), while the primacy and recency deciders are STEERED INDEPENDENTLY by choosing which specific features discriminate (primacy follows the earliest discriminating feature; recency the latest).

SIGNATURE 1 — PRIM-FACTOR FLATNESS (advocated) vs GRADED (competitor): trials T1, T3, T5, T7, T9, T11 all have misbound-decider -> A and anti-validity-decider -> B, but the primacy decider points to B on T1/T3/T5/T9 and to A on T7/T11, and the recency decider flips across T3/T5 (->A), T9 (->B), T11 (->B). The advocated theory has NO position components, so it predicts EXACTLY EQUAL p(A) = m_am*p_f + (1-m_am)*(1-p_f) ~= 0.67 on all six cells (p_f = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta)+eps/2 in [0.66, 0.72] in its tightened regime). The competitor predicts 0.27 (T1), 0.30 (T3), 0.30 (T5), 0.57 (T7), 0.28 (T9), 0.55 (T11) — a ~0.30 spread driven by its 57% primacy mass. The paired contrasts p(T7)-p(T3) and p(T11)-p(T9) are +0.26 under the competitor and EXACTLY ZERO under the advocated; the mirror contrasts p(T8)-p(T4) and p(T12)-p(T10) are -0.26 vs zero. A flat-vs-graded profile on a factor (position-rule decider direction) that the advocated theory is structurally blind to is the central quantitative dissociation.

SIGNATURE 2 — THE GRAND DISSOCIATION CELL (T1/T2): on T1 the anti-misbound decider (f3, the 80% expert) favors A while ALL FOUR competitor components (anti-validity via f2, primacy via f0, recency via f5, TTB via f5) favor B. Advocated: p(A) ~= 0.67 [0.62, 0.72]; competitor: p(A) = 1-p_f ~= 0.27 [0.18, 0.40] — disjoint intervals on a single cell. T2 is the exact mirror (advocated 0.33, competitor 0.73). T1 additionally separates the misbound hierarchy from validity-respecting TTB (which follows f5 to B): if the majority behavior were standard TTB rather than misbinding, choices on T1 go to B. T1 also has tally margin -3, so any margin-integrating strategy (Tallying) predicts p(A) well below 0.5 there while the advocated predicts 0.67 — the orientation-1 cells sweep margins -3, 0, +1, +2, -1, 0 with a FLAT advocated prediction, simultaneously falsifying integration strategies.

SIGNATURE 3 — POINT-PREDICTED MIXTURE MASSES: agreement cells T13-T15 (all five hierarchies concur; both theories: p_f toward the common decider) pin the follow rate p_f without knowing the mixture; the 12 dissociation cells then estimate the population hierarchy masses. The advocated uniquely predicts mass(misbound) = 0.884 and mass(primacy) = 0 for THIS arrangement — numbers derived entirely from its own ambiguity x coherence-gate formulas; the competitor predicts mass(primacy) = 0.573 and mass(misbound) = 0. Observed misbound mass > 0.2 falsifies the competitor at any parameter setting; observed primacy mass > 0.1 falsifies the advocated — a genuinely two-sided quantitative test of each theory's heterogeneity structure.

SIGNATURE 4 — PER-SUBJECT TYPE CLASSIFICATION: both theories give each subject ONE hierarchy; the 12 dissociation cells x 6 repetitions (72 trials/subject) classify subjects nearly perfectly (per-trial likelihood ratio up to (0.72/0.28)^6 per cell). Advocated: ~88% misbound-consistent, ~12% anti-validity-consistent, 0% primacy-consistent. Competitor: ~57% primacy-consistent, ~35% anti-validity-consistent, ~7% recency/TTB, 0% misbound-consistent. A single primacy-consistent subject is evidence against the advocated; a single misbound-consistent subject (beyond the ~3% TTB confound, itself resolved by T1) is evidence against the competitor.

SIGNATURE 5 — SHARED FLATNESS PROBES: T3 vs T5 (anti-validity decider f2 at depth 1 vs f0 at depth 3; misbound decider f1 at 0.90 vs f3 at 0.80) and T1 vs T3 (misbound decider f3 vs f1): both theories predict EQUAL follow rates — any depth or decider-validity gradient falsifies the one-reason core of whichever model is otherwise supported. SIGNATURE 6 — NOISE REGIME: per-subject follow-rate SD on T13-T15 discriminates the advocated's tightened regime (~0.02) from the competitor's attenuated regime (~0.06). CONTROLS: T2/T4/T6/T8/T10/T12 are exact A/B mirrors of T1/T3/T5/T7/T9/T11, ruling out side bias; T16 is a full tie (both theories: exactly 0.50) anchoring lapse rate. GLOBAL PREDICTED PROFILES: the advocated emits a two-level profile FLAT within each orientation (~0.67 on T1,T3,T5,T7,T9,T11; ~0.33 on mirrors; p_f on T13,T15; 1-p_f on T14; 0.50 on T16); the competitor emits a graded profile within each orientation (0.27-0.57 and 0.43-0.73 respectively) driven by the primacy mass. The profiles are structurally disjoint — model comparison on the 16-cell response profile separates the theories even after fitting beta, epsilon, and tie_break to each. With 16 unique pairs and K = 6 (96 trials exactly), each cell yields 6 repetitions per subject for stable per-subject choice proportions.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric is the empirical rate of choosing the option indicated by the anti-misbound hierarchy (w = -validities[::-1], consultation order {f1,f3} -> f5 -> f2 -> {f0,f4}), computed on the four trial types T1, T2, T9, T10 (24 of 96 trials per subject) where that decider points opposite to the position-primacy decider (which consults f0 first and points the other way on all four types). These four cells are chosen because they are the cells on which the two theories' UNIQUE heterogeneity channels are in maximal head-to-head conflict while the competitor's own anti-validity/recency/TTB masses cannot camouflage its primacy mass: on T1/T2 the anti-validity, recency, and TTB deciders all join primacy AGAINST the misbound decider, while on T9/T10 the anti-validity and TTB deciders join the misbound decider, so the competitor's non-primacy subjects average to exactly 0.50 on this metric and its population value is driven down to ~0.36 (57.3% primacy subjects at 1-p_f ~ 0.27, 38.4% at 0.50, 4.3% recency at 0.27). The advocated theory, with m_am = 0.912 * sigmoid((0.727-0.45)/0.08) = 0.884, predicts ~0.70 (88.4% of subjects follow the misbound decider at p_f ~ 0.73; the 11.6% anti-validity subjects average 0.50). The gap (~0.34) is large AND the per-subject spreads are tight on both sides (SD ~ 0.13 under the advocated, ~ 0.15 under the competitor, dominated by binomial noise over 24 trials plus the competitor's primacy/anti-validity mixture split), giving Welch's t at N=25 of roughly 8-9, far beyond alpha = 0.01. The deciders are recomputed inside the metric using exactly the same lexsort/weight conventions as both theories' predict functions, and a trial is admitted only if its misbound decider is identical under both tie-break conventions (the f1/f3 and f0/f4 weight ties never internally oppose on these trials, so this holds and the classification is exact and parameter-free); zeta distortion is off in both theories for this design because the validity list contains exact ties. The metric is a plain choice proportion (not a fitted quantity), works identically on the pooled DataFrame and on each single subject's 24-trial slice, is exactly mirror-balanced (T2/T10 are A/B mirrors of T1/T9) so pure side bias cancels, and its direction is diagnostic: values near 0.7 indicate an anti-misbound mixture (advocated), values near 0.35 indicate a position-primacy mixture (competitor).

**Rationale:** GOAL: Quantitatively dissociate Attenuated Frugality with Position-Validity Mixture Heterogeneity (advocated) from Distrust-Weighted Frugality with Reversal-Coherent Mixture Heterogeneity (competing). Both are one-reason models sharing the anti-validity central component, so the dissociation must come from their DIFFERENT non-central heterogeneity channels: the advocated adds position-primacy (w = -position) and position-recency (w = +position) components whose masses grow LINEARLY in binding ambiguity with NO coherence dependence; the competing adds ONLY an anti-misbound component (w = -val[::-1]) whose adoption is gated by m_am = ambiguity x sigmoid((coherence-0.45)/0.08). Prior designs [10]-[12] all operated in the HIGH-coherence regime where the gate is OPEN ([12], the same theory pair with roles swapped, used coherence 0.727 and exact validity ties). This design occupies the opposite, unexplored corner: MAXIMAL ambiguity with NEAR-ZERO reversal coherence. This directly tests the gate-vs-linear structural difference: the competitor claims non-central heterogeneity requires reversal-coherent list structure; the advocated claims position heterogeneity tracks ambiguity ALONE.

SETUP: 6 features, ALL-DISTINCT validities [0.55, 0.86, 0.78, 0.95, 0.62, 0.70] (f0..f5). Arrangement statistics (both models' own formulas, distinct ranks): Spearman(position, validity) = 3/35 = 0.086, so binding ambiguity = 0.914; Spearman(validity, validity-reversed) = 1/35 = 0.029, so the competitor's gate = sigmoid((0.029-0.45)/0.08) = 0.005, essentially SHUT. A methodological novelty: because BOTH models scale their per-cue zeta distortion by ambiguity x (coherence or gate), both zeta scales are negligible here (advocated <= 0.037, competitor <= 0.008, vs. minimum validity/position weight gaps of 0.07/1.0) - predictions are SHARP without needing exact validity ties, and the free tie_break is inert in both models (no weight ties).

PARAMETER-FREE MIXTURE COMMITMENTS: Advocated: w_prim = 0.80x0.914, w_anti = 0.45, w_rec = 0.06x0.914, w_ttb = 0.04 -> normalized masses PRIMACY 0.573, ANTI-VALIDITY 0.353, RECENCY 0.043, TTB 0.031, MISBOUND 0. Competitor: m_am = 0.914 x 0.005 = 0.0047 -> ANTI-VALIDITY 0.995, MISBOUND 0.005, POSITION COMPONENTS 0 (structurally absent). The predicted type distributions have disjoint supports on the primacy mass (0.573 vs 0).

THE FIVE HIERARCHIES: ANTI (ascending validity): f0(.55) -> f4(.62) -> f5(.70) -> f2(.78) -> f1(.86) -> f3(.95). PRIMACY: f0 -> f1 -> f2 -> f3 -> f4 -> f5. RECENCY: f5 -> f4 -> f3 -> f2 -> f1 -> f0. TTB: f3 -> f1 -> f2 -> f5 -> f4 -> f0. MISBOUND: f2 -> f4 -> f3 -> f0 -> f1 -> f5. Crucially, ANTI and PRIMACY share f0 as top cue, so every dissociation trial keeps f0 TIED, forcing consultation to depth >= 2 where the two orders diverge: primacy's second cue is the 2nd-listed 86% expert f1, anti-validity's is the 5th-listed 62% expert f4.

SIGNATURE 1 - DIRECTION-FLIP DISSOCIATION GRID WITH DISJOINT INTERVALS (T1-T10): on T1/T3/T5 the earliest discriminator (f1/f2/f3, positions 1-3, validities 0.78-0.95) favors A while the weakest discriminator f4 (position 5, 62%) favors B; on T7/T9 the weakest discriminator is f5 (position 6, 70%). Deciders on every one of these cells: PRIMACY and TTB -> the early/strong cue; ANTI-VALIDITY, RECENCY, and MISBOUND -> the weak/late cue. Advocated: p(A) = 0.604*p_f + 0.396*(1-p_f) in [0.532, 0.567] (above 0.5 for ANY parameters). Competitor: p(A) = 1 - p_f (+0.005 misbound tilt on T3/T7/T9) in [0.208, 0.344] (below 0.5 for ANY parameters). THE INTERVALS ARE DISJOINT AND ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF 0.5 ON ALL TEN CELLS: the sign of the population preference on any single cell falsifies one theory at any parameter setting. T2/T4/T6/T8/T10 are exact A/B mirrors ruling out side bias. The grid also sweeps primacy-decider depth (2, 3, 4) and validity (0.78-0.95) and anti-decider identity (f4 vs f5): both theories predict a FLAT follow rate across the sweep - a shared one-reason flatness probe.

SIGNATURE 2 - THE PRIMACY-FLIP PAIRED CONTRAST, EXACTLY ZERO VS STRONGLY POSITIVE (T1/T5 vs T11, T2/T6 vs T12): T11 (f4->B, f5->A) has the IDENTICAL anti-validity and misbound deciders as T1/T5 (anti f4->B, mis f4->B), so the competitor predicts p(T11) = p(T1) = p(T5) EXACTLY (both = 1 - p_f) - it is structurally blind to the fact that the primacy, recency, and TTB deciders all flipped. The advocated predicts p(T1) - p(T11) = 0.530*(2*p_f - 1) in [0.165, 0.341]. The paired within-subject contrast is 0 (competitor) vs >= 0.165 (advocated) - disjoint. Mirrors give the symmetric negative contrast. This flat-vs-graded profile on a factor the competitor cannot represent is the central quantitative dissociation.

SIGNATURE 3 - THE ANTI-FLIP SWING MAGNITUDE (T13 vs T1): T13 (f1->A, f3->B) holds the primacy decider fixed (f1->A) while flipping the anti-validity decider (f1->A instead of f4->B). Competitor swing p(T13)-p(T1) = 1.98*p_f - 0.995 in [0.306, 0.577]; advocated swing = 0.644*p_f - 0.322 in [0.100, 0.208]. DISJOINT INTERVALS: the anti-flip swing alone separates the theories. Combined with Signature 2, the two swing magnitudes form a double dissociation: the competitor demands anti-flip swing (>= 0.31) >> primacy-flip swing (= 0); the advocated demands primacy-flip swing (>= 0.165) > anti-flip swing (<= 0.208), reflecting its 57/35 primacy-vs-anti mass split against the competitor's 99.5/0.5.

SIGNATURE 4 - PER-SUBJECT TYPE CLASSIFICATION (the sharpest test): 11 dissociation cells (T1-T10, T15) x 6 repetitions = 66 trials/subject. The competitor predicts ~99.5% of subjects are anti-validity-consistent (always following the weakest-advertised discriminator, f4 or f5); the advocated predicts only ~35% anti-consistent, ~57% PRIMACY-consistent (always following the earliest-listed discriminator), ~7% recency/TTB. A single primacy-consistent subject is strong evidence against the competitor (which assigns position rules zero mass); a near-100% anti-consistent sample falsifies the advocated's point-predicted 0.573 primacy mass - a genuinely two-sided test of each theory's heterogeneity structure at a parameter-free commitment.

SIGNATURE 5 - TTB CONFOUND GUARDS AND CONTROLS: T13/T14 are agreement cells (both theories ~0.69-0.72 toward the early cue f1) where standard validity-respecting TTB follows the 95% expert f3 the OTHER way - if subjects were TTB, p(T13) ~ 0.28, falsifying both target theories while validating the anti-validity claim shared by both. T15 pits PRIMACY ALONE (f1->A) against ANTI + RECENCY + TTB + MISBOUND (f3/f4->B): advocated p(A) = 0.573*p_f + 0.427*(1-p_f) in [0.523, 0.547] vs competitor 1 - p_f in [0.208, 0.344] - disjoint, and simultaneously separating primacy-following from strong-expert-following. T16 (full tie) pins both theories to exactly 0.50, anchoring lapse and side bias. The noise regimes also differ: per-subject follow-rate SD on the agreement cells (T13/T14) is ~0.02 under the competitor's tightened regime vs ~0.06 under the advocated's attenuated regime.

GLOBAL PREDICTED PROFILES (p_f ~ 0.72): Advocated: p(A) ~ 0.546 on T1,T3,T5,T7,T9; ~0.454 on T2,T4,T6,T8,T10; 0.312 on T11/T14; 0.688 on T12/T13; 0.532 on T15; 0.500 on T16. Competitor: ~0.28 on T1,T3,T5,T7,T9,T11,T15; ~0.72 on T2,T4,T6,T8,T10,T12,T13; ~0.28 on T14; 0.500 on T16. The competitor emits a two-level step function constant across ALL cells sharing its (anti, misbound) decider pair - in particular p(T1)=p(T11)=p(T15) exactly - while the advocated emits a graded profile on those same cells driven by its primacy mass. Model comparison on the 16-cell response profile separates the theories even after fitting beta, epsilon, and tie_break to each. With 16 unique pairs and K = 6 (96 trials exactly), each cell yields 6 repetitions per subject for stable per-subject choice proportions.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Both theories are one-reason models sharing the anti-validity central order, so pooled single-cell contrasts are nearly collinear (their predicted p(A) profiles differ by at most ~0.13 on any cell). The real dispute is the STRUCTURE of between-subject heterogeneity: the advocated theory says a large position-primacy mass enters linearly with binding ambiguity (here ~36% of subjects consult experts in reading order), while the competing theory says heterogeneity is only anti-validity vs anti-misbound re-encoding, with position rules structurally absent. The metric therefore classifies each subject's consultation order from two cell families and returns the excess of primacy-type over validity-respecting-type subjects.

Family 1 (trials whose discriminating-cue sets are {f1,f4}, {f2,f4}, {f1,f5}, {f1,f3}, {f1,f3,f4}: T1-T4, T7-T8, T13, T15, 48 trials/subject): the earliest-listed discriminating expert opposes every later one, so primacy readers and anti-validity readers pick opposite options. Family 2 (sets {f3,f4}, {f3,f5}: T5-T6, T9-T10, 24 trials/subject): the earliest-listed discriminating expert is the weak 62% expert f3, so primacy readers now OPPOSE both the anti-validity readers and any descending-validity/anti-misbound reader. A subject following the earliest-listed expert on BOTH families is a pure position-primacy type (+1); one following it on Family 1 but reversing on Family 2 has a validity-respecting order (-1); anti-validity subjects score 0.

Predicted values (following probabilities p_f in 0.69-0.73 give clean 0.27/0.73 per-cell rates, far from the 0.5 classification threshold over 48/24 trials):
- Advocated: ~36% primacy-type subjects (+1), ~5% TTB-type (-1), ~59% anti/recency (0) -> metric ~ +0.31, per-subject SD ~ 0.56.
- Competitor: 0% primacy-type (position rules have zero mass); its ~36% anti-misbound subjects follow the early cue on Family 1 but the weak cue on Family 2 (-1), its ~64% anti-validity subjects score 0 -> metric ~ -0.36, per-subject SD ~ 0.48.

Welch t at N=25: t ~ 4.6 (p < 1e-4), comfortably below alpha=0.01, because the supports of the primacy-type mass are disjoint (0.36 vs 0) and the validity-type mass differs 7-fold in the opposite direction (0.05 vs 0.36). The contrast is also robust to the alternative all-distinct validity arrangement ([0.55,0.86,0.78,0.95,0.62,0.70]): there the advocated yields ~ +0.57 (57% primacy-type) vs ~ -0.01 for the competitor (gate shut, ~100% anti-validity, all scoring 0), t ~ 5.8. The metric is well-defined on a single subject's slice (score in {-1,0,+1}), so between-subject variance is always available, and it uses only stimulus-derived quantities (discriminating-cue positions), so it is invariant to any A/B label randomization.

    """
    Primacy-type excess vs validity-respecting-type excess.

    Two cell families are selected by their discriminating-cue sets
    (feature positions where the two options' ratings differ):

    Family 1 ("early-cue cells"; design trials T1-T4, T7-T8, T13, T15):
        sets {1,4}, {2,4}, {1,5}, {1,3}, {1,3,4}. The earliest-listed
        discriminating expert (f1 or f2) favors the opposite option from
        every later discriminating expert, so a position-primacy reader
        and an anti-validity (weakest-first) reader pick opposite options.

    Family 2 ("weak-cue cells"; design trials T5-T6, T9-T10):
        sets {3,4}, {3,5}. The earliest-listed discriminating expert is
        the low-validity f3, opposing f4/f5, so primacy and anti-validity
        readers disagree here as well, but a descending-validity (TTB-like
        or anti-misbound) reader now sides with the anti-validity reader.

    Per subject: X1 = rate of choosing the earliest-cue option on
    Family 1, X2 = same on Family 2. Score = +1 if the subject follows
    the earliest-listed expert on BOTH families (pure position-primacy
    consultation order), -1 if it follows it on Family 1 but reverses on
    Family 2 (validity-respecting order), 0 otherwise. The metric is the
    mean score: the excess of primacy-type subjects over
    validity-respecting-type subjects.

    Anti-misbound decider-follow rate on hierarchy-dissociating cells.

    For each trial we compute the option picked by the competitor's
    hierarchy (weakest-advertised-expert-first: cues sorted by ASCENDING
    validity, ties by display position) and the option picked by the
    advocated theory's anti-misbound re-encoding (w = -val[::-1],
    consulted in descending subjective weight, which is equivalent to
    sorting cues by ASCENDING val[::-1], ties by display position), using
    the experiment's validities [0.80, 0.55, 0.90, 0.55, 0.80, 0.65].

    On this design the two hierarchies' first discriminating cues point to
    OPPOSITE options on 13 of the 16 unique pairs (T1-T13) and agree on
    T14/T15 (T16 is a full tie). The deciders are invariant to either
    theory's free tie_break parameter because no trial opposes two cues
    tied within a hierarchy group. The metric is the proportion of
    choices that follow the anti-misbound decider on those 13
    dissociating cells only.

    Predicted values:
      - Weakest-Expert-First (competing): subjects follow their own
        (central) decider with p_f ~ 0.70, hence follow the anti-misbound
        decider with ~0.30.
      - Advocated: ~95% of subjects are anti-misbinders (m_am =
    ambiguity x coherence-gate ~ 0.95 for this arrangement), so the
        follow rate toward the anti-misbound decider is ~0.70.
    The two theories therefore sit on opposite sides of 0.50 with a
    ~0.40 gap, while per-subject values are tight (each subject
    contributes 13 cells x 6 reps = 78 dissociating trials).

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.

  "interpretation": "Across all 14 experiments, pi_6 (Attenuated Frugality with Position-Validity Mixture Heterogeneity) is the quantitatively better of the two theories, but both carry serious, structural failures \u2014 and pi_5's central mechanism has been decisively falsified by its own experiment.\n\nPer-experiment scorecard (|predicted - observed|):\n- Exp 1 (pi_5's own adversarial test): pi_5 predicted 0.654, pi_6 predicted 0.242, observed 0.150. This is a catastrophic failure for pi_5: its parameter-free commitment of an 88.4% anti-misbound mass implies a follow rate near 0.70, and the observed rate (0.15) is not merely low \u2014 it lies BELOW even pi_6's prediction, meaning subjects systematically OPPOSED the anti-misbound decider. The reversal-coherent mixture gate \u2014 pi_5's distinctive contribution \u2014 is refuted in the exact regime (high ambiguity, high coherence) where it was supposed to dominate.\n- Exp 2 (pi_6's own adversarial test): pi_5 predicted -0.36, pi_6 predicted +0.16, observed exactly 0.000 (var=0.0000). Both miss, but pi_6 misses its OWN design: not a single subject classified as a pure primacy type or a pure validity-respecting type. This falsifies pi_6's discrete 57%-primacy mass as much as it falsifies pi_5's misbound mass \u2014 the population shows no clean rule types at all.\n- Exps 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13: pi_6 closer on all seven (e.g., Exp 6: 0.789 vs observed 0.779, while pi_5 says 0.896; Exp 13: 0.465 vs observed 0.490, pi_5 says 0.426).\n- Exps 5, 7, 9: pi_5 closer (e.g., Exp 7: 0.631 vs observed 0.613; Exp 9: -0.233 vs observed -0.311). But these are designs where both theories reduce to near-anti-validity one-reason behavior, so pi_5's wins here come from its shared core, not from its distinctive misbound mechanism.\n- Exp 12: both predict ~184 vs observed 116.56 \u2014 a shared, large overprediction of conformity/dispersion, indicating both theories' assumed follow probability (p_f ~ 0.72) is too high.\n- Exp 14: both overpredict by ~0.06 (0.59 vs observed 0.53) \u2014 again shared attenuation failure.\n\nTally: pi_6 closer on 8 experiments, pi_5 on 3, ties on 3. pi_6 is the better theory, but the pattern of failures is diagnostic of something BOTH get wrong: (a) observed decider-follow rates are consistently weaker than either theory assumes (Exps 1, 8, 12, 14 all show overprediction of conformity); (b) heterogeneity is NOT organized into discrete, learnable rule types \u2014 Exp 1 shows no misbound mass, Exp 2 shows zero pure primacy or validity types with literally zero between-subject variance. Both theories' signature claim \u2014 that subjects draw one of a small family of discrete consultation orders \u2014 is contradicted by the two experiments specifically engineered to detect those types. What survives everywhere is the shared core: one-reason decision making with flat psychometric slopes over tally margins (Exps 3, 6, 7, 8, 10) and an anti-validity (distrust-the-weakest) central tendency (Exps 2, 5, 9, 13).\n\nSince pi_5 is degenerate \u2014 its only distinctive mechanism was tested head-on and produced a sign-level error \u2014 regenerating its parameters cannot rescue it (no parameter setting of an 88%-misbound gate yields an observed 0.15). The right move is to replace pi_5 with a brand-new theory that keeps the empirically supported core (one-reason, anti-validity central, margin-0 flatness) and replaces discrete mixture heterogeneity with continuous, low-amplitude heterogeneity plus attenuated response discipline. This yields a genuine competitor to pi_6 that can explain the full record, including the two experiments where pi_6 itself fails.",

  "recommendation": "Replace pi_5 with a new theory \u2014 'Anti-Validity Frugality with Diffuse Positional-Salience Heterogeneity' \u2014 built as follows.\n\nCore (retained from what the data support): subjects are one-reason decision makers; cues are consulted one at a time in descending subjective weight and the first strictly discriminating cue decides; no integration across cues (flat profile over tally margins, matching Exps 3, 6, 7, 8, 10). The population-central subjective hierarchy is anti-validity (distrust-the-weakest, w = -validity).\n\nHeterogeneity (replaces BOTH theories' discrete mixtures): each subject's subjective weights are a continuous perturbation of the anti-validity order, w_j = -val_j + gamma * salience_j + zeta_j, where (i) salience_j is a small positional-salience gradient favoring early-listed experts (e.g., salience_j \u221d (n_features - j)), with gamma a per-subject draw, zero-centered across the population with modest SD \u2014 position affects behavior only as a graded tilt, never as a discrete 'primacy' or 'recency' rule; (ii) zeta_j is per-cue idiosyncratic distortion (zero-centered, fixed per subject), scaled smoothly by binding ambiguity (1 - |Spearman(position, validity)|) and only when all validities are distinct. NO reversal re-encoding (no anti-misbound component \u2014 directly falsified by Exp 1), NO sigmoid coherence gates, NO discrete component draws. This continuous structure predicts: Exp 1's low anti-misbound follow rate (all mass opposes the scrambled order); Exp 2's exactly-zero type excess with zero variance (perturbed anti-validity subjects follow the weak/late cues on Family 1, so x1 \u2264 0.5 and every subject scores 0 \u2014 no pure types exist by construction); and graded, design-dependent dispersion elsewhere.\n\nResponse discipline (fixes the shared conformity overprediction): attenuated and heterogeneous follow probability p_f = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2 with population mean ~0.60-0.63 and per-subject SD ~0.08-0.10 (visibly below both current theories' ~0.72), which corrects the systematic overpredictions on Exps 1, 8, 12, and 14 (e.g., Exp 12's conformity-dispersion index drops from ~184 toward the observed ~117). Noise remains softmax(beta) over the binary winner score plus an independent lapse epsilon; no discriminating cue yields exactly 0.5; history is ignored. Validity ties broken by a free per-subject tie-break.\n\nThis new theory is a stronger competitor to pi_6 than pi_5 ever was: it matches pi_6's successes via the shared anti-validity one-reason core, and it explains the two experiments pi_6 fails (Exp 2's zero pure-type excess and the attenuated conformity levels) through continuous rather than discrete heterogeneity and a lower response-discipline regime."
