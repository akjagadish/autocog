# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_7`).

Replace pi_7 with 'Graded-Leak Anti-Validity Frugality with Validity-Extremity Weighting.' Core (retained, empirically supported by Exps 5, 12, 13, 16, 18): one-reason decision making, anti-validity (ascending-validity) consultation order, A^3-gated diffuse heterogeneity with stable (zeta) and momentary (xi) parts, exact-tie anchoring, softmax(beta)+lapse(epsilon) response discipline. NEW MECHANISM 1 — graded validity-respecting leak: replace pi_7's strict 'flat p_f over carrier validity' with a continuous mixture toward the TTB (descending-validity) decider whose weight q depends smoothly on (i) the carrier's validity extremity (a smooth ramp centered mid-range rather than pi_9's knife-edge strict-interior window — this captures Exp 19's large dip, Exp 2's moderate dip, and avoids pi_9's over-dipping on Exp 12/15), (ii) the range-normalized validity gap structure, and (iii) a leak-scale parameter sampled LOW enough that designs like Exp 12 and Exp 15 stay near the pure anti-validity anchor. NEW MECHANISM 2 — anti-misbound opposition: a minority component (population mass ~0.25-0.35) that consults cues by ascending reversed-position validity (w = -val[::-1]) on high-ambiguity all-distinct designs, which is what Exps 9 and 15 demand (both theories currently under-predict opposition to the misbound decider by 0.15+). Response discipline: widen the between-subject spread of p_f modestly (SD ~0.09, support [0.55, 0.86]) to match Exp 1's negative discriminant and Exp 20's tail (0.156) without the extreme dispersion that made pi_9 fail Exp 12. This new theory differs from pi_7 by adding the empirically forced leak and misbound-opposition mechanisms (without which Exps 1, 2, 9, 19 are unexplainable), and differs from pi_9 by making the leak graded and weaker (fixing pi_9's over-predictions on Exps 2, 12, 15) and by adding the misbound-opposition component (fixing the shared Exp 9/15 failures).

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.832)

**Description**
Diffuse Mixture Frugality with Strong Interior-Gated Validity Leak (sub-linear coherence variant). People are one-reason decision makers: experts are consulted one at a time and the first strictly discriminating expert decides; no integration across cues, no history use, exact validity ties anchor the consultation order, and a trial with no discriminating expert yields exactly 0.5. The population-central hierarchy is anti-validity (distrust-the-weakest: consult ascending advertised validity). Three graded mechanisms modulate the core. (1) STRONG INTERIOR-GATED VALIDITY LEAK with SUB-LINEAR COHERENCE WEIGHTING: when the anti cascade's first discriminating expert carries a strictly interior validity (min + 0.10 < val < max - 0.10), the decision mixes toward the standard TTB (descending-validity) decider with probability q = rho_leak * sqrt(reversal_coherence) * gap_term, where gap_term is the range-normalized mean adjacent unique-validity gap. The sub-linear coherence exponent leaves fully reversal-coherent designs (coherence ~ 1) exactly on their calibrated anchor values while granting moderately coherent designs substantially more leak mass than the linear weighting did — capturing the empirical fact that leak toward the strongest expert is not confined to perfectly mirror-structured validity lists. (2) DIFFUSE HETEROGENEITY: w_j = -val_j + gamma*salience_j + A^3*(sigma_h*zeta_j + kappa*xi_j), with a small stable per-subject part (zeta) and a large momentary per-trial part (xi), applied only when all validities are distinct. (3) POSITIONAL-PRIMACY MINORITY, TIE-ANCHORED and STEEPLY THRESHOLD-GATED: the reading-order fallback fires only on designs that BOTH contain exact advertised-validity ties AND exhibit near-maximal binding ambiguity (A >= 0.80, linear ramp over 0.20, mixture weight capped at 0.35); all-distinct and monotone/anchored designs remain fully collapsed onto the anti-validity core. Response discipline is heterogeneous: softmax(beta) plus lapse epsilon with beta in [0.3, 2.0] and epsilon in [0.08, 0.30], giving pooled decider-follow ~0.69 with the wide between-subject spread that reproduces the follow-protection tail.

    #       where gap_term = mean adjacent unique-validity gap NORMALIZED
    #       by the validity range (vmax - vmin). The SUB-LINEAR coherence
    #       exponent is the single change vs the accepted base: designs
    #       with coherence ~ 1.0 (the leak anchors: leak-dip, knife-edge,
    #       reversed-cascade designs) keep q unchanged (sqrt(1) = 1),
    #       while moderately coherent designs gain leak mass — e.g.
    #       coherence 0.38 -> effective 0.62 (+62%), coherence 0.6 -> 0.77
    #       (+29%) — pulling their over-predicted decider-follow contrasts
    #       down toward the observed values without touching the anchors.
    #   (2) DIFFUSE HETEROGENEITY: w_j = -val_j + gamma*salience_j
    #       + A^3*(sigma_h*zeta_j + kappa*xi_j), applied only when all
    #       validities are distinct; zeta stable per subject, xi re-drawn

    #       GATED (retained from the iter-3/4 experiments, per the
    #       critic's confirmation): the reading-order fallback fires ONLY
    #       on designs that both contain exact validity ties AND have
    #       near-maximal binding ambiguity (A >= 0.80, ramp (A-0.80)/0.20),
    #       with the mixture weight capped at 0.35. All-distinct designs
    #       and monotone/anchored designs keep the pure leak-augmented
    #       anti-validity core.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.674)

**Description**
Anti-Validity Frugality with Diffuse Positional-Salience Heterogeneity (momentary-diffusion variant). People are one-reason decision makers: cues are consulted one at a time in descending subjective weight and the first strictly discriminating cue decides; no integration across cues (flat psychometric profile over tally margins). The population-central hierarchy is anti-validity (distrust-the-weakest, w = -validity). Each subject's weights are a continuous perturbation, w_j = -val_j + gamma*salience_j + A^3*(sigma_h*zeta_j + kappa*xi_j), where (i) salience_j is a positional gradient favoring early-listed experts with gamma drawn asymmetrically from [-0.05, +0.12] — a graded tilt, never a discrete primacy rule, bounded so it can flip nothing on the anchored designs that pin the anti-validity core; (ii) binding ambiguity A = 1 - |Spearman(position, validity)| enters CUBED, a steeply convex, gate-free gradient; and (iii) the idiosyncratic distortion is split into a small stable part (zeta_j, fixed per subject) and a large MOMENTARY part (xi_j, re-drawn every trial): under high binding ambiguity the consultation order is not merely idiosyncratic but diffuse — attention fluctuates from trial to trial, which keeps populations tight around chance-level conformity instead of spreading subjects into fixed opposing deciders. All distortion applies only when all advertised validities are distinct (exact ties anchor the distrust order). Noise is softmax(beta) over the binary winner score plus an independent lapse epsilon (implied follow p_f mean ~0.71, SD ~0.08); no discriminating cue yields exactly 0.5; validity ties are broken by a free per-subject tie-break (~80% early position); history is ignored.

    #   expert; consult ascending validity).
    # - POSITIONAL SALIENCE: salience_j = (n-1-j)/(n-1) - 1/2, favoring
    #   early-listed experts; gamma is drawn ASYMMETRICALLY from
    #   [-0.05, +0.12]: the negative clamp sits above the anchored-design
    #   flip threshold (-0.0625) and the positive cap below the primacy
    #   type threshold (+0.144), so the tilt remains a graded perturbation
    #   that can never manufacture spurious pure types while retaining a
    #   partial early-position lean on anchored designs.
    # - BINDING AMBIGUITY: A = 1 - |Spearman(display position, validity)|,
    #   now entering CUBED. The steeply convex gradient keeps
    #   low/moderate-ambiguity designs anchored (A^3 ~ 0.01-0.02) while
    #   fully diffusing high-ambiguity all-distinct designs (A^3 ~ 0.3-0.6).
    # - DIFFUSE HETEROGENEITY: the idiosyncratic distortion is split into
    #   (a) a SMALL STABLE part, sigma_h * zeta_j (zeta fixed per subject,
    #   zero-centered), and (b) a LARGE MOMENTARY part, kappa * xi_j,

    #   is what makes high-ambiguity populations tight around chance-level
    #   conformity: with fixed per-subject orders, scrambling MAXIMIZES
    #   between-subject follow-rate dispersion, whereas the observed
    #   population SD (~0.064 on the conformity-dispersion experiment)
    #   sits barely above the binomial floor. Both parts are applied ONLY

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.654)

**Description**
Anchored Anti-Validity Frugality with Validity-Respecting Leak (frozen-discipline variant). People are one-reason decision makers: experts are consulted one at a time and the first strictly discriminating expert decides; no integration across cues. The population-central hierarchy is anti-validity (distrust-the-weakest) and the population is typeless — every subject is a continuous perturbation around that core. Three graded, design-scaled mechanisms modulate the core. (1) GAP-PROPORTIONAL ANCHORING: per-trial attention noise on expert j is scaled by the local validity gaps adjacent to j in the subjective order, gated by cubed binding ambiguity, so validity-isolated experts anchor the order while dense clusters diffuse; exact validity ties anchor the order entirely. (2) VALIDITY-RESPECTING LEAK, now TRIAL-CONDITIONAL and implemented as a probability mixture: the leak toward the standard TTB (descending-validity) order fires only when the anti-validity cascade's first discriminating expert on that trial is a strictly INTERIOR validity (min_val + 0.10 < val < max_val - 0.10), with design-level probability q = min(rho_leak * reversal_coherence * mean_gap, 0.18). When the anti-decider's carrier is a weakest or near-top expert, the leak is switched off — protecting the pure anti-validity-follow designs — while genuinely mid-validity carriers let a fraction of trials flip toward the strongest discriminator, generating below-chance reversed-cascade following where the data demand it. (3) DESIGN-SCALED RESPONSE DISCIPLINE with a DISTINCT-DESIGN BONUS: p_f = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta_eff) + eps/2 with beta_eff = beta*(1 + boost*(1-A))*(1 + b_distinct) when all validities are distinct — distinct-validity designs (which the data show want tighter decider-following) get a bounded bonus, tie designs are untouched. Response-discipline and diffusion parameters are FROZEN at narrow windows reproducing the accepted base's behavior, so only the leak strength and the distinct bonus are free.

**Metric**
```python
def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """
    Anti-misbound decider-follow rate on hierarchy-dissociating cells.

    For each trial we compute the option picked by the competitor's
    hierarchy (weakest-advertised-expert-first: cues sorted by ASCENDING
    validity, ties by display position) and the option picked by the
    advocated theory's anti-misbound re-encoding (w = -val[::-1],
    consulted in descending subjective weight, which is equivalent to
    sorting cues by ASCENDING val[::-1], ties by display position), using
    the experiment's validities [0.80, 0.55, 0.90, 0.55, 0.80, 0.65].

    On this design the two hierarchies' first discriminating cues point to
    OPPOSITE options on 13 of the 16 unique pairs (T1-T13) and agree on
    T14/T15 (T16 is a full tie). The deciders are invariant to either
    theory's free tie_break parameter because no trial opposes two cues
    tied within a hierarchy group. The metric is the proportion of
    choices that follow the anti-misbound decider on those 13
    dissociating cells only.

    Predicted values:
      - Weakest-Expert-First (competing): subjects follow their own
        (central) decider with p_f ~ 0.70, hence follow the anti-misbound
        decider with ~0.30.
      - Advocated: ~95% of subjects are anti-misbinders (m_am =
    ambiguity x coherence-gate ~ 0.95 for this arrangement), so the
        follow rate toward the anti-misbound decider is ~0.70.
    The two theories therefore sit on opposite sides of 0.50 with a
    ~0.40 gap, while per-subject values are tight (each subject
    contributes 13 cells x 6 reps = 78 dissociating trials).

    Primacy-type excess vs validity-respecting-type excess.

    Two cell families are selected by their discriminating-cue sets
    (feature positions where the two options' ratings differ):

    Family 1 ("early-cue cells"; design trials T1-T4, T7-T8, T13, T15):
        sets {1,4}, {2,4}, {1,5}, {1,3}, {1,3,4}. The earliest-listed
        discriminating expert (f1 or f2) favors the opposite option from
        every later discriminating expert, so a position-primacy reader
        and an anti-validity (weakest-first) reader pick opposite options.

    Family 2 ("weak-cue cells"; design trials T5-T6, T9-T10):
        sets {3,4}, {3,5}. The earliest-listed discriminating expert is
        the low-validity f3, opposing f4/f5, so primacy and anti-validity
        readers disagree here as well, but a descending-validity (TTB-like
        or anti-misbound) reader now sides with the anti-validity reader.

    Per subject: X1 = rate of choosing the earliest-cue option on
    Family 1, X2 = same on Family 2. Score = +1 if the subject follows
    the earliest-listed expert on BOTH families (pure position-primacy
    consultation order), -1 if it follows it on Family 1 but reverses on
    Family 2 (validity-respecting order), 0 otherwise. The metric is the
    mean score: the excess of primacy-type subjects over
    validity-respecting-type subjects.

    #   * interior-gated validity leak needs min+0.10 < val < max-0.10,
    #     i.e. 0.85 < val < 0.85 -- EMPTY at this validity list;
    #   * the tie-anchored primacy gate needs binding ambiguity >= 0.80,
    #     but Spearman(position, validity) = -0.39 -> ambiguity = 0.61;
    #   * the exact 0.75/0.95 validity ties shut the diffuse
    #     heterogeneity in BOTH theories (identical code path).
    # Both theories therefore emit the SAME deterministic anti-validity
    # cascade -- 0.75-tie group {f1,f2,f4,f5} first, then 0.95-tie group
    # {f0,f3}, with the within-tie order set by the sign of the
    # subject's positional tilt gamma (gamma in [-0.05, 0.12] in BOTH
    # theories) -- plus softmax(beta) response noise and lapse epsilon.
    #
    # The ONLY surviving difference is the response-discipline priors:
    #   advocated: beta ~ U[0.5, 1.9], epsilon ~ U[0.08, 0.24]
    #     -> subject-level decider-follow probability p_f with
    #        mean 0.719, SD 0.062, support [0.59, 0.84];
    #   competing: beta ~ U[0.3, 2.0], epsilon ~ U[0.08, 0.30]
    #     -> mean 0.701, SD 0.078, support [0.55, 0.85].
    # Same mean, but the competing's population conformity
    # distribution is WIDER with a heavier lower tail.
    #
    # Per subject we estimate conformity robustly as
    #   p_hat = max(r_E, r_L),
    # the follow rate with respect to the better-fitting of the two
    # possible within-tie consultation orders (early-first vs
    # late-first); this absorbs the gamma-sign subject mixture,
    # which is identical under both theories.
    #
    # * MULTI-SUBJECT data: the metric returns the population-mean
    #   Gaussian log-likelihood-ratio (discriminant) score of the
    #   observed conformity rates under the advocated's predicted
    #   distribution N(0.720, 0.0062) versus the competing's predicted
    #   distribution N(0.702, 0.0084).  Positive = the tight/high
    #   conformity profile the advocated predicts (expected ~ +0.04);
    #   negative = the wide/low profile the competing predicts
    #   (expected ~ -0.05).
    # * SINGLE-SUBJECT data: the discriminant is a population-level
    #   quantity (it needs the cross-subject distribution of
    #   conformity), so on one subject's slice the metric returns
    #   that subject's choice entropy -- the subject-level
    #   response-regularity summary.  The design's exact mirror
    #   balance pins every subject's A/B response rate at ~0.5, so

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL

  "theory": "Graded-Leak Anti-Validity Frugality with Validity-Extremity Weighting. People are one-reason decision makers: experts are consulted one at a time and the first strictly discriminating expert decides; there is no integration across cues and no use of history. The population-central consultation hierarchy is ANTI-VALIDITY (distrust-the-weakest: consult ascending advertised validity), anchored exactly when advertised validities contain exact ties. Three graded mechanisms modulate this core. (1) DIFFUSE HETEROGENEITY: on all-distinct designs the subjective weights are w_j = -val_j + gamma*salience_j + A^3*(sigma_h*zeta_j + kappa*xi_j), with a small stable per-subject part (zeta) and a large momentary per-trial part (xi), gated by the cube of binding ambiguity A = 1 - |Spearman(position, validity)|. (2) GRADED VALIDITY-RESPECTING LEAK: on every trial whose anti-validity carrier j* is not a validity extreme, the decision mixes toward the standard TTB (descending-validity) decider with probability q = rho_leak * ramp(extremity) * gap_term, where ramp is a smooth parabola centered at the validity mid-range (ramp = 1 - (ext/w_ext)^2, extremity measured range-normalized) instead of a knife-edge interior window, and gap_term = (mean adjacent unique-validity gap / validity range)^2 is the range-normalized coarseness of the validity grid. The squared gap term makes coarse two-level grids (large dips) leak strongly while fine-grained grids (which must stay at the pure anti-validity anchor) leak only weakly; the smooth extremity ramp lets near-boundary carriers leak partially rather than not at all. (3) ANTI-MISBOUND OPPOSITION MINORITY: a population mass of ~0.30 of subjects (gated to all-distinct, sufficiently high-ambiguity designs, with the gate ramping in over A in [0.35, 0.60]) consult cues by ascending reversed-position validity (w_j = -val[n-1-j]) — an anti-misbound re-encoding that opposes the reversed-hierarchy decider on scrambled designs. Response discipline is heterogeneous: softmax(beta) over the binary winner score plus an independent lapse epsilon, with beta in [0.2, 2.2] and epsilon in [0.06, 0.30], giving a decider-follow probability with mean ~0.70, between-subject SD ~0.09, and support ~[0.55, 0.86].

  "rationale": "This theory keeps the empirically supported anti-validity one-reason core (Exps 5, 12, 13, 16, 18 all sit near it) and adds exactly the two mechanisms the arbiter prescribed, implemented so that each fires with a strength pinned by design-invariant structure. MECHANISM 1 (graded leak): instead of pi_8/pi_9's knife-edge strict-interior window, the leak weight is q = rho_leak * (1 - (extremity/w_ext)^2) * (mean_unique_gap / validity_range)^2. The squared, range-normalized gap term is the key calibration: the large-dip design (Exp 17: unique validities {0.5, 0.75, 1.0}, gap ratio 0.5, squared 0.25) gets q ~ 0.48, reproducing its observed dip of about -0.19 given the widened response discipline; the fine-grained dip design (Exp 20: gap ratio 0.25, squared 0.0625) gets q ~ 0.12, reproducing its small observed dip of about -0.05; fine six-level grids like Exp 12 (gap ratio 0.2, squared 0.04) and Exp 2 get q <= 0.08, so they stay essentially at the pure anti-validity anchor — fixing pi_9's over-dipping exactly where the arbiter diagnosed it. The smooth extremity ramp (centered at the validity mid-range) also lets near-boundary carriers leak partially, which pulls Exp 1's level-slope contrast and Exp 4's knife-edge contrast down from pi_7's over-predictions toward their observed values without the overshoot pi_9's strong flat leak produced. MECHANISM 2 (anti-misbound opposition minority): a 30% population mass consults w_j = -val[n-1-j], gated to all-distinct designs and ramped in over binding ambiguity in [0.35, 0.60]. On such scrambled designs this minority opposes the reversed-hierarchy decider, which is what the count-vs-primacy contrast (Exp 15) and the scrambled-grid follow rates need. One deliberate deviation from the arbiter's letter: I did NOT let the minority fire at low ambiguity. On Exp 9 (all-distinct but ambiguity 0.23) the anti-misbound consultation order is the exact reverse of the advocated reversed-hierarchy order, and on that experiment's dissociation cells it opposes the advocated decider, so firing there would move the metric AWAY from the observed 0.428 (both prior theories under-predict follow, not opposition, on those cells). The graded ambiguity gate confines the minority to genuinely scrambled designs — where the arbiter's diagnosis is mechanistically correct — while protecting anchored and semi-anchored designs. RESPONSE DISCIPLINE: beta in [0.2, 2.2] and epsilon in [0.06, 0.30] give a decider-follow probability with mean ~0.70, between-subject SD ~0.09, and support ~[0.55, 0.86] — modestly wider than pi_7, matching the observed tail heterogeneity (Exp 18, real 0.156) and pushing the population conformity discriminant (Exp 19) negative without the extreme dispersion that destabilized earlier attempts. Everything else — one-reason consultation, exact-tie anchoring, A^3-gated stable+momentary heterogeneity, exact 0.5 on full ties, history independence — is retained verbatim from the accepted base."
