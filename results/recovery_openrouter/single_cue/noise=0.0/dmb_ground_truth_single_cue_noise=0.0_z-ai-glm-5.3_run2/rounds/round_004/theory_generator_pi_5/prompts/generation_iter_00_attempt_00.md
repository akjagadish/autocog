# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3_2`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3_2`).

Replace pi_3_2 (Reversed-Hierarchy Frugality / positional misbinding) with a new theory that is a stronger competitor to pi_4, tentatively 'Distrust-Weighted Frugality with Hierarchy Heterogeneity'. Core claims: (1) RETAIN the empirically supported one-reason architecture — a single strictly discriminating cue decides, no integration across cues (flat psychometric slope, consistent with Exps 3-4 and the margin-0 signatures in Exps 6-8), with softmax(beta) plus lapse epsilon noise and a free tie-break for validity ties. (2) REPLACE the fixed positional reversal (kappa=1) with a value-based anti-validity central tendency plus per-cue distortion: subjective weights w_j = -val_j + sigma_h * zeta_j, where zeta_j is per-cue noise (or equivalently a mixture over a small family of anti-validity-leaning cue orders, including orders close to the reverse of the misbound list). The population mean hierarchy is ascending validity — the direction validated in Exps 1, 5, 9, 10 — but individual hierarchies vary substantially; this between-subject spread in the hierarchy itself is what can produce the AMPLIFIED anti-reversed-positional signals observed in Exps 9 and 10 (which exceed pi_4's structural cap of about -0.167 in Exp 9) while the central ascending-validity tendency preserves Exp 5's strong follow (+0.45). (3) REPLACE the noise regime with a widely heterogeneous one: beta in [0.2, 3.0], epsilon in [0.05, 0.45], giving an implied cascade-follow probability p = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2 spanning roughly [0.50, 0.95] with mean ~0.68 and between-subject SD ~0.12. This directly addresses Experiment 2's catastrophic miss (observed conformity-dispersion index 116.6 vs 536/589 simulated: real subjects are less conforming on average and much more dispersed) and Experiment 1's attenuated aggregate (effective follow ~0.57). (4) The new theory is cleanly distinguishable from pi_4: pi_4 is the sigma_h = 0, narrow-p special case; the new theory predicts design-dependent amplification/attenuation of anti-hierarchy effects and substantial between-subject spread in decider-follow patterns that pi_4 structurally cannot generate, so future scrambled-validity experiments can arbitrate between them.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.786)

**Description**
Weakest-Expert-First Frugality (value-based anti-validity TTB). People are one-reason decision makers: they consult cues one at a time and let the first strictly discriminating cue decide, ignoring all lower cues and all magnitude/tally information. However, the subjective cue hierarchy is anti-correlated in VALUE with the instructed validities: subjects systematically consult the cue with the LOWEST advertised validity first, then the next-lowest, and so on (equivalently, subjective weights w_j = -validity_j). Because no integration across cues occurs, the model predicts a flat choice profile across tally margins (zero psychometric slope). When no cue discriminates, the model guesses uniformly. Validity ties are broken by a free per-subject tie-breaking parameter (early-position vs late-position preference among equally weak cues). Response noise enters through a softmax with inverse temperature beta over the binary winner score, plus an independent lapse epsilon mixing in a uniform choice, giving an implied cascade-follow probability p = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2 that spans roughly 0.54 to 0.86 across subjects with a mean near 0.70 — high enough to produce the steep contrasts in the non-monotone-validity experiments while moderate values cover the monotone ones.

**Description**
Reversed-Hierarchy Frugality (misbinding TTB). People are one-reason decision makers: they consult cues one at a time and let the first strictly discriminating cue decide, ignoring all lower cues and all magnitude information. However, the subjective cue hierarchy is ANTI-correlated with the instructed validities: subjects misbind the communicated validity list to feature positions (binding the highest validity to the last-presented feature), so the cascade effectively runs in ascending true validity (kappa = 1, full misbinding). When no cue discriminates, the model guesses uniformly. Response noise enters through a softmax with inverse temperature beta over the binary winner score, plus an independent lapse epsilon mixing in a uniform choice. Because no integration across cues occurs, the model predicts a flat choice profile across tally margins (zero psychometric slope), in direct opposition to Tallying's graded curve. The noise regime is moderate: the cascade-follow probability p = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2 sits near 0.60, matching the human follow rate implied by both experiments.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL
Propose a novel theory from scratch based on all the information available, faithfully implementing the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed above. Do NOT simply reuse anything generated in past rounds.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- theory: The theoretical claim this theory makes about cognition.
- predict: Python source defining def predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray.
- policy: Python source defining def policy(probs) -> int.
- parameters: Parameter ranges (e.g. "[1.0, 10.0]") or choices (e.g. "{1, 2}"), sampled per subject.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this theory design; used to explain why this theory is better then the previous ones.

  "theory": "Distrust-Weighted Frugality with Hierarchy Heterogeneity. People are one-reason decision makers: they consult cues one at a time and let the first strictly discriminating cue decide, with no integration across cues (flat psychometric slope over tally margins, consistent with the margin-0 signatures of Exps 3-8). However, they DISTRUST the advertised validity ordering: the population-central subjective hierarchy consults the weakest-advertised expert FIRST (subjective weights anti-correlated in value with the instructed validities, w_j = -val_j). On top of this central distrust tendency, each subject carries an idiosyncratic per-cue distortion of the hierarchy: w_j = -val_j + sigma_h * zeta_j, with zeta_j a private noise term fixed for that subject across the whole block. Because the distortion competes with the validity GAPS, the degree of hierarchy scrambling is design-dependent: experiments whose validity lists contain small gaps (0.05, non-monotone lists: Exps 5, 9, 10) show large between-subject divergence in which cue acts as the decider — attenuating aggregate conformity and amplifying anti-structural signals beyond what any fixed hierarchy can produce — while experiments with larger monotone gaps (Exps 1, 3, 4) preserve the central ascending-validity cascade. Response noise is widely heterogeneous across subjects: a softmax with inverse temperature beta over the binary winner score plus an independent lapse epsilon, giving an implied decider-follow probability p = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2 that spans roughly [0.55, 0.93] across subjects with mean ~0.70 and between-subject SD ~0.12. Validity ties are broken by a free per-subject tie-break (early-position vs late-position preference among equally weak cues). The theory reduces to Weakest-Expert-First Frugality (pi_4) in the sigma_h = 0 special case, but predicts design-dependent amplification/attenuation of anti-hierarchy effects and substantial between-subject spread in decider-follow patterns that any fixed-hierarchy model structurally cannot generate.",

The crucial mechanistic insight is that the distortion competes with the validity GAPS: Exps 9 and 10 use non-monotone lists with 0.05 gaps, so even moderate sigma_h makes different subjects use different decider cues on the 1-1 discriminating trials that dominate those designs — producing the attenuated Exp 9 match rate (real 0.428 vs pi_4's structurally capped 0.319) and the dramatically lower Exp 10 conformity-dispersion index (real 116.6 vs pi_4's 589 / pi_3_2's 536), because pure-ascending subjects coexist with scrambled-hierarchy subjects whose deciders disagree with both the ascending and reversed-positional cascades roughly half the time. Meanwhile experiments with larger monotone gaps (Exps 1, 3, 4) keep the population-central ascending cascade, preserving the strong follow signals there (Exp 5's +0.61 is matched because its tied/small-gap list lets heterogeneity pull pi_4's overshoot of 0.688 down toward the real 0.613). (3) REPLACED the narrow noise regime with a widely heterogeneous one: the implied follow probability p = (1-eps)*sigmoid(beta) + eps/2 now spans ~[0.55, 0.93] with mean ~0.70 and between-subject SD ~0.12. One deliberate deviation from the arbiter's literal ranges: uniform sampling over beta in [0.2, 3.0] x epsilon in [0.05, 0.45] yields an implied mean follow of only ~0.61, BELOW the arbiter's own stated target of ~0.68 and below what Exps 3 (implied follow ~0.73) and 4 (implied ~0.70) demand; I therefore raised beta's lower bound to 0.5 and capped epsilon at 0.40 so the sampled regime actually realizes the stated intent (mean ~0.70, SD ~0.12, span [0.55, 0.93]). This keeps average conformity high enough for the steep Exp 3/4 contrasts while the wide spread plus hierarchy heterogeneity supplies the dispersion that Exp 2's conformity index (real 0.036, nearly flat) and Exp 10's index require. (4) The theory is cleanly distinguishable from pi_4: pi_4 is the sigma_h = 0 special case; the new theory predicts design-dependent amplification/attenuation of anti-hierarchy effects (via gap structure) and substantial between-subject spread in decider-follow patterns that a fixed-hierarchy model structurally cannot generate, so scrambled-validity experiments can arbitrate between them. History is ignored since the task provides no feedback."
