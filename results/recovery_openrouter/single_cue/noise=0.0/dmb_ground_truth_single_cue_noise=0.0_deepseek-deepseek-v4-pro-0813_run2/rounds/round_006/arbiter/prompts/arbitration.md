# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_6" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_6
People choose between two products through a stable, subject-level mixture of three routes: a weak forward lexicographic scan, a moderate backward/recency lexicographic scan, and feature-win tallying. Choice is modulated by a context-sensitive amplification of a higher-precision backward lexicographic route. The decision maker monitors the trailing 24-trial frequency of fully diagnostic, near-tied-tally comparisons, ignores isolated occurrences via a minimum qualifying count, and maps the qualifying fraction through a band-limited trapezoidal sensitivity curve. Moderate densities of such trials produce the strongest backward amplification, which generates the strong negative top-cue effects seen in dense complementary designs; very high densities attenuate to a lower floor, protecting all-complementary blocks from over-reversal. Sparse designs that never contain fully diagnostic near-tied trials keep the trigger at exactly zero, so their behavior stays governed by the pi_4-like baseline mixture, preserving the near-zero active-inactive contrasts in those experiments.

## THEORY 2 — pi_4
People choose between two options through a stable, subject-level mixture of three comparison routes: (1) forward lexicographic scanning, inspecting cues in descending validity order and stopping at the first discriminating cue; (2) backward lexicographic scanning, inspecting cues in ascending validity order and stopping at the first discriminating cue in that reversed order; and (3) feature-win tallying, where each option receives one point per feature on which it strictly beats the other and ties contribute nothing. The forward and backward lexicographic weights jointly act as a subject-level polarity parameter for first-validity-cue effects: forward weight supports a positive first-discriminator effect, while backward weight supports a negative one. Each route's preferred option is passed through its own softmax choice rule, so responding is noisy but not controlled by a uniform lapse.

**Rationale:** This design drives the advocated model's context-sensitive backward amplification to its peak while critical stimuli stay outside the trigger set, creating a quantitative dissociation from the stable-mixture model. Six experts have validities [0.90, 0.80, 0.72, 0.62, 0.55, 0.50]; feature 5 is the unique lowest-validity cue and is therefore the first cue in every backward/ascending scan. Eight of the 32 unique pairs are inducers: fully diagnostic complementary pairs with tally difference -2, 0, or +2. These satisfy the advocated model's trigger condition (all n features discriminate and abs(tally) <= 2). Because 8 of 32 unique pairs are inducers and each pair is repeated K = 3 times, about 25% of trials qualify, so the trailing 24-trial qualifying fraction sits inside the peak band of the trapezoid and the backward amplification s is near 0.84-0.92 for most of the experiment. The 24 critical pairs are deliberately non-qualifying because at least one feature is tied; they therefore do not change their own trigger status. Every critical pair has the lowest-validity cue discriminating in one direction while m = 1, 2, 3, or 4 other non-tied features discriminate in the opposite direction. With representative base parameters (w_forward = 0.25, w_backward = 0.48, w_tally = 0.27, beta_forward = 0.14, beta_backward = 1.5, beta_tally = 2.2), the stable competing model gives P(A) around 0.51-0.64 for low-cue-A conflicts (graded across m), while the advocated model shifts to about 0.91-0.92 and flattens the m-response curve. The low-cue-B mirror gives competing P(A) around 0.36-0.49, while the advocated model gives about 0.08-0.09. The critical quantitative prediction is therefore a near-flat, low-cue-dominant m-response profile under a qualifying-context background, which a stable mixture cannot produce because its backward weight and beta are capped.

**Computed schedule:** 32 unique pairs × 3 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The design makes the least-valid feature discriminate on every trial while one to four higher-validity features discriminate against it. In the stable mixture, the backward lexicographic route is only one moderate-weight component, so the forward and tally routes pull choice probability away from the least-valid cue and leave congruence around 0.51-0.64. In the advocated model, context-triggered amplification engages a high-precision backward route that starts at the least-valid feature, so choice congruence with that cue rises to roughly 0.85-0.95 and the m-response curve flattens. Averaging a binary congruence indicator over all 96 trials yields a large mean separation while keeping per-subject variance small.

**Rationale:** Six experts with validities [0.90, 0.80, 0.72, 0.61, 0.55, 0.50]. Feature 0 is the unique highest validity and feature 5 is the unique lowest, so forward lexicographic scans stop at feature 0 and backward scans stop at feature 5 whenever both discriminate. Every pair is fully complementary, and feature 0 and feature 5 always discriminate in opposite directions. The four middle features set the tally difference d = A_wins - B_wins to -4, -2, 0, +2, or +4. The d = -2, 0, +2 pairs satisfy the context model's trigger condition: all six features discriminate and |d| <= tie_margin. The d = -4 and d = +4 pairs do not qualify themselves because |d| is too large. There are 28 qualifying unique pairs and 4 nonqualifying unique pairs; each unique pair is repeated K = 3, so 84 of 96 trials qualify and only 12 nonqualifying trials exist in the whole session. Therefore any trailing 24-trial window contains at least 12 qualifying trials, so the qualifying fraction can never fall below 0.50, above the fall_end_frac upper bound of 0.48. After the first few qualifying trials the competing context model is locked at its lower amplification floor s_floor around 0.40-0.50, rather than at zero or at the peak. The advocated stable-mixture model has no context term and uses the same fixed forward, backward, and tally mixture throughout. Using representative mid-range values (w_forward = 0.25, w_backward = 0.48, w_tally = 0.27, beta_forward = 0.14, beta_backward = 1.5, beta_tally = 2.2, s_floor = 0.45, beta_backward_strong = 3.25), the critical low-A d = -4 cell, where feature 5 favors A but the other five features favor B, gives advocated P(A) about 0.51, while the competing model predicts P(A) about 0.71. The full parameter-range gap is roughly 0.43-0.61 for the advocated model versus 0.63-0.80 for the competing model. The mirrored low-B d = +4 cell gives advocated P(A) about 0.49 versus competing about 0.29. The d-response slope is also flatter under the context model, producing a quantitative dissociation rather than a main effect. The 32 unique pairs are balanced over low-cue direction and tally difference.

**Computed schedule:** 32 unique pairs × 3 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Feature 5 is the unique lowest-validity expert, so backward/recency lexicographic scanning stops on it in every trial. The competing context model greatly amplifies a high-precision backward route once the dense all-complementary schedule saturates its context trigger to the floor; that makes feature-5-consistent choices much more frequent than under the advocated stable mixture, whose backward component is only moderate. Averaging this binary match across all 96 within-subject trials yields a low-variance scalar and a large expected between-theory gap.

    resp = data['response'].to_numpy(dtype=float)

    # A choice is feature-5-consistent if it picks the option whose feature 5 equals 1.
    match = np.where(a5 == 1, 1.0 - resp, resp)

**Observed (real) value:** -0.0178 (var=0.0089)
**Predicted under pi_6:** -0.0206 (var=0.0128)
**Predicted under pi_4:** -0.0067 (var=0.0117)

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "pi_6 is the clear winner across the full set of experiments. Pooling absolute deviations from the observed values, pi_6 accumulates roughly 0.30 total error while pi_4 accumulates roughly 1.85. The decisive results are the dense complementary designs: Exp1 and Exp2 show low-cue congruence near 0.84, where pi_6 predicts 0.80 and 0.79 but pi_4 predicts only 0.58 and 0.64. Likewise Exp7, Exp8, and Exp9 show large top-cue reversals or anti-top-cue effects: observed -0.658, -0.671, and 0.155 versus pi_6 predictions -0.672, -0.641, and 0.145, while pi_4 predicts -0.283, -0.072, and 0.416. pi_4 is not merely noisy on these effects; its static mixture structurally lacks the context-sensitive reweighting needed to produce strong backward or recency-driven reversal in dense complementary blocks while also producing near-zero active-inactive contrasts in sparse designs such as Exp11 through Exp14. pi_6 has the correct qualitative mechanism and remains close on the sparse designs as well. Its residual misfits, such as Exp4 (0.456 predicted versus 0.420 observed), Exp8 (0.641 versus 0.671), and Exp13 (0.037 versus -0.005), are modest and parameter-level rather than structural. Therefore pi_6 should be retained, and pi_4 should be replaced rather than merely retuned.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_4 with a new adaptive cue-reliability theory. The new theory should keep a baseline forward-lexicographic, backward-lexicographic, and tally route, but instead of using fixed mixture weights it should continuously update subjective cue weights from local trial statistics. The key state variables should be the density of recent discriminating cues, the signed tally margin, and whether high-validity and low-validity cues disagree. When many recent trials are fully discriminating and near-tied, the agent should infer that the nominal validity ordering is locally uninformative and temporarily shift weight toward the lowest-validity or most recently discriminating cue, producing the strong negative top-cue effects seen in Exp7, Exp8, and Exp9. When such conflict is sparse or absent, the weights should decay back to the default mixture, preserving the near-zero active-inactive contrasts in Exp11 through Exp14. Unlike pi_6's fixed 24-trial trapezoidal trigger, this theory should use a smooth accumulation and decay process, possibly with an asymmetric learning rate and hysteresis, so that it can better capture gradual density effects and the remaining small mismatches. The parameter ranges should include baseline route weights, baseline softmax precisions, the maximum reversed cue weight, a conflict accumulation rate, a decay rate, a conflict threshold, and a response noise term."
