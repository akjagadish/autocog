# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace pi_4 with a new adaptive cue-reliability theory. The new theory should keep a baseline forward-lexicographic, backward-lexicographic, and tally route, but instead of using fixed mixture weights it should continuously update subjective cue weights from local trial statistics. The key state variables should be the density of recent discriminating cues, the signed tally margin, and whether high-validity and low-validity cues disagree. When many recent trials are fully discriminating and near-tied, the agent should infer that the nominal validity ordering is locally uninformative and temporarily shift weight toward the lowest-validity or most recently discriminating cue, producing the strong negative top-cue effects seen in Exp7, Exp8, and Exp9. When such conflict is sparse or absent, the weights should decay back to the default mixture, preserving the near-zero active-inactive contrasts in Exp11 through Exp14. Unlike pi_6's fixed 24-trial trapezoidal trigger, this theory should use a smooth accumulation and decay process, possibly with an asymmetric learning rate and hysteresis, so that it can better capture gradual density effects and the remaining small mismatches. The parameter ranges should include baseline route weights, baseline softmax precisions, the maximum reversed cue weight, a conflict accumulation rate, a decay rate, a conflict threshold, and a response noise term.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People choose between two products through a baseline mixture of a weak forward lexicographic scan, a moderate lowest-validity-first lexicographic scan, and feature-win tallying. On top of that baseline, decision makers continuously accumulate local evidence about cue reliability. The key evidence is near-tied trials with high discrimination density: a graded density term replaces the old all-features-discriminate gate, so five-of-six discriminating trials contribute while sparse three- or four-of-six trials do not. Near-tied trials where the highest-validity cue is tied or absent provide smaller base evidence, while true opposite-direction disagreement between the highest- and lowest-validity cues adds a bonus. This evidence enters a leaky accumulator with asymmetric rise and decay, a minimum qualifying count, and hysteresis. When it passes a lowered threshold, weight smoothly and persistently shifts toward the lowest-validity-first route, which deepens reversal in dense partially-discriminating blocks and increases low-cue consistency in top-cue-tied blocks, while sparse designs decay back to the baseline mixture.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal in-family repair of the accumulator-mixture model. The old hard gate required all features to discriminate, which blocked Exp6/Exp7 and Exp13 from reaching the reversed regime. The new trial_evidence replaces that binary gate with a graded discrimination-density term: evidence is scaled by n_discrim/n_features and only trials with density above a fixed 0.80 floor contribute. This lets five-of-six discriminating trials in Exp6/Exp7 and Exp13 accumulate while keeping the three- or four-of-six sparse trials in Exp11/Exp12 sub-threshold. The disagreement requirement is also weakened: near-tied trials with a tied or absent top cue now receive smaller tied-top base evidence, so Exp13 accumulates despite frequent top-cue ties, while true high-low disagreement retains a bonus. Finally, the reversed route is deepened by raising s_max to [0.75, 0.85] and the evidence threshold is lowered to [0.03, 0.05], closing the Exp6/Exp7/Exp13 under-reversal gaps. The asymmetric rise/decay, hysteresis, minimum qualifying count, and response-noise machinery are kept unchanged, so sparse designs still decay back to the baseline mixture and Exp5 remains strongly reversed.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0583 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0407 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0407.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the arbiter's adaptive cue-reliability family: a leaky evidence accumulator with asymmetric rise/decay, hysteresis, a qualifying threshold, and a smooth mixture between baseline forward/backward/tally routes and a strengthened lowest-validity-first route. Fit is excellent on many experiments: Exp1 0.232 vs real 0.249, Exp2 0.425 vs 0.420, Exp4 -0.270 vs -0.274, Exp5 exactly -0.658 vs -0.658, Exp8 0.013 vs 0.015, Exp14 0.827 vs 0.841; the sparse active-inactive contrasts stay near zero (Exps 9-12 within ~0.04 of real). However, there is a consistent under-reversal in the partially-discriminating dense blocks: Exp6 -0.443 vs -0.671 (candidate +0.23 too weak), Exp7 0.228 vs 0.155 (+0.07 too weak, i.e., not reversed enough), Exp13 0.741 vs 0.843 (-0.10 too weak). The common cause is the evidence gate: it requires ALL features to discriminate (full = n_discrim >= n_features) and hi-lo disagreement. Exp5 and Exp14 are fully complementary, so the gate passes and the fit is near perfect; Exp6 and Exp7 contain mostly partially-tied trials, so almost no evidence accumulates and the model never reaches the deepened reversal; Exp13 has many top-cue ties so the disagreement clause also blocks evidence, yet humans show the strongest low-cue consistency there. Notably, pi_6's values on those same metrics (-0.641, 0.145, 0.805) demonstrate that this family can reach the real values; the candidate's smooth accumulator just needs recalibration, not replacement. The spoils in sparse designs (Exp11/12 near zero) exist precisely because those designs also lack fully discriminating trials, so any fix must be graded rather than binary to avoid firing evidence in Exps 11/12.
Rationale: Keep the adaptive cue-reliability family and the baseline mixture, but recalibrate the evidence gating and activation depth. (1) Replace the hard 'all features discriminate' gate with a graded discrimination-density term (e.g., scale evidence by n_discrim/n_features, with a floor such that Exp11/12's 3-4-of-6 trials stay sub-threshold while Exp6/7's 5-of-6 trials contribute). (2) Weaken the disagreement requirement: give a smaller base evidence on near-tied trials where the top cue is tied or absent, keeping only a bonus for true hi-lo disagreement, so Exp13 accumulates despite frequent hi ties. (3) Slightly deepen saturation (raise s_max toward ~0.85 and/or lower the conflict threshold) to close the remaining Exp6/7/13 gaps, while verifying Exp5 retains its exact -0.658 and Exps 8-12 remain within noise of zero. Keep asymmetric rise/decay, hysteresis, min qualifying count, and epsilon noise as-is; do not switch mechanism families, since the accumulator + mixture loop already captures the sparse-to-dense continuum and only the gating and ceiling need this minor in-family repair.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0583 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0407 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is a faithful in-family adaptive cue-reliability implementation and aggregate loss improved from 0.0583 to 0.0407. It is now very close on several experiments: Exp2 0.437 vs 0.420, Exp3 -0.124 vs -0.130, Exp7 0.157 vs 0.155, Exp8 0.025 vs 0.015, Exp10 0.004 vs -0.001. The graded density gate also fixed much of the previous under-reversal in Exp6 (-0.443 to -0.557 vs real -0.671) and Exp13 (0.741 to 0.792 vs real 0.843). However, four residual failures remain. Exp5 regressed from an exact -0.658 to -0.718, i.e., the reversal route now saturates too strongly in fully discriminating designs. Exp6 is still under-reversed by +0.114 and Exp13 remains -0.050 below the real low-cue consistency. Critically, Exp11 is +0.057 while the real active-inactive contrast is near zero, and it moved from +0.009 in iter 1 to +0.057 now. This indicates the relaxed graded evidence gate is firing on the occasional dense 5-of-6 trials embedded in an otherwise sparse design, violating the arbiter's requirement that sparse designs decay back to the baseline mixture.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the same adaptive cue-reliability accumulator-mixture family, but recalibrate the evidence gating in-family. The previous graded density repair was accepted and should be retained, but it needs a temporal-density constraint: make activation depend on a recent run of evidence trials (e.g., at least k of the last m trials produce nonzero trial_evidence), rather than a slow all-history leaky count. This should preserve the near-zero Exp11/Exp12 contrasts while still firing in the sustained dense blocks of Exp6/Exp7. Second, lower s_max from [0.75, 0.85] to roughly [0.65, 0.75] because the reversed route is now too deep in fully discriminating designs: Exp5 should move back from -0.718 toward -0.658, and Exp14 from 0.870 toward 0.841; this also reduces the modest over-reversal in Exp1 and Exp4. Third, compensate for the lower ceiling on under-reversed Exp6 by increasing evidence_rise and possibly hi_lo_bonus/base_evidence, so partially discriminating dense blocks reach that lower ceiling sooner while fully discriminating Exp5 simply stays capped. Fourth, raise tied_top_evidence modestly to close Exp13's remaining -0.050 gap without changing the sparse designs. Keep the baseline forward/backward/tally routes, asymmetric rise/decay, hysteresis, and response noise as-is. Do not switch mechanism families."
