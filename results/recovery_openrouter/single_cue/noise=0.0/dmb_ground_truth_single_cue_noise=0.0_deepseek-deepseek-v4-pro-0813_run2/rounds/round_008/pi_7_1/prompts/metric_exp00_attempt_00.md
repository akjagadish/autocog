# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** This design isolates the density criterion that separates the advocated accumulator theory from the competing fully-diagnostic frequency trigger. Six experts have distinct validities [0.90, 0.80, 0.70, 0.60, 0.55, 0.50]; feature 0 is the unique highest-validity cue and feature 5 is the unique lowest-validity cue, so forward lexicographic scans stop at feature 0 and backward scans stop at feature 5 whenever both discriminate. On every trial those two cues discriminate in opposite directions, making the forward and backward routes disagree. Exactly four of the six experts discriminate on every trial; the remaining two middle experts are tied. This makes the discrimination density 4/6 = 0.667, which is above the advocated density floor range of 0.56 to 0.62 but below the competing fully-diagnostic criterion of all six experts discriminating. The tally difference among the four discriminating experts is +2, 0, or -2, all within both models' near-tie margins. Because no trial is fully diagnostic (two experts are always tied), the competing context signal is exactly zero throughout the experiment, so its backward amplification s stays zero and choice remains at the baseline forward/backward/tally mixture. The advocated accumulator, in contrast, treats every one of these dense four-of-six top-low conflict trials as evidence-positive: density exceeds the floor, the highest and lowest cues disagree, and the tally does not oppose the top cue. The evidence values are moderate, roughly 0.35 to 0.50, so after the minimum qualifying count of four evidence-positive trials and saturation of the accumulator, S rises toward s_max near 0.72 to 0.78, with no full-diagnostic penalty because full_frac is zero. As a result, on top-A / low-B trials with tally +2, the competing baseline predicts P(A) around 0.48 whereas the advocated model shifts strongly to the lowest-validity-first route and predicts P(A) around 0.16 to 0.18. On the mirrored top-B / low-A tally -2 trials, the competing baseline predicts P(A) around 0.52 whereas the advocated model predicts P(A) around 0.82 to 0.84. The d = 0 cells produce smaller but same-direction gaps of about 0.22. This produces a large low-cue-direction by tally-sign interaction that cannot be produced by any parameter settings of the competing theory because its trigger never fires for non-fully-diagnostic trials. The 32 unique pairs are balanced over top-cue direction, tally difference, which middle experts discriminate, and tied-expert display values, and are repeated K = 3 for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 32 unique pairs × 3 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People choose between two products through a baseline mixture of a weak forward lexicographic scan, a moderate lowest-validity-first lexicographic scan, and feature-win tallying. Decision makers continuously accumulate local evidence about cue reliability from recent discriminating trials. Evidence is graded by discrimination density: near-tied trials with only a few discriminating features contribute little or nothing, while dense five-of-six or fully discriminating trials drive a leaky accumulator. The accumulator has asymmetric rise and decay, a minimum qualifying count, hysteresis, and smooth activation of a strengthened lowest-validity-first route. When fully discriminating trials dominate the local evidence stream, the reversed route is gently capped below its maximum so strongly complementary designs reverse strongly but not excessively. When dense conflict is sparse, evidence decays back to baseline mixture weights, preserving near-zero active-inactive contrasts in sparse designs.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People choose between two products through a stable, subject-level mixture of three routes: a weak forward lexicographic scan, a moderate backward/recency lexicographic scan, and feature-win tallying. Choice is modulated by a context-sensitive amplification of a higher-precision backward lexicographic route. The decision maker monitors the trailing 24-trial frequency of fully diagnostic, near-tied-tally comparisons, ignores isolated occurrences via a minimum qualifying count, and maps the qualifying fraction through a band-limited trapezoidal sensitivity curve. Moderate densities of such trials produce the strongest backward amplification, which generates the strong negative top-cue effects seen in dense complementary designs; very high densities attenuate to a lower floor, protecting all-complementary blocks from over-reversal. Sparse designs that never contain fully diagnostic near-tied trials keep the trigger at exactly zero, so their behavior stays governed by the pi_4-like baseline mixture, preserving the near-zero active-inactive contrasts in those experiments.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "The metric is the mean proportion of choices that follow the lowest-validity-first lexicographic route. With the fixed validities [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.75, 0.73], the reversed scan order is feature 3, then 2, 5, 4, 1, 0. For each trial I find the first feature in that reversed order that discriminates and score 1 if the subject chose the option it favors. Because no trial in this design is fully diagnostic, the competing context trigger stays exactly zero, so its choices reflect only the baseline mixture, which produces moderate and stable backward-route adherence. The advocated accumulator treats dense top-low conflict trials as evidence, raises its reversed-route weight, and shifts choices toward this lowest-validity-first winner on subsequent trials. Averaging over all 96 trials gives a stable per-subject estimate and should create a large pooled mean gap between the two theories."
