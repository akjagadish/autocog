# generation_iter_05_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5_2`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5_2`).

Propose a new adaptive strategy-selection theory. The baseline should resemble the stable mixture in pi_4, with forward lexicographic scanning, backward lexicographic scanning and feature-win tallying, because that baseline correctly yields near-zero active-inactive contrasts in Experiments 1-2 and moderate effects in Experiments 3-6. On top of that baseline, add a context-sensitive boost of the backward or recency route, with a smooth trigger weight s between 0 and 1, so the choice probability is approximately (1-s)*(w_f*p_forward + w_b*p_backward + w_t*p_tally) + s*p_backward_strong. The crucial design constraint is that the trigger must not be the old condition that a unique highest-validity cue and unique lowest-validity cue discriminate in opposite directions while the tally does not oppose the highest cue, because Experiments 1 and 2 show that condition produces no behavioral change. Instead the trigger should be a diagnosticity or block-level context signal that is absent in the sparse, small tally-difference designs of Experiments 1-2 but present in the dense, often complementary or tally-tied designs of Experiments 7-9. Candidate signals for the next proposal to test are: the density of recent trials in which most or all cues discriminate, the frequency of tied or near-tied feature-win tallies in recent trials, or a configural suffix signal in which a run of low-validity cues jointly opposes the high-validity prefix. The new theory should simultaneously predict near-zero gate effects in Experiments 1-2, strong negative top-cue effects around -0.66 in Experiments 7-8, a low top-consistent choice rate around 0.15 in Experiment 9, and preserve the close fits to Experiments 3-6 and the near-zero effects in Experiments 10-12. Keep subject-level heterogeneity in baseline route weights and in sensitivity to the context signal, but do not rely on a large uniform lapse parameter.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.771)

**Description**
People choose between two options through a stable, subject-level mixture of three comparison routes: (1) forward lexicographic scanning, inspecting cues in descending validity order and stopping at the first discriminating cue; (2) backward lexicographic scanning, inspecting cues in ascending validity order and stopping at the first discriminating cue in that reversed order; and (3) feature-win tallying, where each option receives one point per feature on which it strictly beats the other and ties contribute nothing. The forward and backward lexicographic weights jointly act as a subject-level polarity parameter for first-validity-cue effects: forward weight supports a positive first-discriminator effect, while backward weight supports a negative one. Each route's preferred option is passed through its own softmax choice rule, so responding is noisy but not controlled by a uniform lapse.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.481)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_5_2` (overall score: 0.446)

**Description**
People compare options through a conflict-gated dual-lexicographic/tallying system. A baseline mixture combines a weak forward Take-The-Best route, a moderate backward lexicographic route, and feature-win tallying. When the highest-validity and lowest-validity cues discriminate in opposite directions and the tally does not oppose the highest cue, the decision maker enters a conflict regime: tallying is suspended and the choice is made with high probability by a strong backward lexicographic scan over ascending validities. Subjects differ substantially in how strongly and deterministically they reverse on such conflict trials.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0832 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0495 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0657 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0440 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5: loss=0.0392 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 5 at loss=0.0392 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
People compare two products through a stable, subject-level mixture of three routes: a weak forward lexicographic scan, a moderate backward/recency lexicographic scan, and feature-win tallying. Choice is modulated by a context-sensitive amplification of a higher-precision backward lexicographic route. The decision maker monitors the trailing 24-trial frequency of fully diagnostic, near-tied-tally comparisons ('fully complementary, tally-tied' trials), ignores isolated occurrences via a minimum qualifying count, and maps the qualifying fraction through a band-limited trapezoidal sensitivity curve. Moderate densities of such trials (roughly 0.14-0.34 of the recent window) produce the strongest backward amplification, which generates the strong negative top-cue effects seen in dense complementary designs; very high densities attenuate back to a lower floor, protecting all-complementary blocks from over-reversal. Sparse designs that never contain fully diagnostic near-tied trials keep the trigger at exactly zero, so their behavior stays governed by the pi_4-like baseline mixture, preserving the near-zero active-inactive contrasts in those experiments.

`rationale`: This is a minimal-diff recalibration of the accepted count-gated, band-limited trigger, applying the critic's four points without touching the mechanism or the pi_4-like baseline. (1) s_max is raised from [0.68, 0.76] to [0.76, 0.84] so a fully triggered Experiment 6 block reaches the backward-dominant mixture required for the observed -0.66 rather than stalling near -0.49. (2) peak_start is lowered from [0.12, 0.18] to [0.08, 0.14] so the roughly 0.16-0.25 qualifying fractions in Experiments 6-7 sit unambiguously inside the peak plateau for every parameter draw instead of straddling the rising ramp (the source of the iter-4 Exp 6 miss). (3) context_window is fixed at {24}, which the critic requested to place dense-design fractions comfortably between the lowered peak_start and the existing peak_end of 0.26-0.34, while Experiment 5's high qualifying fraction (12/24 = 0.5) continues to exceed fall_end and therefore maps to s_floor, keeping its -0.66 fit intact. (4) beta_backward_strong stays in [2.50, 4.00] rather than being pushed near-deterministic, avoiding the previously rejected overshoot pattern. Experiments 1-4 and 8-12 contain no all-cues-discriminate near-tied-tally trials, so the trigger remains exactly s = 0 there and the near-zero gate effects and pi_4-level baseline fits are preserved; only Experiments 5, 6, and 7 are affected, in precisely the directions required.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family: a stable pi_4-like three-route baseline plus a smooth, block-level context trigger (s) that amplifies a strong backward/recency route. The trigger is correctly absent wherever no trial has every cue discriminating with a near-tied tally, which is why Experiments 1-4 and 8-12 are preserved almost exactly: Exp 1 (0.2431 vs 0.2487), Exp 2 (0.4435 vs 0.4196), Exp 3 (-0.1617 vs -0.1300), Exp 4 (-0.2683 vs -0.2742), Exp 8 (0.0229 vs 0.0150), Exp 9 (0.0279 vs -0.0283), Exp 10 (-0.0046 vs -0.0008), Exp 11 (-0.0100 vs -0.0050), Exp 12 (0.0389 vs -0.0178). Experiment 5 also fits well (-0.6617 vs -0.6583) because roughly 12 of 32 trials are fully complementary, giving context ≈ 0.375 and s ≈ 0.63.

The failures are Experiments 6 and 7, and they share one cause: the trigger is underpowered where it needs to fire. In Exp 6 only ~6 of 32 trials are fully diagnostic AND tally-tied, and in Exp 7 the same ~19% density applies (and drops to ~6% if the sampled tie_margin is below 2, since several qualifying trials there have |tally| = 2). The logistic mapping with context_anchor 0.08-0.18 and context_gain 7-14 turns context ≈ 0.19 into s ≈ 0.38, so the mixture is only ~38% strong-backward. That yields Exp 6 = -0.2467 (observed -0.6711, a 0.42 miss) and Exp 7 = 0.3250 (observed 0.1553, a 0.17 miss). A back-of-envelope mixture calculation confirms this: 0.62*0.04 + 0.38*(-0.9) ≈ -0.32 for Exp 6, and 0.62*0.416 + 0.38*0.15 ≈ 0.32 for Exp 7 — matching the simulated values almost exactly. The data require s ≈ 0.70-0.75 in both experiments. So the trigger signal is pointed at the right experiments but its sensitivity is miscalibrated, and the candidate's own rationale overstates how strongly it fires in 6-7.
Rationale: Keep the mechanism exactly as prescribed (baseline mixture + smooth context-triggered backward boost) but recalibrate the trigger's sensitivity so that the ~19% signal density in Experiments 6-7 maps to s ≈ 0.70-0.75 instead of ≈ 0.38, while context = 0 still maps to s = 0 exactly (preserving all near-zero experiments). Concretely: (1) lower context_anchor to [0.02, 0.05]; (2) raise context_gain to [14, 20]; (3) raise s_max to [0.75, 0.85]; (4) raise tie_margin to [2.0, 3.0] so the fully diagnostic |tally|=2 trials in Exp 7 count (with margin 1.5 they are excluded and context collapses to ~0.06). With anchor 0.03/gain 15/s_max 0.80, context 0.19 gives s ≈ 0.69 (Exp 6 ≈ -0.62 to -0.66, Exp 7 ≈ 0.13-0.16) and context 0.375 gives s ≈ 0.79 (Exp 5 stays ≈ -0.66). Do NOT relax the 'all cues discriminate' requirement to n-1: several Exp 8 trials have 7 of 8 cues discriminating with |tally|=1, so a relaxed trigger would fire there and jeopardize its required near-zero gate effect. Since zero-signal experiments have no qualifying trials at all, the recalibrated trigger stays exactly at s = 0 there, so Experiments 1-4 and 8-12 remain untouched. This is a minor in-family calibration adjustment, not a family switch.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0832 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0495 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family: it keeps a stable pi_4-like three-route baseline and adds a smooth context-triggered amplification of a strong backward/recency route. The trigger is correctly absent in the sparse designs, which is why the zero-signal block remains intact: Exp4 is exact (-0.2742 vs -0.2742), and Exp8, Exp9, Exp10, Exp11, and Exp12 are all near zero, mostly within 0.02-0.04 of the real values with high subject variance. The main success of the recalibration is Exp7, which moved from 0.3250 to 0.1770 against a real value of 0.1553, and Exp6 improved from -0.2467 to -0.4639. However, two localized failures remain. Exp6 still misses by +0.207 (candidate -0.4639 vs real -0.6711), and Exp5 now overshoots by -0.0996 (candidate -0.7579 vs real -0.6583). The likely reason is that the context-to-s logistic map is too graded: Exp5's high complementarity density pushes s close to its maximum, producing too much backward amplification there, while Exp6's lower density does not push s high enough to generate the required strong negative top-cue effect. The mismatch between Exp5 and Exp6 is therefore a calibration problem in the trigger's gain curve, not evidence against the adaptive strategy itself.
Rationale: Keep the same three-route mixture plus context-triggered backward amplification, but recalibrate the s mapping one more time. The useful behavior is a saturating trigger: zero context must still give s exactly 0, but once context exceeds roughly 0.15 the trigger should rise quickly to a plateau around 0.72-0.75 and then stay approximately flat, rather than continuing to increase from 0.19 to 0.375. Concretely, narrow s_max to about 0.72-0.75 and make the mapping steep enough that both the roughly 0.19 density in Exp6-7 and the roughly 0.375 density in Exp5 land on that same plateau. This should simultaneously pull Exp6 down toward -0.66 and pull Exp5 back from -0.76 toward -0.66 without harming Exp7. If a plateau alone still leaves Exp6 too weak, strengthen the amplified route itself by raising beta_backward_strong toward its high end or making the strong backward route near-deterministic once selected, because the route alone needs to produce a very strong negative effect under a 0.72-0.75 mixture. Keep the trigger condition exactly as it is, keep context 0 mapping exactly to s 0, and do not relax the all-cues-discriminate requirement, since that would risk firing in Exp8-12.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0495 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0657 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family: a stable pi_4-like three-route baseline plus a smooth context-triggered amplification of a stronger backward route. It has real strengths: Experiment 3 is essentially exact (-0.1329 vs -0.1300), Experiment 7 is excellent (0.1460 vs 0.1553), Experiment 1 is close (0.2356 vs 0.2487), and Experiment 6 improved from the accepted base (-0.5733 vs -0.6711) though it still falls short. However, the candidate is rejected by the aggregate gate, and the reason is visible. The high-gain normalized trigger plus the near-deterministic strong backward route now overshoots Experiment 5 badly (-0.7967 vs -0.6583), while the intended plateau does not equalize Experiment 5 and Experiment 6 because their metrics have different baseline and strong-route compositions. At the same time several near-zero experiments deteriorated: Experiment 4 moved from the accepted base's exact -0.2742 to -0.3138, Experiment 9 from -0.0042 to 0.0129, Experiment 10 from 0.0029 to -0.0404, Experiment 11 from 0.0367 to -0.0458, and Experiment 12 from 0.0022 to 0.0139. The most likely mechanism is that the logistic context signal is normalized between its value at context 0 and context 1, so even one qualifying trial in the recent window can produce a substantial nonzero s. With the sharpened beta_backward_strong of 4.0-7.0, that leakage is enough to distort otherwise zero-signal designs.
Rationale: My previous push toward a saturating high-gain plateau and beta_backward_strong 4.0-7.0 did move Experiment 6 and Experiment 7 in the right direction, but the gate rejected that candidate because it overshot Experiment 5 and disturbed the near-zero experiments. I will not repeat that exact adjustment. Instead, from the accepted iter-2 base, keep the same three-route mixture and context-triggered backward amplification, but change the context response in two ways. First, replace the normalized logistic over mean density with a count-gated trigger: count the number of qualifying all-cues-discriminate and near-tied-tally trials in the trailing window, set s exactly to 0 below a minimum qualifying count such as 2 or 3, and only then allow s to rise. This removes the leakage where one qualifying trial can create s around 0.4-0.55. Second, make the density response band-limited rather than a monotonic plateau: peak the trigger at moderate qualifying counts, approximately 5-8 trials in a 20-24 trial window, and attenuate it at high density. This is what the data require, because Experiment 5 has roughly twice the dense complementarity frequency of Experiment 6 and Experiment 7 yet should not receive a stronger backward boost; a moderate-density band would keep the boost strong in Experiments 6-7 while pulling Experiment 5 back from -0.80 toward -0.66. In addition, moderate the amplified route itself, for example beta_backward_strong around 2.5-4.0 and s_max around 0.60-0.70, so the strong route is not near-deterministic. Keep the all-cues-discriminate and near-tied-tally condition intact and do not relax it, because that condition is what protects Experiments 8-12. This is still the prescribed adaptive strategy-selection mechanism; it only recalibrates how the context count maps onto the backward-route boost.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0657 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0440 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family: a stable pi_4-like three-route baseline (weak forward lexicographic, moderate backward lexicographic, feature-win tally) plus a smooth, count-gated context trigger that amplifies a stronger backward route. It is the best aggregate proposal in this loop so far (loss 0.0440) and, importantly, it fixed the previous Experiment 5 overshoot exactly (-0.6613 vs -0.6583) while keeping the near-zero experiments essentially intact: Exp 8 0.0121 vs 0.0150, Exp 9 0.0004 vs -0.0283 (both effectively zero given the metric variance), Exp 10 0.0133 vs -0.0008, Exp 12 0.0022 vs -0.0178. Experiments 3 and 4 are within 0.01 of the real values, and Experiments 1 and 2 carry only the small baseline-level residuals that pi_4 already had. The single significant failure is Experiment 6: -0.4933 vs -0.6711, a miss of +0.178 on the other arbiter-named -0.66 target. Experiment 7 is also modestly high (0.1913 vs 0.1553, +0.036). The likely cause is calibration, not mechanism: Experiment 6 has only about 6 qualifying trials out of 32 (fraction roughly 0.19 with a 32-trial window, about 0.25 with a 24-trial window), which sits at the very edge of the peak plateau (peak_start 0.12-0.18), so some parameter draws land in the rising ramp instead of at s_max; and s_max 0.68-0.76 is itself slightly too weak for the backward-dominant mixture the Exp 6 metric requires. By contrast, Experiment 5 is protected by the band-limited design because its near-unity qualifying fraction maps to s_floor, which is exactly why Exp 5 is on target and why raising only the plateau height should leave it untouched.
Rationale: Keep the accepted count-gated, band-limited mechanism exactly intact and make a targeted in-family recalibration. (1) Raise s_max to [0.76, 0.84] so a fully triggered Exp 6 block approaches the backward-dominant mixture needed for -0.66, while keeping s_floor near [0.48, 0.58] so Experiment 5's high qualifying fraction continues to map to the low floor and stays at its exact -0.66 fit. (2) Lower peak_start to [0.08, 0.14] so the Exp 6/7 qualifying fraction of roughly 0.19-0.25 lies unambiguously inside the peak plateau for all parameter draws instead of straddling the rising edge. (3) Prefer context_window 24 for the dense designs, which raises Exp 6's qualifying fraction to about 0.25 and places it safely between the lowered peak_start and the existing peak_end 0.26-0.34. (4) Do NOT push beta_backward_strong upward toward near-deterministic values; my earlier iteration-2-style push to a near-deterministic strong route plus monotonic plateau was rejected by the gate for overshooting Experiment 5, so keep beta_backward_strong in 2.5-4.0. The same increase in plateau height should also pull Experiment 7 slightly downward from 0.1913 toward the observed 0.1553. Experiments 1-4 and 8-12 contain no all-cues-discriminate near-tied trials, so their near-zero and close fits remain untouched as long as the trigger condition itself is not relaxed — keep requiring all cues to discriminate with |tally| <= tie_margin. This is a minor sensitivity adjustment within the prescribed adaptive strategy-selection family, not a mechanism switch.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0440 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.0392 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 5 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed adaptive strategy-selection family and is the best aggregate proposal so far (loss 0.0392). The trigger is correctly silent in the sparse designs: Exp8 -0.0196 vs 0.0150, Exp9 -0.0008 vs -0.0283, Exp10 0.0108 vs -0.0008, Exp11 -0.0175 vs -0.0050, and Exp12 -0.0111 vs -0.0178 are all effectively zero. Exp3 is nearly exact (-0.1363 vs -0.1300), Exp4 is close (-0.2600 vs -0.2742), and Exp7 is almost exact (0.1613 vs 0.1553). The remaining substantive failure is the pair of -0.66 target experiments, and it is a mirror-image calibration problem: Exp6 is too weak (-0.5683 vs -0.6711, delta +0.1028) while Exp5 is too strong (-0.7042 vs -0.6583, delta -0.0458). This suggests the plateau height for moderate density is slightly too low and the high-density floor is slightly too high. The current rationale assumed Exp5 would stay fixed because it maps to s_floor, but Exp5 moved from -0.6613 to -0.7042 across the iteration, so the floor term itself needs downward recalibration. The small residual in Exp8 is inherited baseline-level noise and is not a trigger firing error.
Rationale: Keep the accepted count-gated, band-limited trigger exactly intact, including the all-cues-discriminate and near-tied-tally gate and the minimum qualifying count of 2-3. Do not relax the gate or lower the minimum count, because the sparse zero-effect experiments depend on it. Do not push beta_backward_strong toward near-deterministic values; the earlier near-deterministic push was rejected. Instead make another small in-family calibration: raise s_max from [0.76, 0.84] to about [0.84, 0.92] so the moderate-density Exp6 block gets closer to the backward-dominant mixture required for -0.66, and lower s_floor from [0.50, 0.62] to about [0.40, 0.50] so Exp5's high qualifying fraction produces a weaker backward boost. Keep context_window 24 and peak_start [0.08, 0.14] so Exp6 and Exp7 remain on the plateau rather than the rising ramp. The expected result is Exp6 moving from -0.57 toward -0.65 to -0.67, Exp5 moving back from -0.70 toward -0.66, and Exp7 remaining around 0.14-0.16; if Exp7 drops too far below 0.14, use the lower half of the s_max interval. This extends the accepted iter-4 direction rather than switching mechanisms.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.0392 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "People choose between two products through a stable, subject-level mixture of three routes: a weak forward lexicographic scan, a moderate backward/recency lexicographic scan, and feature-win tallying. Choice is modulated by a context-sensitive amplification of a higher-precision backward lexicographic route. The decision maker monitors the trailing 24-trial frequency of fully diagnostic, near-tied-tally comparisons, ignores isolated occurrences via a minimum qualifying count, and maps the qualifying fraction through a band-limited trapezoidal sensitivity curve. Moderate densities of such trials produce the strongest backward amplification, which generates the strong negative top-cue effects seen in dense complementary designs; very high densities attenuate to a lower floor, protecting all-complementary blocks from over-reversal. Sparse designs that never contain fully diagnostic near-tied trials keep the trigger at exactly zero, so their behavior stays governed by the pi_4-like baseline mixture, preserving the near-zero active-inactive contrasts in those experiments.",
