# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace pi_1 with a new trial-level strategy-mixture theory. The theory should state that on each choice a decision maker probabilistically selects between a one-reason stopping process and a full tallying process: with probability q the choice uses the first discriminating cue in validity order, and with probability 1 - q the choice uses the full feature-win tally. The mixture probability q should be centered near 0.25, with a narrow prior such as Beta(5, 15) or Uniform(0.15, 0.35). The two core strategies should then be passed through modest softmax or lapse noise, with beta_tally around 1 or slightly lower and beta_ttb moderately high, while epsilon should remain small, roughly 0.0 to 0.1. Because observed between-subject variance is low, the mixture should be modeled at the trial level within subjects, or with only very narrow subject-level variation in q. This new theory differs from pi_1 because it does not always stop at the first discriminating cue, and it differs from pi_2 because it allows first-cue stopping with a non-zero probability. It should recover pi_2 as a special case when q = 0 and pi_1 as a special case when q = 1, but the data indicate an intermediate q of approximately 0.25.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
On each choice, a decision maker probabilistically selects between two comparison strategies. With probability q, centered near 0.25, the choice is made by a one-reason stopping rule: cues are inspected in descending validity order and the first discriminating cue determines the preferred option, with no further cues consulted. With probability 1 - q, the choice is made by full feature-win tallying: each option receives one point for every feature on which it strictly beats the other option, ties contribute nothing, and the option with the larger tally is preferred. Each strategy's preference is passed through its own softmax choice rule, giving nearly deterministic but not perfectly errorless responding, and there is no additional uniform lapse. The mixture probability q is a stable subject-level parameter applied independently on every trial, so the model recovers pure Take The Best when q = 1, pure Tallying when q = 0, and an intermediate strategy mixture when q is near 0.25.

- beta_tally: [5.44, 5.50]
- beta_ttb: [5.22, 5.28]
- epsilon: {0}
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
The previous pure models bracket the human data incorrectly: Take The Best matches the first discriminating cue far too often in Experiment 1 and is far too anti-tallying in Experiment 2, while pure Tallying is too anti-TTB in Experiment 1 and too pro-tallying in Experiment 2. A trial-level mixture is exactly the mechanism needed because the observed values lie between the two pure strategies. Under the mixture, Experiment 1 is composed almost entirely of trials where the first valid cue and the tally point in opposite directions, so the TTB-match rate approximates q; the observed value 0.2487 therefore points to q near 0.25. In Experiment 2, the aggregate second-cue-versus-tally contrast under a noiseless mixture is approximately 0.875 - 1.8125q, which at q = 0.25 is 0.4219, very close to the observed 0.4196. I therefore keep q tightly centered at 0.25 with low between-subject variance. The softmax temperatures are set near 5.25-5.50 rather than the provisional value of 1: with binary win-count margins of one to four, beta near 1 would make the Tallying strategy too likely to choose the losing option and would flatten both behavioral signatures. The nearly deterministic core strategies with zero lapse are required for the mixture algebra to reproduce both observed values simultaneously. This model contains pi_1 as the special case q = 1 and pi_2 as the special case q = 0, but the human data support an intermediate q of about 0.25.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0077 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0077.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate's trial-level mixture model reproduces both empirical signatures well. In Experiment 1 the candidate first-cue match rate is 0.2575 versus the observed 0.2487, while the two pure strategies give 0.8723 and 0.1175, so the data clearly require an intermediate probability of first-cue stopping near q = 0.25. In Experiment 2 the candidate gives 0.4148 versus the observed 0.4196, and the pure strategies bracket the data at -0.6075 and 0.6304. The point estimates are therefore very close in both experiments, with absolute deviations of about 0.009 and 0.005. The only noticeable mismatch is that the simulated between-subject variance is lower than the real variance in both experiments: 0.0018 versus 0.0065 in Experiment 1 and 0.0052 versus 0.0128 in Experiment 2. This suggests the candidate is somewhat underdispersed at the subject level, but the canonical metric values are captured accurately. The high softmax temperatures and zero lapse are more extreme than the arbiter's provisional beta_tally suggestion, but they remain inside the prescribed softmax-mixture family and are supported by the fit.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "Keep this theory. It implements the prescribed mechanism family faithfully: a probabilistic trial-level mixture of first-cue stopping and full tallying, with q concentrated near 0.25, negligible lapse, and the pure strategies recovered as special cases q = 0 and q = 1. The candidate matches both observed metrics closely and clearly improves on the two pure-strategy alternatives. The mild underdispersion does not warrant regeneration at this stage. If future experiments make subject-level variance a target, the natural in-family adjustment would be to widen the q and beta distributions slightly or reintroduce a small epsilon, without changing the mixture architecture."
