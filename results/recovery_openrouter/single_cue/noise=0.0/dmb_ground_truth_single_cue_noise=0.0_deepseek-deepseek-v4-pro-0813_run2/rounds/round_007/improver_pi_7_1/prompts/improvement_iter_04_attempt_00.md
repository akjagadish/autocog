# improvement_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a NEW model instantiation of an EXISTING theory, given arbiter feedback on the previous instantiation. The theory's prose claim is fixed — you are NOT redefining the theory. You are regenerating only the runnable bits: the `predict` function, the `policy` function, and the `parameters` ranges. The newly proposed model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The goal of the model improvement process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
If your model fails to compile or behaves badly, you may receive feedback and have to propose another instantiation. Iterate until accepted.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new model instance that ignores the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ROUND THEORIES
The arbiter compared the two theories below this round. Your job is to regenerate ONLY the runnable bits (`predict`, `policy`, `parameters`) of the one tagged **TO REVISE**, keeping its description verbatim. The other theory is shown for context — it is NOT being changed.

### THEORY 1 — `pi_6` (other theory — context only, NOT revised)

**Description:**
People choose between two products through a stable, subject-level mixture of three routes: a weak forward lexicographic scan, a moderate backward/recency lexicographic scan, and feature-win tallying. Choice is modulated by a context-sensitive amplification of a higher-precision backward lexicographic route. The decision maker monitors the trailing 24-trial frequency of fully diagnostic, near-tied-tally comparisons, ignores isolated occurrences via a minimum qualifying count, and maps the qualifying fraction through a band-limited trapezoidal sensitivity curve. Moderate densities of such trials produce the strongest backward amplification, which generates the strong negative top-cue effects seen in dense complementary designs; very high densities attenuate to a lower floor, protecting all-complementary blocks from over-reversal. Sparse designs that never contain fully diagnostic near-tied trials keep the trigger at exactly zero, so their behavior stays governed by the pi_4-like baseline mixture, preserving the near-zero active-inactive contrasts in those experiments.

### THEORY 2 — `pi_7` **TO REVISE**

**Description (PRESERVE VERBATIM — do not rewrite the prose):**
People choose between two products through a baseline mixture of a weak forward lexicographic scan, a moderate lowest-validity-first lexicographic scan, and feature-win tallying. Decision makers continuously accumulate local evidence about cue reliability from recent discriminating trials. Evidence is graded by discrimination density: near-tied trials with only a few discriminating features contribute little or nothing, while dense five-of-six or fully discriminating trials drive a leaky accumulator. The accumulator has asymmetric rise and decay, a minimum qualifying count, hysteresis, and smooth activation of a strengthened lowest-validity-first route. When fully discriminating trials dominate the local evidence stream, the reversed route is gently capped below its maximum so strongly complementary designs reverse strongly but not excessively. When dense conflict is sparse, evidence decays back to baseline mixture weights, preserving near-zero active-inactive contrasts in sparse designs.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_7`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_7`).

Keep pi_7's theory description (graded evidence accumulation from dense near-tied and full trials with asymmetric rise/decay, hysteresis, minimum qualifying count, and a capped strengthened lowest-validity-first route) and the probabilistic policy. Regenerate the predict function and parameter ranges so that: (1) five-of-six-only streams contribute only subthreshold evidence — lower base_evidence and hi_lo_bonus, raise conflict_threshold and min_qualifying_count to around 3-5, so Experiment 1 stays near zero; (2) mixed 50% full / 50% five-of-six contexts do not saturate — apply the full-evidence penalty at moderate full fractions by setting full_penalty_threshold around 0.35-0.55 and moderate full_penalty_depth, yielding effective s around 0.45-0.60 and an Experiment 2 aligned-vs-conflict gap near 0.60-0.66 instead of 0.80; (3) all-full or full-dominated contexts retain strong but capped reversal — keep the full-fraction penalty mild above roughly 0.8 and allow s near 0.65-0.80 so Experiments 15 and 16 stay above 0.80 low-cue consistency; (4) slow the activation dynamics slightly, with lower activation_rise, moderate activation_decay, and slower evidence_decay, to reduce block-position sensitivity and the E8 overshoot while preserving near-zero sparse-design contrasts. Re-simulate and target E1 around 0.04-0.06, E2 around 0.60-0.66, E8 around -0.64 to -0.68, and E15/E16 around 0.82-0.85, without disturbing the already close matches in E3-E7, E9-E14.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.732)

**Description**
People choose between two options through a stable, subject-level mixture of three comparison routes: (1) forward lexicographic scanning, inspecting cues in descending validity order and stopping at the first discriminating cue; (2) backward lexicographic scanning, inspecting cues in ascending validity order and stopping at the first discriminating cue in that reversed order; and (3) feature-win tallying, where each option receives one point per feature on which it strictly beats the other and ties contribute nothing. The forward and backward lexicographic weights jointly act as a subject-level polarity parameter for first-validity-cue effects: forward weight supports a positive first-discriminator effect, while backward weight supports a negative one. Each route's preferred option is passed through its own softmax choice rule, so responding is noisy but not controlled by a uniform lapse.

### `pi_5_2` (overall score: 0.527)

**Description**
People compare options through a conflict-gated dual-lexicographic/tallying system. A baseline mixture combines a weak forward Take-The-Best route, a moderate backward lexicographic route, and feature-win tallying. When the highest-validity and lowest-validity cues discriminate in opposite directions and the tally does not oppose the highest cue, the decision maker enters a conflict regime: tallying is suspended and the choice is made with high probability by a strong backward lexicographic scan over ascending validities. Subjects differ substantially in how strongly and deterministically they reverse on such conflict trials.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0860 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0771 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0799 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0852 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0771 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

`rationale`: This is a minimal recalibration of the pi_7 accumulator rather than a mechanism change. I made five-of-six evidence materially stronger by switching from linear density gain to a square-root gain and lowering density_floor to 0.75, so dense five-of-six conflicts accumulate instead of acting as subthreshold noise, while four-of-six sparse streams remain inactive. Conflict-specific evidence is raised as prescribed (hi_lo_bonus and base_evidence up, conflict_threshold down, slower evidence decay), which targets the weak E5/E6 top-cue reversal and the low E13/E14 low-cue use. The full-fraction penalty is now a bell centered at moderate full fractions via full_penalty_threshold/full_penalty_width: 50% full / 50% five-of-six streams are capped around effective s=0.55-0.60, fixing E16's aligned-vs-conflict overshoot, whereas high-full streams above roughly 0.8 receive only a mild penalty and stay near s=0.65-0.75. Activation rise is increased slightly and activation decay slowed, reducing block-position sensitivity and the E8/E15 overshoot while preserving the near-zero sparse-design contrasts.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a substantial improvement over earlier forward-lexicographic/tally baselines and already matches several experiments well: E1 (0.234 vs 0.249), E2 (0.444 vs 0.420), E3 (-0.133 vs -0.130), E4 (-0.298 vs -0.274), E8 (0.013 vs 0.015), and the near-zero sparse-design contrasts E9-E12 and E14 are all close. However, the graded evidence accumulator is miscalibrated exactly where it must discriminate dense conflict from sparse or mixed contexts. E6 is the most serious failure: the real top-cue reversal is -0.671 but the candidate produces only -0.310, roughly half the effect. E5 is also too weak (-0.566 vs -0.658), E7 is too top-consistent (0.299 vs 0.155), E13 under-uses the low-validity cue (0.685 vs 0.843), E15 shows too much block-position sensitivity (0.092 vs 0.055), and E16 has too large an aligned-vs-conflict gap (0.779 vs 0.641). These are not random misses; they cluster around exactly the two mechanisms the theory is supposed to control: when the reversed route turns on and how strongly.
Rationale: Regenerate with the same evidence-accumulation mechanism, but recalibrate two interacting components. (1) The full-fraction penalty gate is effectively inert in mixed contexts because full_penalty_threshold was set to [0.85, 0.95], whereas the prescribed mechanism called for a threshold around 0.35-0.55. As a result S saturates in E16's mixed half-full streams, producing the 0.779 gap instead of the observed 0.641. Restore a threshold near 0.35-0.50 and reformulate/re-tune the penalty so that full_frac around 0.4-0.6 reduces effective s to roughly 0.45-0.60, while full-dominated streams above roughly 0.8 remain only mildly capped with s near 0.65-0.80. The current normalized-excess penalty is too weak at moderate full fractions, so either use a direct multiplier or a bell/saturating form. (2) Dense conflict activation is now too weak. Raise conflict-specific evidence and slow leakage so E5/E6/E13 reach stronger reversed-route use: e.g., hi_lo_bonus 0.25-0.35, base_evidence 0.38-0.50, conflict_threshold 0.03-0.05, evidence_rise 0.35-0.45, evidence_decay 0.05-0.08, activation_rise 0.22-0.30, activation_decay 0.04-0.07, and keep min_qualifying_count at 3-4. Also make the 5-of-6 density contribution less negligible—such as a square-root density gain or density_floor 0.75—so dense five-of-six conflicts in six-feature designs accumulate materially while sparse four-of-six streams remain inactive. Keep the baseline mixture and probabilistic policy unchanged and verify that E1/E2/E3/E4 and the near-zero sparse contrasts do not move far from their current good values.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0860 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0771 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate stays inside the prescribed graded-evidence-accumulator family and is an accepted improvement over the prior iteration (aggregate loss 0.086 -> 0.077). It continues to match several sparse/near-zero designs well: E1 (0.238 vs 0.249), E3 (-0.123 vs -0.130), E4 (-0.296 vs -0.274), E8 (-0.000 vs 0.015), E10 (-0.001 vs -0.001), and E15 is acceptable (0.021 vs 0.055). However, the remaining misses are systematic and not random. The accumulator now over-reverses in fully discriminating / full-dominated contexts: E5 (-0.768 vs -0.658), E14 (0.888 vs 0.841), and E16 (0.738 vs 0.641) all show the strengthened backward route saturating too strongly, and E2 has drifted substantially upward (0.498 vs 0.420). At the same time it still under-reverses in dense-but-not-fully-discriminating contexts: E6 remains a large miss (-0.475 vs -0.671) and E13 still under-uses the low-validity cue (0.788 vs 0.843). E7 is also too top-consistent (0.225 vs 0.155). The near-zero sparse contrasts E9/E11/E12 have moved modestly positive, suggesting some leakage from the recalibrated evidence gain into contexts that should stay inactive. Overall the candidate is close in architecture but miscalibrated in the two places the theory is supposed to discriminate: the density mapping between five-of-six and fully-discriminating trials, and the full-fraction cap.
Rationale: Regenerate with the same pi_7 mechanism, but recalibrate rather than globally strengthen. (1) The full-fraction penalty is still too weak at high full fractions: the current Gaussian penalty is essentially zero at full_frac=1, allowing s to approach s_max ~0.79 and producing overshooting in E5/E14/E16. Add a nonzero full-fraction penalty floor or reshape the penalty so streams with full_frac >= 0.8 retain a mild cap around 0.10-0.18, and consider lowering s_max to about 0.68-0.74. (2) Increase evidence from five-of-six / near-full trials relative to fully-discriminating trials: use a less concave density gain (e.g., exponent around 0.35-0.45 or lower density_floor to ~0.70) or add a near-full boost for density in [0.80, 1.0). This should raise E6 and E13 toward their observed values without further inflating all-full designs. (3) Do not globally increase hi_lo_bonus, base_evidence, or activation strength further: E5 shows the previous global strengthening has crossed its optimum. (4) Slightly rebalance the baseline mixture to correct E2: increase w_forward by a few points and reduce w_tally/w_backward correspondingly, but monitor E1 and E13 because they depend on the same weights. (5) Check that the revised density gain keeps sparse four-or-fewer discriminating streams subthreshold so E1 and the near-zero contrasts E9-E12 do not drift further positive.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0771 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0799 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate stays inside the prescribed evidence-accumulator family and the diagnosis of its author is partially correct: the all-full over-reversal is largely cured (E5 -0.636 vs -0.658, E14 0.839 vs 0.841, E16 0.688 vs 0.641 vs the iter-2 base's 0.738), and E4 becomes essentially perfect (-0.275 vs -0.274). But these gains were bought with a blunt global cap — a penalty floor applied at every full fraction plus s_max lowered to 0.70-0.74 — which throttled the reversed route exactly in the contexts that must stay strong. The systematic regressions relative to the accepted iter-2 base are: E6 -0.475 to -0.406 (real -0.671), E13 0.788 to 0.734 (real 0.843), E7 0.225 to 0.253 (real 0.155), E15 0.021 to -0.038 (real 0.055, sign flip), and E11 0.033 to 0.086 (real -0.005). The aggregate gate rejected the candidate (0.0799 vs 0.0771). The candidate is therefore close in architecture but its cap is too broad: it cannot distinguish all-full streams, which should be mildly capped, from dense five-of-six/mixed streams, which need s near 0.45-0.60 to express E6/E13/E7, and it flattens E15's block-position contrast by diluting the recent full fraction with the whole session history.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base, not on this rejected cap. (1) Restore s_max to roughly 0.76-0.80 and replace the everywhere-floor with a high-end-only penalty: negligible below full_frac ~0.70-0.75, rising to about 0.15-0.20 at full_frac = 1.0 (e.g. a narrow Gaussian centered near 0.9-0.95 or a monotone power in (full_frac-0.75)/0.25). This keeps iter-3's E5/E14/E16 wins while leaving mixed ~0.4-0.6 full-fraction streams unpenalized so E6/E13/E7 can recover. (2) Compute full_frac over a recent window (about the last 16-24 trials) instead of cumulatively since trial 0; E15's -0.038 sign flip shows the cumulative fraction erases local block-position sensitivity, and a windowed fraction is a faithful gating fix within the mechanism. Keep a mild floor only if needed for all-full streams, not as a global shave. (3) Keep the five-of-six evidence lift (near_full_boost ~1.08-1.15 and density exponent ~0.40) but do not raise base_evidence, hi_lo_bonus, or activation strength any further — prior global strengthening has reached its useful upper end and the E6 gap in iter-3 was caused by the cap masking this lift, not by the lift being too small. (4) Address sparse leakage (E11 0.086, E12) without touching the baseline weights: set min_qualifying_count to 5 (upper end of the arbiter's 3-5 band) or require a windowed qualifying count such as 4 dense trials within the last 16, which kills the handful of fully-discriminating trials inside E11's otherwise sparse stream while leaving E6/E13/E15/E16 dense streams active; verify E1 stays near 0.24-0.25. (5) Shrink or revert the w_forward/w_backward rebalance: it helped E1/E4 but leaked into E11; either restore the iter-2 weights or use w_forward ~0.26-0.30, and if E2 remains ~0.47-0.50 against the real 0.42, adjust beta_tally/epsilon or the lexicographic betas rather than the mixture weights again. Re-simulate and target E6 near -0.62 to -0.67, E13 near 0.82-0.84, E7 near 0.16-0.19, E15 near 0.03-0.06, E11/E12 near 0, while holding E5/E14/E16 at their newly fixed levels.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0799 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0852 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is a genuine improvement on the iter-3 cap in some places—E5 (-0.647 vs -0.658), E7 (0.167 vs 0.155), and E14 (0.831 vs 0.841) are now close—but overall it was rejected by the gate (0.0852 vs the accepted 0.0771). The remaining errors are systematic, not random. E16 is badly over-reversed: 0.831 against the real 0.641, the largest single miss. E6 is still too shallow: -0.501 against -0.671. E13 under-uses the low-validity cue: 0.717 against 0.843. The sparse contrasts E9/E11/E12 all leak positive (0.021, 0.058, 0.027 against roughly 0), and E15's block-position effect remains too weak (0.013 vs 0.055). The root cause is a mismatch between the density gate and the full-fraction penalty: the candidate excludes exactly the dense-but-not-fully-discriminating conflict trials needed for E6/E13 via density_floor=0.75 and min_qualifying_count=5, while near_full_boost lets five-of-six streams in E16's moderate full-fraction windows puff up unpenalized because the high-end-only threshold at 0.72-0.78 barely engages there. That threshold is the inverse of the shape the data seem to demand: E16 needs a cap at moderate full dominance, while all-full streams such as E5/E14 need only a mild cap.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base, not on this rejected candidate. Do not re-use the previous high-end-only cap or the min_qualifying_count=5 recommendation; that combination was just rejected, largely because it did not penalize E16's moderate full-fraction windows while starving E6/E13. In-family changes to try instead: (1) Replace the hard density_floor=0.75 with a conflict-gated, lower floor around 0.55-0.65: for non-full trials, contribute evidence only when the highest- and lowest-validity cues disagree and density exceeds the lower floor; fully discriminating trials are exempt. This admits the 4/6 and 5/6 dense conflict trials that drive E6/E13, while denying the non-conflict dense trials behind the E1/E9/E11/E12 leakage. (2) Reduce near_full_boost to 1.00-1.05 and compensate with a higher hi_lo_bonus around 0.45-0.55 and/or a lower saturation_evidence around 0.30-0.38, so dense conflict activates strongly without making five-of-six streams as potent as all-full streams. (3) Lower min_qualifying_count to 4 and optionally make the qualifying window 12-16 trials, counting conflict/full evidence rather than any positive evidence; that keeps E6/E13/E15 active while suppressing sparse residual activation. (4) Replace the monotone high-end-only full penalty with a peaked penalty: active from full_frac around 0.35-0.45, reaching its maximum depth of about 0.25-0.35 around full_frac 0.55-0.70, then declining to only about 0.08-0.15 at full_frac near 1.0. This caps E16's mixed/full-dominated windows while leaving all-full E5/E14 through mild reversal. (5) If sparse leakage persists, increase zero_decay_boost to about 2.5-4.0 or activation_decay when target is zero, but do not make decay so fast that E15's local block contrast disappears. Leave the baseline mixture and beta_tally roughly at their current near-fitting values until the evidence gate and full penalty have been re-tuned. Target E6 near -0.65, E13 near 0.82-0.84, E16 near 0.64-0.68, and E9/E11/E12 back near 0, while preserving the current good E2, E3, E4, E5, E7, E8, and E14.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0852 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep the theory's prose claim implicit but unchanged, and keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "rationale": "This edit keeps the accepted pi_7 accumulator but changes its gating rather than its global strength. Non-full evidence is now conflict-gated: it contributes only when the highest- and lowest-validity cues disagree and density exceeds a lowered floor around 0.55-0.65, while fully discriminating trials are exempt. Activation is decided by qualifying evidence in a recent 16-trial window with a minimum count of four, suppressing the sparse leakage in E9/E11/E12 and the E2 drift without erasing local block effects. Dense conflict is made potent through higher hi_lo_bonus and lower saturation_evidence; near-full trials receive only a small boost so they do not mimic all-full trials. The full-fraction penalty is now a peaked, local 24-trial penalty: strong near moderate full fractions to cap E16, with only a mild floor near full dominance so E5/E14 reverse strongly but not excessively. A slightly lower s_max and weaker beta_backward_strong reduce the remaining all-full over-reversal while preserving low-cue use in E13."
