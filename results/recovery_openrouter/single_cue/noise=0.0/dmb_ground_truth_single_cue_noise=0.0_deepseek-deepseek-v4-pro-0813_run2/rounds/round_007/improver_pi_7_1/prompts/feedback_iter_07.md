# feedback_iter_07

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_7`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_7`).

Keep pi_7's theory description (graded evidence accumulation from dense near-tied and full trials with asymmetric rise/decay, hysteresis, minimum qualifying count, and a capped strengthened lowest-validity-first route) and the probabilistic policy. Regenerate the predict function and parameter ranges so that: (1) five-of-six-only streams contribute only subthreshold evidence — lower base_evidence and hi_lo_bonus, raise conflict_threshold and min_qualifying_count to around 3-5, so Experiment 1 stays near zero; (2) mixed 50% full / 50% five-of-six contexts do not saturate — apply the full-evidence penalty at moderate full fractions by setting full_penalty_threshold around 0.35-0.55 and moderate full_penalty_depth, yielding effective s around 0.45-0.60 and an Experiment 2 aligned-vs-conflict gap near 0.60-0.66 instead of 0.80; (3) all-full or full-dominated contexts retain strong but capped reversal — keep the full-fraction penalty mild above roughly 0.8 and allow s near 0.65-0.80 so Experiments 15 and 16 stay above 0.80 low-cue consistency; (4) slow the activation dynamics slightly, with lower activation_rise, moderate activation_decay, and slower evidence_decay, to reduce block-position sensitivity and the E8 overshoot while preserving near-zero sparse-design contrasts. Re-simulate and target E1 around 0.04-0.06, E2 around 0.60-0.66, E8 around -0.64 to -0.68, and E15/E16 around 0.82-0.85, without disturbing the already close matches in E3-E7, E9-E14.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People choose between two products through a baseline mixture of a weak forward lexicographic scan, a moderate lowest-validity-first lexicographic scan, and feature-win tallying. Decision makers continuously accumulate local evidence about cue reliability from recent discriminating trials. Evidence is graded by discrimination density: near-tied trials with only a few discriminating features contribute little or nothing, while dense five-of-six or fully discriminating trials drive a leaky accumulator. The accumulator has asymmetric rise and decay, a minimum qualifying count, hysteresis, and smooth activation of a strengthened lowest-validity-first route. When fully discriminating trials dominate the local evidence stream, the reversed route is gently capped below its maximum so strongly complementary designs reverse strongly but not excessively. When dense conflict is sparse, evidence decays back to baseline mixture weights, preserving near-zero active-inactive contrasts in sparse designs.

`rationale`:
This is a parameter-only, minimal-diff edit on the accepted iter-7 base, applying exactly the decoupled recalibrations requested in the latest feedback while leaving the predict/policy mechanism untouched. Dense non-full conflict activation is lifted for E6/E13 by raising near_full_boost to [1.06, 1.12], lowering saturation_evidence to [0.22, 0.28], and raising hysteresis to [0.04, 0.07]; these changes strengthen the reversed route in dense but partly-tied conflict streams without any global base-evidence or activation-rise increase that previously caused all-full over-reversal. The full-fraction penalty is sharpened only at moderate full fractions: full_penalty_threshold moves to [0.45, 0.55] and full_penalty_depth to [0.25, 0.32], which caps E16's aligned-vs-conflict gap, while the mild full_penalty_floor [0.04, 0.10] is preserved so all-full designs such as E5/E14 keep only a gentle cap. All other declared ranges remain at their accepted iter-7 values, including the tally-alignment gate, windowed full-fraction computation, min_qualifying_count {4}, and slowed activation dynamics, protecting the already-good matches in E1-E5, E7-E12, E14, and E15.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0860 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0771 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0799 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0852 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.0613 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 6: loss=0.0770 -> REJECTED
- iter 7: loss=0.0437 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 8 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0603 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 7 at loss=0.0437.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is a substantial improvement over earlier forward-lexicographic/tally baselines and already matches several experiments well: E1 (0.234 vs 0.249), E2 (0.444 vs 0.420), E3 (-0.133 vs -0.130), E4 (-0.298 vs -0.274), E8 (0.013 vs 0.015), and the near-zero sparse-design contrasts E9-E12 and E14 are all close. However, the graded evidence accumulator is miscalibrated exactly where it must discriminate dense conflict from sparse or mixed contexts. E6 is the most serious failure: the real top-cue reversal is -0.671 but the candidate produces only -0.310, roughly half the effect. E5 is also too weak (-0.566 vs -0.658), E7 is too top-consistent (0.299 vs 0.155), E13 under-uses the low-validity cue (0.685 vs 0.843), E15 shows too much block-position sensitivity (0.092 vs 0.055), and E16 has too large an aligned-vs-conflict gap (0.779 vs 0.641). These are not random misses; they cluster around exactly the two mechanisms the theory is supposed to control: when the reversed route turns on and how strongly.
Rationale: Regenerate with the same evidence-accumulation mechanism, but recalibrate two interacting components. (1) The full-fraction penalty gate is effectively inert in mixed contexts because full_penalty_threshold was set to [0.85, 0.95], whereas the prescribed mechanism called for a threshold around 0.35-0.55. As a result S saturates in E16's mixed half-full streams, producing the 0.779 gap instead of the observed 0.641. Restore a threshold near 0.35-0.50 and reformulate/re-tune the penalty so that full_frac around 0.4-0.6 reduces effective s to roughly 0.45-0.60, while full-dominated streams above roughly 0.8 remain only mildly capped with s near 0.65-0.80. The current normalized-excess penalty is too weak at moderate full fractions, so either use a direct multiplier or a bell/saturating form. (2) Dense conflict activation is now too weak. Raise conflict-specific evidence and slow leakage so E5/E6/E13 reach stronger reversed-route use: e.g., hi_lo_bonus 0.25-0.35, base_evidence 0.38-0.50, conflict_threshold 0.03-0.05, evidence_rise 0.35-0.45, evidence_decay 0.05-0.08, activation_rise 0.22-0.30, activation_decay 0.04-0.07, and keep min_qualifying_count at 3-4. Also make the 5-of-6 density contribution less negligible—such as a square-root density gain or density_floor 0.75—so dense five-of-six conflicts in six-feature designs accumulate materially while sparse four-of-six streams remain inactive. Keep the baseline mixture and probabilistic policy unchanged and verify that E1/E2/E3/E4 and the near-zero sparse contrasts do not move far from their current good values.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0860 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0771 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate stays inside the prescribed graded-evidence-accumulator family and is an accepted improvement over the prior iteration (aggregate loss 0.086 -> 0.077). It continues to match several sparse/near-zero designs well: E1 (0.238 vs 0.249), E3 (-0.123 vs -0.130), E4 (-0.296 vs -0.274), E8 (-0.000 vs 0.015), E10 (-0.001 vs -0.001), and E15 is acceptable (0.021 vs 0.055). However, the remaining misses are systematic and not random. The accumulator now over-reverses in fully discriminating / full-dominated contexts: E5 (-0.768 vs -0.658), E14 (0.888 vs 0.841), and E16 (0.738 vs 0.641) all show the strengthened backward route saturating too strongly, and E2 has drifted substantially upward (0.498 vs 0.420). At the same time it still under-reverses in dense-but-not-fully-discriminating contexts: E6 remains a large miss (-0.475 vs -0.671) and E13 still under-uses the low-validity cue (0.788 vs 0.843). E7 is also too top-consistent (0.225 vs 0.155). The near-zero sparse contrasts E9/E11/E12 have moved modestly positive, suggesting some leakage from the recalibrated evidence gain into contexts that should stay inactive. Overall the candidate is close in architecture but miscalibrated in the two places the theory is supposed to discriminate: the density mapping between five-of-six and fully-discriminating trials, and the full-fraction cap.
Rationale: Regenerate with the same pi_7 mechanism, but recalibrate rather than globally strengthen. (1) The full-fraction penalty is still too weak at high full fractions: the current Gaussian penalty is essentially zero at full_frac=1, allowing s to approach s_max ~0.79 and producing overshooting in E5/E14/E16. Add a nonzero full-fraction penalty floor or reshape the penalty so streams with full_frac >= 0.8 retain a mild cap around 0.10-0.18, and consider lowering s_max to about 0.68-0.74. (2) Increase evidence from five-of-six / near-full trials relative to fully-discriminating trials: use a less concave density gain (e.g., exponent around 0.35-0.45 or lower density_floor to ~0.70) or add a near-full boost for density in [0.80, 1.0). This should raise E6 and E13 toward their observed values without further inflating all-full designs. (3) Do not globally increase hi_lo_bonus, base_evidence, or activation strength further: E5 shows the previous global strengthening has crossed its optimum. (4) Slightly rebalance the baseline mixture to correct E2: increase w_forward by a few points and reduce w_tally/w_backward correspondingly, but monitor E1 and E13 because they depend on the same weights. (5) Check that the revised density gain keeps sparse four-or-fewer discriminating streams subthreshold so E1 and the near-zero contrasts E9-E12 do not drift further positive.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0771 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0799 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate stays inside the prescribed evidence-accumulator family and the diagnosis of its author is partially correct: the all-full over-reversal is largely cured (E5 -0.636 vs -0.658, E14 0.839 vs 0.841, E16 0.688 vs 0.641 vs the iter-2 base's 0.738), and E4 becomes essentially perfect (-0.275 vs -0.274). But these gains were bought with a blunt global cap — a penalty floor applied at every full fraction plus s_max lowered to 0.70-0.74 — which throttled the reversed route exactly in the contexts that must stay strong. The systematic regressions relative to the accepted iter-2 base are: E6 -0.475 to -0.406 (real -0.671), E13 0.788 to 0.734 (real 0.843), E7 0.225 to 0.253 (real 0.155), E15 0.021 to -0.038 (real 0.055, sign flip), and E11 0.033 to 0.086 (real -0.005). The aggregate gate rejected the candidate (0.0799 vs 0.0771). The candidate is therefore close in architecture but its cap is too broad: it cannot distinguish all-full streams, which should be mildly capped, from dense five-of-six/mixed streams, which need s near 0.45-0.60 to express E6/E13/E7, and it flattens E15's block-position contrast by diluting the recent full fraction with the whole session history.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base, not on this rejected cap. (1) Restore s_max to roughly 0.76-0.80 and replace the everywhere-floor with a high-end-only penalty: negligible below full_frac ~0.70-0.75, rising to about 0.15-0.20 at full_frac = 1.0 (e.g. a narrow Gaussian centered near 0.9-0.95 or a monotone power in (full_frac-0.75)/0.25). This keeps iter-3's E5/E14/E16 wins while leaving mixed ~0.4-0.6 full-fraction streams unpenalized so E6/E13/E7 can recover. (2) Compute full_frac over a recent window (about the last 16-24 trials) instead of cumulatively since trial 0; E15's -0.038 sign flip shows the cumulative fraction erases local block-position sensitivity, and a windowed fraction is a faithful gating fix within the mechanism. Keep a mild floor only if needed for all-full streams, not as a global shave. (3) Keep the five-of-six evidence lift (near_full_boost ~1.08-1.15 and density exponent ~0.40) but do not raise base_evidence, hi_lo_bonus, or activation strength any further — prior global strengthening has reached its useful upper end and the E6 gap in iter-3 was caused by the cap masking this lift, not by the lift being too small. (4) Address sparse leakage (E11 0.086, E12) without touching the baseline weights: set min_qualifying_count to 5 (upper end of the arbiter's 3-5 band) or require a windowed qualifying count such as 4 dense trials within the last 16, which kills the handful of fully-discriminating trials inside E11's otherwise sparse stream while leaving E6/E13/E15/E16 dense streams active; verify E1 stays near 0.24-0.25. (5) Shrink or revert the w_forward/w_backward rebalance: it helped E1/E4 but leaked into E11; either restore the iter-2 weights or use w_forward ~0.26-0.30, and if E2 remains ~0.47-0.50 against the real 0.42, adjust beta_tally/epsilon or the lexicographic betas rather than the mixture weights again. Re-simulate and target E6 near -0.62 to -0.67, E13 near 0.82-0.84, E7 near 0.16-0.19, E15 near 0.03-0.06, E11/E12 near 0, while holding E5/E14/E16 at their newly fixed levels.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0799 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0852 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is a genuine improvement on the iter-3 cap in some places—E5 (-0.647 vs -0.658), E7 (0.167 vs 0.155), and E14 (0.831 vs 0.841) are now close—but overall it was rejected by the gate (0.0852 vs the accepted 0.0771). The remaining errors are systematic, not random. E16 is badly over-reversed: 0.831 against the real 0.641, the largest single miss. E6 is still too shallow: -0.501 against -0.671. E13 under-uses the low-validity cue: 0.717 against 0.843. The sparse contrasts E9/E11/E12 all leak positive (0.021, 0.058, 0.027 against roughly 0), and E15's block-position effect remains too weak (0.013 vs 0.055). The root cause is a mismatch between the density gate and the full-fraction penalty: the candidate excludes exactly the dense-but-not-fully-discriminating conflict trials needed for E6/E13 via density_floor=0.75 and min_qualifying_count=5, while near_full_boost lets five-of-six streams in E16's moderate full-fraction windows puff up unpenalized because the high-end-only threshold at 0.72-0.78 barely engages there. That threshold is the inverse of the shape the data seem to demand: E16 needs a cap at moderate full dominance, while all-full streams such as E5/E14 need only a mild cap.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-2 base, not on this rejected candidate. Do not re-use the previous high-end-only cap or the min_qualifying_count=5 recommendation; that combination was just rejected, largely because it did not penalize E16's moderate full-fraction windows while starving E6/E13. In-family changes to try instead: (1) Replace the hard density_floor=0.75 with a conflict-gated, lower floor around 0.55-0.65: for non-full trials, contribute evidence only when the highest- and lowest-validity cues disagree and density exceeds the lower floor; fully discriminating trials are exempt. This admits the 4/6 and 5/6 dense conflict trials that drive E6/E13, while denying the non-conflict dense trials behind the E1/E9/E11/E12 leakage. (2) Reduce near_full_boost to 1.00-1.05 and compensate with a higher hi_lo_bonus around 0.45-0.55 and/or a lower saturation_evidence around 0.30-0.38, so dense conflict activates strongly without making five-of-six streams as potent as all-full streams. (3) Lower min_qualifying_count to 4 and optionally make the qualifying window 12-16 trials, counting conflict/full evidence rather than any positive evidence; that keeps E6/E13/E15 active while suppressing sparse residual activation. (4) Replace the monotone high-end-only full penalty with a peaked penalty: active from full_frac around 0.35-0.45, reaching its maximum depth of about 0.25-0.35 around full_frac 0.55-0.70, then declining to only about 0.08-0.15 at full_frac near 1.0. This caps E16's mixed/full-dominated windows while leaving all-full E5/E14 through mild reversal. (5) If sparse leakage persists, increase zero_decay_boost to about 2.5-4.0 or activation_decay when target is zero, but do not make decay so fast that E15's local block contrast disappears. Leave the baseline mixture and beta_tally roughly at their current near-fitting values until the evidence gate and full penalty have been re-tuned. Target E6 near -0.65, E13 near 0.82-0.84, E16 near 0.64-0.68, and E9/E11/E12 back near 0, while preserving the current good E2, E3, E4, E5, E7, E8, and E14.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0852 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.0613 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: This candidate is the best in the loop so far (aggregate loss 0.0613 vs. prior best 0.0771) and the accepted gating changes fixed several previously stuck experiments: E3, E4, E7, E8, E10, and especially E14 are now essentially on target. However, the remaining errors are systematic rather than noise. E1 is far too anti-TTB (0.121 vs. 0.249), meaning the sparse/dense five-of-six stream still activates the reversed route instead of staying near the baseline mixture. E6 remains too shallow (-0.587 vs. -0.671) and E13 under-uses the low-validity cue (0.743 vs. 0.843), while E5 over-reverses (-0.724 vs. -0.658) and E16 still shows too large an aligned-vs-conflict gap (0.723 vs. 0.641). E15's block-position sensitivity is also too weak (0.023 vs. 0.055). These misses cluster around the same two components the theory is supposed to control: how strongly dense non-full conflict drives the accumulator, and how the full-fraction penalty caps reversal without killing it.
Rationale: Stay inside the pi_7 graded-evidence-accumulator family and make targeted recalibrations. (1) Sharpen density selectivity: allow 5-of-6 conflict trials to contribute substantially but make 4-of-6 five-of-six streams subthreshold. Raise density_floor toward 0.65-0.72 and make the density gain steeper (e.g., squaring or near_full_boost 1.05-1.15) instead of the current sqrt gain. This should move E1 back toward 0.22-0.25 and lift E13 without the hard density_floor=0.75/min_qualifying_count=5 move that was rejected earlier. (2) Strengthen dense non-full conflict evidence for E6/E13 by raising hi_lo_bonus toward 0.55-0.70 and lowering saturation_evidence toward 0.20-0.28, while keeping base_evidence for full trials moderate to avoid further E5 saturation. (3) Strengthen the peaked full-fraction penalty: increase full_penalty_depth to 0.35-0.45 and full_penalty_floor to 0.15-0.22, and consider centering around 0.50-0.60 so E16's moderate full-fraction windows are capped harder; monitor E14 so it stays near 0.84. This is a sharper version of the accepted peaked penalty, not the rejected global cap. (4) Rebalance the baseline mixture slightly for E1/E2: raise w_forward toward 0.30-0.36 and/or beta_forward toward 0.20-0.28, which should increase first-cue agreement in sparse contexts and pull E2 from 0.456 toward 0.42. (5) Re-strengthen local dynamics modestly for E15: activation_rise toward 0.26-0.34 and activation_decay/evidence_decay slightly faster, while preserving a strong zero-decay boost so sparse contrasts stay near zero. Re-simulate and target E1 ~0.22-0.25, E6 ~ -0.65 to -0.67, E13 ~0.82-0.84, E16 ~0.63-0.66, and E15 ~0.04-0.06, while holding the now-excellent E3/E4/E7/E8/E10/E14 matches.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.0613 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.0770 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 6
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate fixes E1 (0.276 vs 0.249 real) and E5 (-0.649 vs -0.658 real) nicely, but it does so by overcorrecting the accepted iter-5 base and regressing several previously good fits. The failures are systematic: E6 collapses to -0.437 against -0.671 real (accepted base was -0.587), E7 moves to 0.217 against 0.155 real, the sparse/near-zero contrasts E9-E12 drift positive, E15 weakens to 0.011 against 0.055 real, and E16 worsens to 0.739 against 0.641 real. E13 remains stuck too low at 0.743 against 0.843. The aggregate gate correctly rejected it (0.0770 vs accepted 0.0613). The likely mechanism is an interacting pair of changes from my prior advice: raising density_floor to 0.68-0.72 removes 4-of-6 conflict evidence, and because full_frac is computed only over positive-evidence trials, the surviving positives look full-dominated; the strengthened peaked full-fraction penalty then engages and caps S exactly in E6's dense mixed streams. The baseline forward shift (w_forward 0.30-0.36) also globally suppresses reversal/top-consistency contrasts, and raising beta_backward_strong widens E16's aligned-vs-conflict gap.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iter-5 base and avoid the rejected sharpening moves. (1) Do not keep density_floor 0.68-0.72 with squared gain; return to a conflict-gated floor around 0.55-0.62 so 4/6 dense conflict trials in E6/E13 contribute. (2) Fix the full-fraction normalization: compute full_frac over all recent trials in the window, not just trials that produced positive evidence, so excluded sparse trials cannot make a mixed stream look full-dominated and trigger the penalty in E6. (3) Use a smaller and different E1 fix than the rejected w_forward push: set w_forward around 0.25-0.28 rather than 0.30-0.36, possibly with beta_forward in the upper part of its current range, to keep E1 near 0.23-0.26 without flattening E6/E7. (4) Do not strengthen the full-fraction penalty again; use a shallower peak (depth roughly 0.15-0.25, floor <= 0.10) and, if E5/E14 start overshooting, trim full-trial base evidence or s_max instead of deepening the penalty. (5) Lower beta_backward_strong from 3.60-4.00 back toward roughly 3.20-3.60 to reduce E16's aligned-vs-conflict gap; E13 should be raised via accumulated evidence s, not by making the shifted route steeper. (6) For E15, instead of the rejected faster activation rates, keep iter-5 activation dynamics and shorten full_frac_window to about 12-16, or adjust the zero-target decay, so local full-trial blocks leave clearer block-position contrast. Targets: E1 ~0.23-0.26, E6 ~ -0.63 to -0.67, E7 ~0.15, E9-E12 near 0, E13 ~0.80-0.84, E15 ~0.04-0.06, E16 ~0.64-0.68, while holding the already good E2-E5, E8, E10 and E14 matches.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.0770 -> iter 7 candidate loss=0.0437 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 7 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The iter-7 candidate is by far the best in this loop (aggregate loss 0.0437 vs the previous accepted 0.0613) and is faithful to the arbiter's prescribed family for pi_7: graded evidence accumulation, conflict/tally gating, small min_qualifying_count (4), a moderate peaked full-fraction penalty around 0.50-0.60, and slowed activation dynamics. It nails the baseline and sparse/near-zero structure: E1 (0.235 vs 0.249), E2 (0.441 vs 0.420), E3 (-0.138 vs -0.130), E4 (-0.297 vs -0.274), E7 (0.166 vs 0.155), E8 (0.023 vs 0.015), E10 (-0.002 vs -0.001), E11 (0.008 vs -0.005), E12 (0.002 vs -0.018), E14 (0.842 vs 0.841), and E15 (0.042 vs 0.055) are all essentially on target. The remaining misses are systematic and concentrated in the mechanism the theory is meant to control: E6 under-reverses (-0.562 vs -0.671), E13 under-uses the lowest-validity cue (0.762 vs 0.843), and E16's aligned-vs-conflict gap is still too wide (0.733 vs 0.641). E5 also slightly over-reverses (-0.693 vs -0.658) and E9 drifts mildly positive (0.003 vs -0.028), but both are small. The three larger misses all trace to the same trade-off: dense non-full conflict evidence is still a bit too weak (E6/E13), while the moderate full-fraction cap does not bite strongly enough in E16's frac>=0.5 windows. Because the accept gate now protects this strong base, one more targeted in-family calibration round is low-risk and could close the last three gaps without disturbing the thirteen already-good matches.
Rationale: Keep the iter-7 predict/policy exactly as is and make only minor, decoupled parameter tweaks. (1) Lift dense non-full conflict activation for E6/E13 without any global boost that would overshoot all-full E5/E14: raise near_full_boost to about [1.06, 1.12], lower saturation_evidence slightly to [0.22, 0.28], and raise hysteresis to [0.04, 0.07] so activation sustains across mixed streams. Do NOT raise hi_lo_bonus above 0.55, base_evidence, or activation_rise (prior global strengthening was rejected); if E6 is still short after these, drop min_qualifying_count from 4 to 3 (inside the arbiter's 3-5 band) since the new tally-alignment gate already protects E1 and the sparse contrasts. (2) Close E16's aligned-vs-conflict gap via a somewhat deeper peaked full-fraction penalty at MODERATE full fractions only: raise full_penalty_depth toward [0.25, 0.32] and center toward [0.45, 0.55], but keep full_penalty_floor at [0.04, 0.10] so all-full streams (E5/E14) stay only mildly capped. This is a smaller step than the rejected 0.35-0.45 depth / 0.15-0.22 floor and a different knob combination than the rejected density_floor=0.68-0.72 plus w_forward=0.30-0.36 package. E13 has a low full-trial fraction so this penalty will barely engage there, preserving its gains. (3) Leave untouched: w_forward [0.25, 0.28] and the rest of the baseline mixture, beta_backward_strong [2.9, 3.3], density_floor [0.56, 0.62], the tally-alignment gate, full_frac computed over all recent trials with the 16-trial window, and the current activation dynamics (iteration-6 feedback direction was accepted; do not undo it). (4) Monitor only: E5 should not go below about -0.69, E9/E11/E12 should stay within +/-0.03 of zero, and E14/E7 should remain within +/-0.02 of their current excellent values. Targets after re-simulation: E6 near -0.64 to -0.67, E13 near 0.80-0.84, E16 near 0.64-0.68, with all thirteen currently good fits held flat.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 7 candidate loss=0.0437 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0603 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

The intended beneficiaries did not move: E6 stayed near -0.558 (real -0.671), and E13 stayed near 0.762 (real 0.843). The likely mechanism is that the global dense-conflict boost (higher near_full_boost, lower saturation_evidence, higher hysteresis) leaked into sparse and block-position designs, while E13's dense top-tied trials still return zero evidence because the non-full evidence gate requires the highest cue itself to discriminate. The moderate full-fraction penalty was therefore applied to contexts where evidence was not the limiting factor, producing regressions without fixing E6/E13.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Build on the accepted iter-7 base, not on this rejected candidate. First, revert the global activation changes that caused the E8/E9/E10/E15 regression: return near_full_boost, saturation_evidence, and hysteresis to their iter-7 values; do not lower saturation or inflate the dense-conflict boost again. Second, decouple all-full from mixed/near-full contexts: slightly raise s_max (e.g. 0.78-0.84) while increasing the high-full-fraction penalty floor (e.g. 0.10-0.16 when full_frac >= 0.8). This allows E6/E13, which have low-to-moderate full fractions, to use a stronger reversed route, while keeping all-full E5/E14/E16 capped. Keep the moderate-fraction penalty shallow as in iter-7; do not repeat the rejected deeper 0.25-0.32 penalty centered at 0.45-0.55. Third, fix the top-tied evidence gap inside the same mechanism: in the non-full branch, when the highest-validity cue is tied, use the first discriminating cue in descending validity order as the effective high cue, and only then require it to oppose the lowest cue under the existing near/tally/density gates. E13 has many dense top-tied conflict trials that currently emit zero evidence; this targeted gate correction should raise E13 and possibly help E6 without changing already-qualifying sparse or all-full streams. Keep min_qualifying_count at 4 and the qualifying window at 16 unless sparse contrasts remain near zero and E6/E13 are still short; dropping to 3 is a last resort because earlier sparse leakage was sensitive to it. Re-simulate and target E8/E9/E10/E11/E12 back near their iter-7 values, E15 around 0.03-0.06, E6 near -0.64 to -0.67, E13 near 0.80-0.84, and E16 near 0.64-0.68, while holding the already good E1-E5, E7, E8, and E14 matches approximately flat."
