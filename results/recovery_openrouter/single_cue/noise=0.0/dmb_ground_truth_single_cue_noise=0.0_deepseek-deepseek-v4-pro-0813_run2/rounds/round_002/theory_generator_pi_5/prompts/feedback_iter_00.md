# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Replace pi_3 with a conflict-gated reverse-lexicographic and tallying theory. The new theory should retain pi_4's backward lexicographic route and tallying route, but make route activation depend on the trial's cue structure instead of using one fixed mixture across all trials. Specifically: (1) detect extreme-cue conflict, defined as the highest-validity cue and the lowest-validity cue discriminating in opposite directions while the absolute tally difference abs(d) is small, roughly 0 or 1; (2) on such conflict trials use the backward lexicographic route with high probability, with subject-level reversal weight around 0.75 to 0.95 and a strong beta around 3 to 6 so the top-cue split approaches the observed -0.66 rather than -0.28; (3) on non-conflict trials use a mostly tallying route with only weak forward lexicographic weight, preserving the large tally advantage in Experiment 4, the low forward-TTB accuracy in Experiment 3, and the moderate negative second-cue effects in Experiments 5 and 6; (4) allow substantial between-subject variance in the reversal weight and beta to match the high observed variances around 0.049 to 0.060 in Experiments 1 and 2. This replaces pi_3's fixed q*TTB plus tally mixture with a backward route plus a conflict trigger, and differs from pi_4 by making strong backward scanning conditional on extreme-cue conflict rather than a constant moderate mixture weight.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People compare options with a conflict-gated dual-lexicographic/tallying system. A baseline mixture contains a weak forward Take-The-Best route, a moderate backward lexicographic route, and a feature-win tallying route. On each trial the absolute highest-validity and lowest-validity cues are inspected. If those two extreme cues discriminate in opposite directions, and the overall feature tally does not actively oppose the highest cue, the decision maker enters a conflict regime: tallying is suspended, and the choice is made with high probability by a strong backward lexicographic scan over ascending validities; otherwise the residual probability uses the weak forward lexicographic scan. When the highest-validity cue is tied, or the extreme cues do not form this particular conflict pattern, the habitual baseline mixture operates.

`rationale`:
The baseline mixture is kept close to the successful pi_4 configuration because it already accounts well for Experiments 1-4: Experiment 1's low forward-TTB accuracy, Experiment 2's tally advantage, and the moderate negative cue effects in Experiments 3 and 4. The new mechanism changes what happens when the absolute highest-validity cue and lowest-validity cue actively disagree and the tally does not overwhelmingly side against the top cue. On those conflict trials the model suppresses tallying and switches most of its probability to a strong backward lexicographic scan, leaving only a weak forward-lexicographic fallback. This produces the strongly negative top-cue effects observed in Experiments 5 and 6 without contaminating the non-conflict trials. The subject-level conflict weight and conflict beta are allowed to vary, which supplies the large between-subject variance reported for those experiments.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0158 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0158.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The point estimates are very strong. E1 forward-TTB accuracy is 0.2362 vs 0.2487 real, E4 gives -0.2675 vs -0.2742, E5 gives -0.6542 vs -0.6583, and E6 gives -0.6856 vs -0.6711. This shows the conflict-gated backward lexicographic route successfully fixes the wrong-signed top-cue effects seen in pi_3 while preserving the baseline tallying and weak forward-lexicographic behavior in E1-E4. The main failure is between-subject variance, especially where it matters most. E5 has simulated var 0.0062 vs real 0.0598, and E6 has simulated var 0.0052 vs real 0.0489, roughly a ten-fold underprediction. E1-E3 are also too homogeneous, with candidate vars of 0.0016, 0.0073, and 0.0074 against real vars of 0.0065, 0.0128, and 0.0159. The cause is clear: w_conflict_back is only [0.72,0.78] and beta_conflict_back is only [3.0,3.4], so every simulated subject produces nearly identical reverse-lexicographic choice probabilities. Real subjects evidently differ much more in how strongly they reverse on conflict trials. E2 is also slightly high at 0.4594 vs 0.4196, but that is secondary.",

  "rationale": "Keep the accepted conflict-gated dual-lexicographic/tallying architecture and keep the baseline mixture essentially intact, since E1-E4 point fits are good. Revise the subject-level conflict parameters to add real heterogeneity. Widen w_conflict_back well beyond [0.72,0.78], e.g. [0.45,0.95], or use a two-component distribution with mean near 0.74 and standard deviation near 0.15-0.20. Widen beta_conflict_back to approximately [1.5,8.0] or [2.0,8.0], preferably log-uniform, so some subjects are near-deterministic backward scanners while others are only moderately reversed. After widening, verify that the E5 point estimate stays near -0.65 and the E6 point stays near -0.67; if a broad uniform range shifts the mean too far, rebalance the center rather than narrowing the spread again. A modest widening of the baseline route-weight distributions may also be needed to lift E1-E3 variances. Do not switch mechanism families."
