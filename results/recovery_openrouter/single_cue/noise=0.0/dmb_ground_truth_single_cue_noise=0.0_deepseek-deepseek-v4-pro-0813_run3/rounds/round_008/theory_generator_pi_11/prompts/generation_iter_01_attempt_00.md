# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_9`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_10`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_9`).

Replace pi_9 with a boundary-parsing, equal-weight-segment theory. Keep the primary unweighted full tally for clear tallies. On ties or near-ties, segment the validity vector into contiguous coherent runs using validity discontinuities. Select, in order: (1) a terminal segment if one opens, including forced late-triplet openings on short displays; (2) otherwise the earliest coherent preceding segment; (3) otherwise remain at chance or use the low-confidence full tally. Critically, once a segment is selected, use only the unweighted signed sub-tally of that segment: all features inside the selected segment receive equal weight, with no recency ramp and no validity-ordered cue weighting. Validity differences affect only whether a segment is recognized and how decisively it drives the softmax/lapse, not the relative weights inside the segment. This should fix E1 by producing chance inside the non-flat forced late chunk, preserve pi_10's early-fallback successes in E2/E9/E18, and reduce the over-extreme late-weighted predictions in E15/E16/E17 while retaining the high-validity terminal-block effects in E5/E6.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.680)

**Description**
People make binary-feature choices by a primary unweighted signed tally. When the tally is clear, choice follows the tally stochastically with a small lapse. When the tally is tied or near-tied, people parse the validity display into a single contiguous terminal perceptual chunk only when the validity sequence contains a structural boundary. In addition to large jumps, moderate positive and negative end discontinuities, and cumulative short-display contrasts, short displays have a fallback parsing rule: if no other boundary rule has opened a chunk, the largest adjacent validity discontinuity defines the terminal chunk. A targeted forced late-pool rule is added for very short displays: when a flat high-validity early triplet is followed by a lower, homogeneous late triplet, that late block is opened with bounded decisiveness, producing recency-weighted choices against the early high-validity pool. Recency inside any chunk remains a weak linear ramp with a cap, not an exponential validity-times-position re-ranking, and large displays with small tallies remain low-confidence.

### `pi_10` (overall score: 0.623)

**Description**
People make binary-feature choices by a primary unweighted signed tally. When the tally is clear, choice follows the tally through a softmax with a small lapse. When the tally is tied or near-tied, people parse the advertised validity display into a single contiguous terminal chunk only when that chunk is coherent, i.e. its validity profile is flat and bounded by a clear validity discontinuity. Inside an opened terminal chunk the choice is based on an unweighted or validity-ordered sub-tally, never on positive exponential recency. When no coherent terminal chunk opens on a short display, people pool the earliest/largest coherent preceding block and choose by its sub-tally, producing directional anti-recency on late-block metrics. A targeted forced late-pool route is retained for very short displays in which an early homogeneous high-validity block is followed by a lower homogeneous late block.

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.414)

**Description**
People make binary-feature choices by a tally-first rule. When the unweighted signed tally is clearly nonzero, choice follows the tally through a softmax plus a small lapse. When the tally is tied or near-tied, advertised validities are used only to perceptually segment the cue display, and choice follows a recency-weighted sub-tally of a coherent late block if one is formed. Four segmentation routes can open such a block: (1) a large validity jump opening a later block of up to six cues; (2) a modest positive end boundary isolating a small two-to-three-cue late block; (3) a modest negative end drop isolating a homogeneous late low-validity block of two to three cues; and (4) a cumulative-contrast route, restricted to short displays of up to eight cues, that opens a homogeneous final two-to-three-cue block when its mean validity sits sufficiently below the immediately preceding two-to-three cues. For six-cue displays specifically, a homogeneous early elite followed by a uniformly lower late block is treated as a distinct late block even when the adjacent validity jump is moderate. When no perceptual block is formed, the tied choice is low confidence and is near chance.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.2387 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2387 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
People make binary-feature choices by a primary unweighted signed tally. When the full tally is clear, choice follows that tally through a stochastic choice rule. When the full tally is tied or near-tied, people parse the advertised validity vector into contiguous coherent runs and select one run to resolve the choice. Priority goes to a coherent terminal segment that is opened by a validity discontinuity, including forced late-triplet openings on short displays. If no terminal segment opens, people fall back to the earliest coherent preceding segment. Within the selected segment, all features receive equal weight: there is no recency ramp and no validity-ordered cue weighting. Validity differences affect only whether a segment is recognized and how decisively its sub-tally drives choice, not the relative weights inside the segment.

`rationale`: This theory keeps the unweighted full tally untouched for clear choices, which preserves the non-tie accuracy and calibration effects seen in the tall-display experiments. For ties it replaces pi_9's recency-weighted late-chunk machinery with a boundary-parsing rule that first finds coherent validity runs. A terminal segment drives choice only when a real boundary opens it or when a short-display forced late triplet is recognized; otherwise the earliest coherent preceding segment is used. Inside the chosen segment the signed sub-tally is unweighted, removing the recency ramp and validity-ordered cue weights that made pi_9 too extreme on late-weighted metrics. The non-flat forced case is damped through lower gain and higher lapse, which should pull E1 back toward the observed moderate anti-high-validity effect instead of pi_9's over-extreme negative value. Forcing the earliest-fallback route when no terminal segment opens preserves pi_10's early-fallback successes in experiments such as E2, E9, and E18.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the arbiter's prescribed architecture: unweighted full tally for clear choices, boundary-parsed contiguous validity runs for ties, terminal-segment priority with forced short-display openings, earliest-segment fallback, and equal weights inside the selected segment. It reproduces several target effects well (E9, E14, E15, E6, E8, E13 are close), and E2/E7 are in the right direction. However, the overall fit is not experiment-invariant. The most serious failures are sign reversals and large magnitude errors on conflict displays: E5 is observed at -0.047 but simulated at +0.767, E10 at -0.745 vs +0.143, E11 at +0.012 vs -0.463, and E18 at +0.725 vs +0.210. There is also an inverse miscalibration across high-validity terminal-block experiments: E3 is saturating at 3.00 vs observed 2.63 while E4 is far too weak at 1.86 vs observed 4.20. Short-display local/forced-segment predictions are too decisive: E16 is 0.481 vs 0.232 and E17 is 0.686 vs 0.505. A key implementation issue is that `tau_tie=0.5` with integer tallies reduces 'near-tie' to exact tie only, so many near-balanced early/late conflict displays never reach the boundary parser and instead follow the full tally, producing the wrong signs in E10/E11/E18/E12.
Rationale: Keep the prescribed boundary-parsing, equal-weight-segment mechanism but recalibrate its trigger and decisiveness rules. First, widen the near-tie trigger: replace the exact-tie-only `tau_tie=0.5` with a genuine near-tie band (e.g., |tally| <= 2 or 3) so block-conflict displays enter segment parsing rather than full-tally responding; this is the most likely fix for the E10/E11/E18 sign/magnitude failures. Second, make terminal-segment decisiveness length and altitude sensitive: add a much stronger size penalty for long high-altitude terminal runs (E5 and E3 are currently too deterministic and too extreme), while raising gain or lowering lapse for small-to-moderate terminal runs that humans use very decisively (E4 is too weak). Third, damp the forced/nonflat short-display route when the selected late segment is nonflat or weakly contrasted (E16/E17 are overpredicted and E1 is still too negative), but do not damp the cases where the forced late route needs to drive strongly against the early block (E10). Finally, keep and strengthen the earliest-fallback route where no clean terminal discontinuity opens, since E18 and E12 are currently too weak relative to the real late/anti-early effects. All of these are in-family calibration adjustments to segment recognition, gain, lapse, and the near-tie gate; no mechanism-family switch is needed.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2387 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

## Response

{
  "theory": "People make binary-feature choices by a primary unweighted signed tally. When the full tally is clearly non-zero (|tally| > 2), choice follows that tally through a stochastic choice rule. When the tally is tied or near-tied (|tally| <= 2), people parse the advertised validity vector into contiguous coherent runs and select one run to resolve the choice. Priority goes to coherent terminal segments opened by validity discontinuities, but recognition is length- and altitude-sensitive: very long high-validity terminal runs are heavily damped, and low-validity terminal runs longer than three features are not treated as terminal boundaries. If no usable terminal segment opens, people fall back to the earliest coherent preceding segment. Inside the selected segment, all features receive equal weight: validity differences affect only whether a segment is recognized and how decisively its sub-tally drives choice, never the relative cue weights within the segment.",

  "rationale": "This is a minimal calibration edit of the previous boundary-parsing, equal-weight-segment candidate. The near-tie gate is widened from exact tie to |tally| <= 2 so block-conflict displays with small nonzero tallies enter segment parsing instead of following the full tally; this targets the sign errors in E10, E11, and E18. Long high-validity terminal runs now receive a much stronger size-dependent penalty and a large extra lapse only for runs of length seven or more, which dampens the over-extreme late-terminal behavior in E5 without forcing E3's six-cue high-validity terminal block to chance. Long low-validity terminal runs longer than three cues are no longer recognized as terminal boundaries, allowing the earliest coherent preceding segment to drive E18/E12-type choices; the fallback route is also sharpened with lower lapse and higher beta. Moderate terminal segments are made more decisive, which should correct the too-weak E4 effect. Non-flat forced short-display segments are damped more strongly, reducing the over-predictions in E1, E16, and E17 while preserving the flat forced late route needed for E10."
