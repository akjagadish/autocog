# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
People use a validity-graded compensatory integration rule. On every choice they inspect all features, compute a signed option advantage by summing each discriminating feature's contribution, and then choose via a softmax over that advantage plus an independent lapse. Unlike Take The Best there is no early stopping. Unlike pure Tallying, each feature's contribution is weighted by a validity-sensitive multiplier. The multiplier is anchored around equal weighting, w_j = 1 + kappa * (v_j - mean(v)), normalized so the average weight is exactly 1. Because kappa has a symmetric prior centered at zero, the population-level expected weight vector is the equal-weight vector, but individual subjects may slightly overweight or underweight higher-validity cues. Tied features contribute nothing.

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Tally-first choice with a salience-gated and size-regularized validity tie-break. On every trial the unweighted signed tally of the feature differences is the default choice signal. When the tally is clear, choice follows it through a moderate softmax plus an explicit lapse. When the tally is tied or near-tied, validity is allowed to matter only if the task's validity distribution itself advertises a clear elite: either a small elite block of two to three maximally valid cues separated from the remaining cues, or a large validity gap combined with a bounded elite-block size. In those gated cases people compute a restricted sub-tally over the elite cues and choose its favored option stochastically. Larger elite blocks receive an additional lapse, preventing overconfident validity-following for wide top tiers. In large stimulus arrays, near-zero tallies are treated as low-confidence and are heavily regularized with extra choice noise, so deterministic regression blows-up do not occur.

**Rationale:** This design isolates the competing theory's large-array near-tally regularization from the advocated validity-graded integration. The validity set has 20 experts: nine at 1.00, nine at 0.50, and two at 0.75. The mean validity is 0.75, so centered validities are +0.25 for the 1.00 experts, -0.25 for the 0.50 experts, and 0 for the 0.75 experts. The top tier contains nine experts with validity 1.00, the next validity is 0.75, and the gap is 0.25. That gap is below the competing theory's minimum salience_gap_hi of 0.30, and the top block is size 9 rather than a small elite of 2-3, so the validity tie-break never becomes active. All 16 unique pairs have unweighted tally d = sum(a_i - b_i) equal to +1 or -1, never zero, so there is no exact-tie validity fallback either. Because n_features = 20, the competing theory places every pair in the low-confidence near-tally branch. With beta_near between 0.3 and 0.8 and epsilon_near between 0.78 and 0.97, p(A) for d = +1 is only about 0.51 to 0.57, and p(A) for d = -1 is about 0.43 to 0.49, with no S effect across pairs. The advocated theory predicts D = d + kappa*S, where S = sum((v_i - 0.75)*(a_i - b_i)). The first eight pairs have d = +1 and S values -4.5, -3.0, -1.5, -0.5, +0.5, +1.5, +3.0, +4.5; the last eight are A/B swaps with d = -1 and opposite S values. For kappa in [-0.10, 0.10], D remains positive on all d = +1 pairs and negative on all d = -1 pairs. With a moderate beta, advocated choice probabilities are therefore far from chance, and within each d block they vary with S in opposite directions for positive versus negative kappa subjects. The competing theory instead predicts near-chance choices in both blocks with a nearly flat S curve. The mirrored pairs control for A/B response bias, and 16 unique pairs x 6 repeats gives 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric is a model-free tally-direction choice-sensitivity index: the mean response (0 = A, 1 = B) when the unweighted feature tally favors B minus the mean response when it favors A. The mirrored pairs make it insensitive to overall A/B response bias. Under the advocated validity-graded integration, the signed advantage is D = d + kappa*S; with kappa in [-0.10, 0.10] and S in [-4.5, 4.5], the sign of D always matches the tally d, so after softmax and lapse the response probabilities are strongly shifted toward the tally-favored option, giving an index near 0.70 to 0.80. Under the competing theory, every test pair enters the low-confidence near-tally branch (n = 20 and abs(d) = 1), the salience gate is off (top size 9, validity gap 0.25), and epsilon_near of 0.78 to 0.97 adds almost complete lapse, so response probabilities stay near chance and the index remains near 0.05 to 0.10. The metric is computed per subject and on the pooled data, and it uses only observed choices and design-constant tallies.

**Rationale:** This experiment uses six experts with validities [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.9, 0.5]. The mean validity is 0.8833, so the centered validities are [0.1167, 0.1167, 0.1167, 0.0167, 0.0167, -0.3833]. The top tier is exactly the three 1.0 experts; the second highest validity is 0.9, giving a validity gap of 0.10 and a top size of 3, which opens the advocated theory's small-elite tie-break gate.

Every unique pair is a tally tie: d = sum(A - B) = 0. On these pairs the advocated theory's default tallying signal is silent, and its gated tie-break consults only the three top experts. Let T be the top sub-tally, the number of top experts favoring A minus the number favoring B, and let S be the centered-validity score, S = sum c*(A - B). The construction uses the two 0.9 experts and the one 0.5 expert to vary S independently of T; in this validity set S = 0.5*T + 0.4*U, where U is the difference sum of the two 0.9 experts.

Trials 1-6 have T = +1, +1, +1, +2, +2, +3 with S values -0.30, 0.10, 0.50, 0.20, 0.60, 0.70. Trials 7-12 are the exact A/B mirrors with T = -1, -1, -1, -2, -2, -3 and S values 0.30, -0.10, -0.50, -0.20, -0.60, -0.70.

The advocated theory predicts p(A) follows T only: the three T=+1 pairs are indistinguishable around 0.57-0.61, the two T=+2 pairs around 0.645-0.71, and the T=+3 pair around 0.71-0.79, with mirrored values below 0.5. In particular, within T=+1, the large S change from -0.30 to +0.50 should not move p(A).

The competing validity-graded integrator has d = 0 on every trial, so its only advantage term is kappa*S. Because kappa has a symmetric zero-centered prior, the expected p(A) is exactly 0.5 for every one of the 12 pairs, regardless of T. Positive-kappa subjects would order the choices by S, with P1 below 0.5 and P3 above 0.5, while negative-kappa subjects would reverse that order. Thus the design gives a quantitative dissociation: a T-ordered elite sub-tally psychometric function for the advocated theory versus a flat-at-chance S-only pattern for the competing theory. The 12 unique pairs are repeated K = 8 times to give 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
For the three elite validity-1.0 experts, define the top sub-tally T = (a0 + a1 + a2) - (b0 + b1 + b2). The metric is mean chose_A on rows with T = +3 minus mean chose_A on rows with T = -3, where chose_A = 1 - response. The advocated theory predicts that the gated tie-break makes A much more likely when all three elite experts favor A, and much less likely when all three favor B, so this signed difference is large and positive. For the competing validity-graded integrator these two rows have centered-validity scores S = +0.7 and S = -0.7; with a symmetric zero-centered kappa prior, expected p(A) is 0.5 for both rows, so the signed contrast averages to zero. The same contrast is computed on pooled and per-subject slices, keeping its scale stable.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the ten experiments pi_6 is clearly the better task-invariant account, while pi_3 is not viable. pi_3 fails catastrophically in the large-array/low-tally cases: Experiment 1 observed 0.030 but pi_3 predicts 0.703; Experiment 10 observed 0.928 but pi_3 predicts 84359.60; Experiment 6 observed 4.202 but pi_3 predicts 1.172. Its symmetric zero-centered kappa also makes it predict chance on exact-tally trials, contradicted by Experiments 5 and 6. pi_3 only wins on several moderate comparisons such as Experiments 3, 4, and 9. pi_6 captures the near-chance behavior in Experiment 1, avoids the Experiment 10 blow-up, matches Experiment 6 almost exactly, and handles the gated no-effect cases in Experiments 7 and 8. The serious exception is Experiment 2, where the observed contrast is -0.745 while pi_6 predicts +0.750: the sign is reversed. In that design the three highest-validity cues occupy display positions 0-2 while the opposing three cues occupy later positions 3-5; in Experiment 6, where pi_6 succeeds, the highest-validity cues occupy later positions 7-9. This points to a serial-position or recency component in the tie-break rather than pure advertised-validity following. Thus forwarding pi_6 unchanged is not enough; the correct move is to replace the degenerate always-on validity-graded integration theory pi_3 with a new theory that keeps pi_6's confidence gating but adds position/recency weighting to fix the Experiment 2 sign.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_3 with a new theory: confidence-gated unweighted tally with a position/recency-weighted validity tie-break. The default signal should remain the signed tally; when n_features is large and abs(tally) is small or the tally is exactly zero, inject strong near-chance lapse or noise with epsilon in about 0.80-0.97, as pi_6 does, to reproduce Experiments 1, 7, 8, and 10. When a tie or near-tie occurs and the cue configuration advertises a small coherent block, engage a restricted sub-tally, but compute the block weights from a mixture of advertised validity and serial display position. Let the position component be non-negative recency weighting, for example an effective cue weight proportional to validity times exp(rho * position_index), with rho bounded between 0 and 1. This makes late relevant cues dominate over early cues. In Experiment 2 the three advertised-validity-1.0 cues are early and the opposite three cues are late, so the late block wins and the predicted contrast becomes negative, matching -0.745. In Experiment 6 the highest-validity cues are late, so the observed positive contrast is preserved. Keep the small-block and validity-gap gates with block size around 2-4 and clear separation or a large gap so that Experiments 7 and 8 show little validity use. Use bounded logits, probability clipping, and a capped or regularized per-subject variance estimate; this avoids the Experiment 10 blow-up seen in pi_3. Parameter ranges should include epsilon high for low confidence from 0.80 to 0.97, beta from 0.3 to 1.0, top block size 2-4, gap thresholds 0.05-0.30, recency strength rho 0.0-1.0, and all variance contributions regularized with a floor."
