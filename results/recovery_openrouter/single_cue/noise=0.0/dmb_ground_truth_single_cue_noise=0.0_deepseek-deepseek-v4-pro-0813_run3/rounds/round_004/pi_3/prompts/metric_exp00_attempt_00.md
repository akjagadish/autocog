# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** This design isolates the competing theory's large-array near-tally regularization from the advocated validity-graded integration. The validity set has 20 experts: nine at 1.00, nine at 0.50, and two at 0.75. The mean validity is 0.75, so centered validities are +0.25 for the 1.00 experts, -0.25 for the 0.50 experts, and 0 for the 0.75 experts. The top tier contains nine experts with validity 1.00, the next validity is 0.75, and the gap is 0.25. That gap is below the competing theory's minimum salience_gap_hi of 0.30, and the top block is size 9 rather than a small elite of 2-3, so the validity tie-break never becomes active. All 16 unique pairs have unweighted tally d = sum(a_i - b_i) equal to +1 or -1, never zero, so there is no exact-tie validity fallback either. Because n_features = 20, the competing theory places every pair in the low-confidence near-tally branch. With beta_near between 0.3 and 0.8 and epsilon_near between 0.78 and 0.97, p(A) for d = +1 is only about 0.51 to 0.57, and p(A) for d = -1 is about 0.43 to 0.49, with no S effect across pairs. The advocated theory predicts D = d + kappa*S, where S = sum((v_i - 0.75)*(a_i - b_i)). The first eight pairs have d = +1 and S values -4.5, -3.0, -1.5, -0.5, +0.5, +1.5, +3.0, +4.5; the last eight are A/B swaps with d = -1 and opposite S values. For kappa in [-0.10, 0.10], D remains positive on all d = +1 pairs and negative on all d = -1 pairs. With a moderate beta, advocated choice probabilities are therefore far from chance, and within each d block they vary with S in opposite directions for positive versus negative kappa subjects. The competing theory instead predicts near-chance choices in both blocks with a nearly flat S curve. The mirrored pairs control for A/B response bias, and 16 unique pairs x 6 repeats gives 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People use a validity-graded compensatory integration rule. On every choice they inspect all features, compute a signed option advantage by summing each discriminating feature's contribution, and then choose via a softmax over that advantage plus an independent lapse. Unlike Take The Best there is no early stopping. Unlike pure Tallying, each feature's contribution is weighted by a validity-sensitive multiplier. The multiplier is anchored around equal weighting, w_j = 1 + kappa * (v_j - mean(v)), normalized so the average weight is exactly 1. Because kappa has a symmetric prior centered at zero, the population-level expected weight vector is the equal-weight vector, but individual subjects may slightly overweight or underweight higher-validity cues. Tied features contribute nothing.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- kappa: [-0.10, 0.10]
- validities: validities

    # no trial-by-trial feedback and the rule is applied independently each trial.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Tally-first choice with a salience-gated and size-regularized validity tie-break. On every trial the unweighted signed tally of the feature differences is the default choice signal. When the tally is clear, choice follows it through a moderate softmax plus an explicit lapse. When the tally is tied or near-tied, validity is allowed to matter only if the task's validity distribution itself advertises a clear elite: either a small elite block of two to three maximally valid cues separated from the remaining cues, or a large validity gap combined with a bounded elite-block size. In those gated cases people compute a restricted sub-tally over the elite cues and choose its favored option stochastically. Larger elite blocks receive an additional lapse, preventing overconfident validity-following for wide top tiers. In large stimulus arrays, near-zero tallies are treated as low-confidence and are heavily regularized with extra choice noise, so deterministic regression blows-up do not occur.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

Under the competing theory, every test pair enters the low-confidence near-tally branch (n = 20 and abs(d) = 1), the salience gate is off (top size 9, validity gap 0.25), and epsilon_near of 0.78 to 0.97 adds almost complete lapse, so response probabilities stay near chance and the index remains near 0.05 to 0.10. The metric is computed per subject and on the pooled data, and it uses only observed choices and design-constant tallies."
