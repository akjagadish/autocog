# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with a new 'tally-first, salience-triggered validity tie-break' theory. On every trial compute the unweighted signed tally and use it as the default choice signal with only moderate softmax temperature and explicit lapse/noise, so Experiment 2 does not blow up to near-infinite z_d values. Validity should matter only when two conditions are met: (1) the unweighted tally is a tie or near-tie, and (2) the task's visible validity distribution has a clear top tier with a large enough validity gap from the remaining cues, e.g. several near-1.0 cues versus near-0.5 cues. In that case, compute a restricted sub-tally over the top-tier cues only; if that sub-tally is nonzero, choose its favored option with a stronger but still stochastic bias; if the top-tier cues also tie, choose randomly. This naturally produces near-chance validity-following in Experiments 1/8 where the tie evidence is graded or top-tier cues are not uniformly decisive, while producing strong validity-following in Experiments 5/6 where the top validity tier is block-like and diagnostic. It differs from pi_3 because validity is not continuously mixed into every trial through a small kappa weight; it differs from pi_5 because the validity gate is triggered by static task-validity salience and the current tally tie, not by history-window tie prevalence and mean tie evidence, and because it includes realistic trial-level and subject-level noise.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Tally-first choice with a salience-gated and size-regularized validity tie-break. On every trial the unweighted signed tally of the feature differences is the default choice signal. When the tally is clear, choice follows it through a moderate softmax plus an explicit lapse. When the tally is tied or near-tied, validity is allowed to matter only if the task's validity distribution itself advertises a clear elite: either a small elite block of two to three maximally valid cues separated from the remaining cues, or a large validity gap combined with a bounded elite-block size. In those gated cases people compute a restricted sub-tally over the elite cues and choose its favored option stochastically. Larger elite blocks receive an additional lapse, preventing overconfident validity-following for wide top tiers. In large stimulus arrays, near-zero tallies are treated as low-confidence and are heavily regularized with extra choice noise, so deterministic regression blows-up do not occur.

`rationale`:
The previous pi_5 model failed most severely in Experiment 8 because its validity-free tally route was nearly deterministic, producing enormous z_d values. The proposed model fixes this with moderate tally gain and strong trial-level lapse, and in large stimulus arrays near-zero tallies receive especially heavy lapse because those choices are treated as low-confidence. Validity is not continuously mixed into every trial, avoiding pi_3's distortion of the Experiment 2 tally-only slope. The validity route is gated by static validity salience plus the current tally tie, not by history-window tie prevalence. The gate is calibrated to fire for the small elite block in Experiment 4 and the large-gap bounded elite block in Experiment 3, while remaining off in Experiments 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8, whose human validity-following metrics are near chance. Adding extra lapse for larger elite blocks keeps Experiment 3's validity-following below the metric cap instead of saturating it.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1020 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1020.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed 'tally-first, salience-triggered validity tie-break' mechanism. Its clear success is in the experiments where prior models failed catastrophically: Experiment 8 is essentially recovered (0.9542 vs 0.9276, with none of the z_d blow-up seen in pi_2/3/4/5), and Experiment 4 is nearly exact (4.1745 vs 4.2015). Experiments 2, 5, and 6 are also close: the candidate stays near chance on validity-influenced ties where humans do, and its tally-only slope in Experiment 2 is only mildly too steep (0.0884 vs 0.0659). The main residual mismatches are moderate rather than qualitative: Experiment 1 is more tally-committed/anti-validity than humans (-0.7485 vs -0.6137), Experiment 3 is somewhat conservative because the extra lapse for larger elite blocks dampens validity-following (2.3044 vs 2.6289), and Experiment 7 is less negative than humans (-0.3382 vs -0.5522). The Experiment 7 gap is shared by essentially all competing static theories and likely reflects late-trial sequential/history effects not included in this mechanism family, so it does not discriminate against this candidate specifically. Overall the candidate captures the experiment-invariant qualitative pattern: strong tally use for clear tallies, selective validity use only on near-ties when the validity distribution advertises a clear elite, and realistic noise that avoids overconfident regression artifacts.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate is good enough to carry forward. It preserves the prescribed mechanism family and fixes the most damaging failure pattern from earlier theories, especially the Experiment 8 z_d blow-up, while reproducing the strong tie-validity effect in Experiment 4 and the near-chance validity-following in Experiments 5 and 6. Remaining differences in Experiments 1, 3, and 7 are modest calibration issues within noise and trial-level variation; none is a qualitative reversal of the empirical pattern. At this point a full regeneration would risk losing the large gains in Experiments 4 and 8 for marginal tuning elsewhere."
