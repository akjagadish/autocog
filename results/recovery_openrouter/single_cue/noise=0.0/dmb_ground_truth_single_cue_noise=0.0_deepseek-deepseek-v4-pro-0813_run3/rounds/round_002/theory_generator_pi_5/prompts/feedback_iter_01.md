# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a new theory that replaces the fixed validity-gated tallying of pi_4: people adaptively decide whether unweighted tallying is diagnostic in the current task, and use validity to resolve ties only when tally ties are frequent. In the new theory, on each trial compute the unweighted tally difference d = #A wins - #B wins and a validity-weighted evidence V = sum_j w_j * (A_j - B_j). From the recent or global stimulus history, compute a context statistic c such as the proportion of trials with |d| <= tau or the average absolute tally. The choice probability should be a mixture p = lambda(c) * p_valid + (1 - lambda(c)) * p_tally, with lambda increasing when tie prevalence is high. For low tie prevalence, lambda should be small, recovering near-zero tie-validity alignment as in Experiments 1 and 2. For high tie prevalence, lambda should be large, producing strong validity-aligned choices as in Experiments 5 and 6, but with enough trial or subject stochasticity to avoid pi_4's overly small variance. This new theory differs from pi_3 because it has a task-composition-dependent validity route rather than continuous zero-centered validity grading on every trial, and differs from pi_4 because the validity gate is not fixed but is switched by context. The next model should use the history argument that the current theories ignore, and parameter ranges should allow both weak and strong validity reliance, with moderate between-subject variability.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People adaptively decide whether unweighted tallying is diagnostic in the current task. They track the prevalence of exact tally ties in the stimulus history, and use that context to gate a validity-based fallback. When ties are rare, choice is essentially pure unweighted tallying. When exact ties are pervasive, validity information is recruited to break ties, yielding a context-weighted mixture of a tally policy and a validity policy. The present revision recalibrates the context gate so that moderately high tie prevalence, as in Experiments 3 and 4, recruits validity strongly and consistently, while near-chance tie prevalence in Experiments 1, 2, 5, and 6 leaves tallying dominant.

`rationale`:
The previous candidate kept the correct adaptive context-mixture architecture but under-recruited validity in the high tie-prevalence tasks because its gate threshold was too high and the normalized gain divided by 1 - c0 was extremely attenuating, especially with ctx_power in [1,4]. This edit follows the critic's diagnosis without switching mechanisms: c0 is lowered and narrowed into a band above the near-0.5 tie prevalence in Experiments 1, 2, 5, and 6 but below the roughly 0.58-0.83 tie prevalence in Experiments 3 and 4. The normalized denominator is replaced by a small gate_width so the gate rises sharply above threshold instead of being crushed, while ctx_power is moved below 1 so the response becomes stronger rather than weaker. lambda_max is raised close to 1, and lambda_min is lowered near 0 so low tie-prevalence conditions stay close to pure tallying. The history window is enlarged to use essentially the full run, which reduces noisy context estimates and should lower the inflated between-subject variance seen previously in Experiment 3.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3038 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1113 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1113.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed adaptive context-gated mixture architecture, and it performs well in the low tie-prevalence conditions. Experiment 1 is close (-0.562 vs -0.614 real), Experiment 2 is nearly exact (0.0664 vs 0.0659 real), and Experiments 5 and 6 correctly stay near zero validity alignment (0.023 vs -0.047 and 0.047 vs 0.020). The failure is concentrated in the high tie-prevalence tasks. Experiment 3 real tie-validity alignment is 2.629 but the candidate gives 1.098, and Experiment 4 real is 4.202 while the candidate gives only 0.193. In both cases the model systematically under-recruits the validity route on tied tallies. The likely cause is gate calibration: c0 is set between 0.60 and 0.80, while the high-tie designs have tie prevalence around 0.63 to 0.67, so many simulated subjects sit near or below the gate threshold. Even subjects above threshold get only a tiny normalized gain g = (c - c0) / (1 - c0), and the current ctx_power range 1.0 to 4.0 further shrinks that already small value. With lambda close to zero, choices on exact ties remain near the 0.5 tally policy, producing weak tie-validity alignment. The between-subject variance in Experiment 3 is also too large (0.693 vs 0.285 real), consistent with some subjects turning the gate on and others leaving it off.
Rationale: Keep the adaptive context mixture and the history-based tie prevalence statistic, but recalibrate the gate so moderate-to-high tie prevalence actually recruits validity strongly. Concretely, lower c0 to sit above the low-tie tasks and below the high-tie tasks, for example c0 in [0.50, 0.58] rather than [0.60, 0.80], and make the gate respond more sharply or less attenuatingly above threshold. Options include replacing ctx_power [1.0, 4.0] with an exponent below 1.0, such as [0.3, 0.8], or introducing a steep logistic gate centered around roughly 0.58 to 0.62 with a moderate gain. This should let tie prevalence near 0.65 produce lambda close to lambda_max while keeping tie prevalence near 0.5 or below guarded. It may also help to sample c0 over a narrower range or increase lambda_max toward 1.0 so that once the validity route is recruited it is recruited consistently, reducing the inflated subject variance in Experiment 3. Do not switch mechanism families; the history-gated mixture is appropriate and only its context threshold and gain need adjustment.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3038 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1113 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is a clear aggregate improvement, dropping loss from 0.3038 to 0.1113 and matching Experiment 2 almost exactly. Experiment 5 is also close. The adaptive mixture is now recruiting validity strongly in the high-tie Experiments 3 and 4, but it has overshot: Experiment 3 gives 2.9956 versus 2.6289 real, with subject variance 0.0010 versus 0.2854, and Experiment 4 gives 4.7317 versus 4.2015. More importantly, Experiment 6 is badly over-aligned: 0.1942 versus 0.0204 real. The key diagnosis is that Experiments 3 and 6 have the same exact-tie prevalence, about 0.75, yet real humans show strong validity alignment in Experiment 3 and essentially chance alignment in Experiment 6. Because the current gate uses only tie prevalence, it cannot separate these two tasks and switches validity on for both. The current validity route is also too deterministic once gated on because lambda_max is near 1 and beta_v is high. Experiment 1 is also somewhat too high at -0.4937 versus -0.6137, suggesting that when the tally route dominates, the model is not tally-deterministic enough or is leaking a little validity influence.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the prescribed adaptive context-gated mixture, but revise the context statistic so it reflects whether validity is actually diagnostic in the task, not just whether tallies tie. A practical variant is to compute the mean signed validity-weighted evidence V across past tie trials, or to combine tie prevalence with a function of mean absolute V, or to require both the tie-prevalence threshold and a diagnostic-consistency threshold. In Experiment 6 the high-validity features alternate sides across tie trials, so mean V is near zero and the gate should remain low; in Experiments 3 and 4 the validity advantage is consistent across tie trials, so the gate should rise. This stays inside the prescribed adaptive validity-gate family and only changes the context summary. Also moderate the now excessive validity strength and determinism: move lambda_max down from [0.95, 1.0] to roughly [0.80, 0.90], lower beta_v to something like [5, 15] or [5, 20], and allow a small epsilon_v in the range 0.03 to 0.10. This should bring Experiments 3 and 4 near their real means and restore the moderate between-subject variance that Experiment 3 requires. To repair Experiment 1, make the low-tie tally route more decisive by raising the lower bound of beta_tally and restricting epsilon_tally, for example beta_tally in [5, 20] and epsilon_tally in [0.0, 0.1]. Do not switch mechanism families; this is a calibration and context-statistic revision of the accepted candidate."
