# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Propose a Weighted Additive Model (WADD) as the new theory. Unlike TTB (which is non-compensatory and only uses the top discriminating cue) and Tallying (which is compensatory but unweighted), WADD computes a fully compensatory, weighted sum of the features using the provided cue validities as weights. The probability of choosing an option should be a softmax over these weighted sums. This will serve as a rigorous rational baseline to see if subjects are incorporating validities into a compensatory decision process.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People make decisions between options by computing a fully compensatory, weighted sum of each option's features, using the provided cue validities as weights (Weighted Additive Model, WADD). Rather than relying on a single discriminating cue (like Take The Best) or ignoring validities entirely (like Tallying), decision-makers integrate all available evidence proportionally to its reliability. Response selection is probabilistic, modeled as a softmax over the weighted sums with an inverse temperature parameter and an independent lapse rate. The inverse temperature parameter is constrained to very low values to reflect the high degree of stochasticity observed in human choices.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != stim.shape[1]:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {stim.shape[1]}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(val * a)
    score_b = np.sum(val * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.01, 2.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, the upper bound of the inverse temperature parameter `beta` has been further lowered from 5.0 to 2.0. This minimal edit restricts the model from becoming too deterministic, enforcing the softer, more probabilistic choices necessary to fully close the gap with the empirical data where choice proportions sit closer to 0.5. The core WADD mechanism remains unchanged.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4082 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1730 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1028 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.1028.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory implements the prescribed Weighted Additive Model (WADD). While it performs better than the deterministic TTB baseline (pi_1), it currently overshoots in the direction of the winning options. For Experiment 1, the observed choice proportion is 0.40, but the candidate predicts 0.17. For Experiment 2, the observed proportion is 0.50, but the candidate predicts 0.68. Both observed values are near 0.5, suggesting that human subjects exhibit more stochasticity or less sensitivity to the weighted sum differences than the current parameter ranges allow.
Rationale: The implementation of the WADD mechanism is correct and faithful to the arbiter's recommendation. However, the parameter ranges allow the model to become too deterministic, causing it to overshoot the observed choice proportions which are much closer to 0.5. Lower the upper bound of the inverse temperature parameter `beta` (e.g., to [0.01, 5.0]) to enforce softer, more probabilistic choices that better align with the empirical data.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4082 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1730 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate's implementation of the Weighted Additive Model (WADD) successfully moved the predictions closer to the empirical data by lowering the inverse temperature (beta) range. In Experiment 1, the prediction moved from 0.1733 to 0.2867, approaching the true value of 0.4000. In Experiment 2, the prediction moved from 0.6850 to 0.5700, approaching the true value of 0.5000. However, there is still room for improvement, as the model remains slightly too deterministic compared to the highly stochastic human behavior observed in these experiments.
Rationale: The previous advice to lower the upper bound of `beta` was highly successful and accepted by the gate. To fully close the gap with the empirical data (which sits at 0.40 and 0.50), the model needs to be slightly more stochastic. Further reduce the upper bound of `beta` (e.g., to 1.5 or 2.0) to allow the model to better capture the near-random choice proportions observed in the experiments.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1730 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1028 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.
