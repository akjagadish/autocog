# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People make decisions between options by computing a fully compensatory, weighted sum of each option's features, using the provided cue validities as weights (Weighted Additive Model, WADD). Rather than relying on a single discriminating cue (like Take The Best) or ignoring validities entirely (like Tallying), decision-makers integrate all available evidence proportionally to its reliability. Response selection is probabilistic, modeled as a softmax over the weighted sums with an inverse temperature parameter and an independent lapse rate. The inverse temperature parameter is constrained to very low values to reflect the high degree of stochasticity observed in human choices.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the upper bound of the inverse temperature parameter `beta` has been further lowered from 5.0 to 2.0. This minimal edit restricts the model from becoming too deterministic, enforcing the softer, more probabilistic choices necessary to fully close the gap with the empirical data where choice proportions sit closer to 0.5. The core WADD mechanism remains unchanged.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.01, 2.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != stim.shape[1]:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {stim.shape[1]}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(val * a)
    score_b = np.sum(val * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Noisy Take-The-Best: Decision-makers evaluate options lexicographically, starting with the most valid cue and stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the options. However, the execution of this heuristic is highly stochastic, characterized by a massive lapse rate. Because the observed aggregate behavior is very close to random guessing (~0.50), the theory posits that subjects frequently suffer from attentional lapses or guess uniformly, effectively washing out the deterministic TTB predictions with heavy noise.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, this model instantiates a 'Noisy Take-The-Best' (Lexicographic) theory. It uses the standard TTB stopping rule (checking cues in descending validity order until one discriminates) but incorporates massive response noise to capture the ~0.50 empirical metrics across experiments. By constraining the lapse rate `epsilon` to a very high range [0.7, 1.0], the model acknowledges the heavy stochasticity in human data, providing a non-compensatory heuristic alternative to WADD while correcting the deterministic failure of the previous TTB model.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.7, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    # Sort cues by descending validity
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break
            
    if winner is None:
        p_core = np.ones(2) / 2.0
    else:
        scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])
        beta = float(parameters["beta"])
        z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
        e = np.exp(z)
        p_core = e / e.sum()
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(2) / 2.0)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
