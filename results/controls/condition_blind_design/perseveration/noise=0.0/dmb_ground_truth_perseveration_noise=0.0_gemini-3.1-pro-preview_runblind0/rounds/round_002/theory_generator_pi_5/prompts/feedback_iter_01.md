# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Propose a 'Noisy Tallying' (Equal Weights) theory. The theory should posit that subjects ignore the specific cue validities provided in the instructions, as integrating them is too cognitively demanding. Instead, they simply count the number of positive features (1s) for each option and choose the one with the higher total. To account for the observed metrics being very close to 0.5 across all experiments, the model must include a very high lapse rate (epsilon parameter centered around 0.8 to 0.95), reflecting that subjects frequently guess randomly.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Noisy Equal Weights (Tallying): Decision-makers find integrating specific cue validities too cognitively demanding. Instead, they evaluate options by simply counting the number of positive features (1s) for each option, treating all cues equally, and preferring the option with the higher total. However, their choices are dominated by an extremely high lapse rate (epsilon ~0.90-1.0), meaning they almost always guess randomly. This accounts for the observed aggregate behavior being essentially at chance across multiple experimental metrics.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Count the number of positive features (1s) for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a)
    score_b = np.sum(b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.9, 1.0]

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, the Noisy Tallying mechanism is kept exactly the same, but the epsilon parameter range is shifted higher to [0.90, 1.0]. This minimal edit further washes out the deterministic tallying predictions, bringing the simulated metrics closer to the near-perfectly random behavior (0.50 choice proportion / 0.0 score difference) observed in the human data across experiments.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1211 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0227 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0227.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate implements the Noisy Tallying (Equal Weights) theory with a high lapse rate as prescribed, and the loop accepted it with a strong loss improvement (loss=0.1211). The model successfully captures the near-random baseline behavior across most experiments. However, there is still a slight residual signal from the tallying heuristic that causes the model to overshoot in experiments where human behavior is almost perfectly random. For instance, in Experiment 4 the observed value is 0.5000 while the candidate predicts 0.6000; in Experiment 5 the observed value is -0.0231 while the candidate predicts 0.1231; and in Experiment 6 the observed value is 0.5200 while the candidate predicts 0.5933.
Rationale: The current model is on the right track and was accepted, but the tallying signal is still slightly too strong compared to the nearly perfectly random human data. Keep the exact same Noisy Tallying mechanism and equation, but shift the `epsilon` parameter range even higher to [0.90, 1.0] (instead of 0.8 to 0.95) to further wash out the deterministic predictions and bring the simulated metrics closer to 0.5 / 0.0.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1211 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0227 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate implements Noisy Tallying with a very high epsilon range [0.9, 1.0], acting on the previous advice. This adjustment has been remarkably successful, reducing the loss to 0.0227. The predicted metrics now closely match the human data across all experiments: Experiment 1 (0.4200 vs 0.4000), Experiment 2 (0.4900 vs 0.5000), Experiment 3 (0.5167 vs 0.5046), Experiment 4 (0.5017 vs 0.5000), Experiment 5 (0.0062 vs -0.0231), and Experiment 6 (0.5167 vs 0.5200). The model successfully washes out the deterministic tallying predictions just enough to capture the near-random empirical behavior.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The current theory and model parameters provide an excellent fit to the empirical data across all tested experiments. The shift to a higher epsilon range [0.9, 1.0] accurately captured the high degree of randomness in human choices in this paradigm. No further modifications are needed."
