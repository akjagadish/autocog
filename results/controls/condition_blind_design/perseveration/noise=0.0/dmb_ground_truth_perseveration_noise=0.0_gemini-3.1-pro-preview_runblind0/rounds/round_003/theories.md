# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Noisy Equal Weights (Tallying): Decision-makers find integrating specific cue validities too cognitively demanding. Instead, they evaluate options by simply counting the number of positive features (1s) for each option, treating all cues equally, and preferring the option with the higher total. However, their choices are dominated by an extremely high lapse rate (epsilon ~0.90-1.0), meaning they almost always guess randomly. This accounts for the observed aggregate behavior being essentially at chance across multiple experimental metrics.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the Noisy Tallying mechanism is kept exactly the same, but the epsilon parameter range is shifted higher to [0.90, 1.0]. This minimal edit further washes out the deterministic tallying predictions, bringing the simulated metrics closer to the near-perfectly random behavior (0.50 choice proportion / 0.0 score difference) observed in the human data across experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.9, 1.0]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Count the number of positive features (1s) for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a)
    score_b = np.sum(b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Noisy Take-The-Best: Decision-makers evaluate options lexicographically, starting with the most valid cue and stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the options. However, the execution of this heuristic is highly stochastic, characterized by a massive lapse rate. Because the observed aggregate behavior is very close to random guessing (~0.50), the theory posits that subjects frequently suffer from attentional lapses or guess uniformly, effectively washing out the deterministic TTB predictions with heavy noise.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, this model instantiates a 'Noisy Take-The-Best' (Lexicographic) theory. It uses the standard TTB stopping rule (checking cues in descending validity order until one discriminates) but incorporates massive response noise to capture the ~0.50 empirical metrics across experiments. By constraining the lapse rate `epsilon` to a very high range [0.7, 1.0], the model acknowledges the heavy stochasticity in human data, providing a non-compensatory heuristic alternative to WADD while correcting the deterministic failure of the previous TTB model.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.7, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    # Sort cues by descending validity
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break
            
    if winner is None:
        p_core = np.ones(2) / 2.0
    else:
        scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])
        beta = float(parameters["beta"])
        z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
        e = np.exp(z)
        p_core = e / e.sum()
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(2) / 2.0)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Noisy Weighted Additive (WADD): Decision-makers compute a fully compensatory, weighted sum of the features for each option, using the provided cue validities as weights. They then choose based on the difference in these weighted sums. However, the execution of this strategy is highly stochastic, characterized by a massive lapse rate. Because the observed aggregate behavior is very close to random guessing (~0.50), the theory posits that subjects frequently suffer from attentional lapses or guess uniformly, effectively washing out the deterministic WADD predictions with heavy noise.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory replaces the Noisy Take-The-Best mechanism with a Noisy Weighted Additive (WADD) mechanism. It computes a fully compensatory weighted sum of features using the provided cue validities. To capture the near-random aggregate behavior observed across the experiments (where most metrics hover around 0.50), the model is constrained to have a very high lapse rate (epsilon in [0.8, 1.0]). This approach explicitly weights cues by their validity, capturing subtle deviations from 0.50 that Tallying might miss, while still respecting the heavily noise-dominated nature of the subjects' choices.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.8, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features for each option
    scores = np.sum(stim * val, axis=1)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)

    n_opts = len(scores)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    p = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    p /= p.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(p), p=p)
```
