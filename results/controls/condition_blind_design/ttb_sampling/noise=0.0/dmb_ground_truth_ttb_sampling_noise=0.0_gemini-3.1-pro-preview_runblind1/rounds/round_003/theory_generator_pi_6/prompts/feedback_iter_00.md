# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace the Logistic Choice Model with a 'Strategy Selection / Adaptive Toolbox' theory. Instead of assuming a single compensatory mechanism with non-linear weights, this new theory should posit that decision-makers probabilistically select between different simple heuristics on a trial-by-trial or subject-by-subject basis. For example, a mixture model where agents predominantly use Take-The-Best but have a certain probability of falling back to 'Tallying' (simply counting the number of positive features without weighting them by validity) when confidence is low. This preserves the non-compensatory nature of the data while allowing for slight deviations from strict TTB.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Adaptive Toolbox (Strategy Selection): Decision-makers do not rely on a single, fixed compensatory or non-compensatory mechanism. Instead, they probabilistically select from a 'toolbox' of simple heuristics on a trial-by-trial basis. In this domain, agents predominantly use the lexicographic Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic, but with some probability they fall back to a simple 'Tallying' heuristic (counting the number of positive features without weighting them by validity). This mixture preserves the largely non-compensatory choice patterns observed in the data while naturally accounting for specific systematic deviations from strict TTB that a uniform lapse rate cannot explain.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    p_tally = float(parameters["p_tally"])
    
    # Take-The-Best (TTB) Mechanism
    order = np.argsort(-validities, kind='mergesort')
    p_ttb = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            p_ttb = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    # Tallying Mechanism (Equal Weights)
    sum_a = np.sum(a)
    sum_b = np.sum(b)
    if sum_a > sum_b:
        p_tally_arr = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif sum_b > sum_a:
        p_tally_arr = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        p_tally_arr = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    # Probabilistic Strategy Selection
    p_mix = (1.0 - p_tally) * p_ttb + p_tally * p_tally_arr
    
    # Incorporate baseline lapse rate (random guessing)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_mix + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- p_tally: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory abandons the single-mechanism Logistic Choice Model (Weighted Additive) in favor of the Adaptive Toolbox framework. It implements a probabilistic mixture model where decision-makers predominantly rely on Take-The-Best (TTB) but occasionally switch to Tallying (unweighted feature summation). This explains the slight deviations from strict TTB observed in experiments (e.g., Experiment 4, where the real value is 0.18, higher than what pure TTB with lapses predicts) by introducing structured, heuristic-driven noise rather than relying purely on random lapses or fully compensatory integration.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2044 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2044.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate theory successfully implemented the arbiter's recommended Adaptive Toolbox family, mixing Take-The-Best (TTB) and Tallying. This was accepted by the gate and improved the aggregate loss. However, the unconditional mixing of Tallying introduces a systematic artifact in Experiments 7 and 8. In these experiments, the metric measures the difference in accuracy between 'high difference' and 'low difference' trials. Because Tallying tends to agree with TTB on high-difference trials but ties on low-difference trials, an unconditional `p_tally` artificially inflates accuracy on high-diff trials relative to low-diff trials, yielding a difference of ~0.10 (whereas human data shows ~0.0). Additionally, the unconditional mix dilutes overall accuracy in Experiments 1-3.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "To fix the artifacts in Experiments 7 and 8 while maintaining the prescribed Adaptive Toolbox family, operationalize the arbiter's suggestion to fall back to Tallying 'when confidence is low'. Instead of a fixed `p_tally` across all trials, make the probability of using Tallying inversely proportional to the validity of the feature that TTB uses to discriminate. For instance, if TTB terminates on a highly valid feature (e.g., validity > 0.8), the probability of falling back to Tallying should be near zero; if it terminates on a weak feature, the fallback probability should be higher. Introduce a parameter (like a validity threshold or a scaling factor) to control this confidence-dependent fallback. This minor adjustment within the family will preserve TTB's strictness on high-validity trials (fixing Exps 1-3, 7, 8) while allowing Tallying to explain variance on lower-confidence trials."
