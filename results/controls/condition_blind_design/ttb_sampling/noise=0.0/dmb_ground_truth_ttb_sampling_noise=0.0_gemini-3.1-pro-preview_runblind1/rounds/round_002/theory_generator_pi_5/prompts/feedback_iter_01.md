# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a completely new theory to serve as a structurally distinct competitor to Take-The-Best. A strong candidate is the Weighted Additive Model (WADD) or a Logistic Choice model. Instead of a non-compensatory lexicographic rule, this theory should assume that decision-makers compute a weighted sum of all features for each option (using the validities as weights) and make a probabilistic choice using a softmax function (introducing a temperature parameter). This compensatory model will contrast sharply with TTB on trials where multiple low-validity features oppose a single high-validity feature, enabling better discrimination between compensatory and non-compensatory decision-making processes.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Logistic Choice Model (Weighted Additive with Non-linear Validity Scaling): Decision-makers integrate all available information by computing a weighted sum of the features for each option. However, the subjective weights placed on these features are a non-linear scaling of their objective validities, governed by an exponent parameter (gamma). This allows the compensatory process to approximate non-compensatory heuristics when gamma is large, as the highest-validity features will dominate the weighted sum. The choice is made probabilistically by passing these weighted sums through a softmax function, modulated by an inverse temperature parameter (beta) to capture choice determinism, along with a baseline lapse rate (epsilon) for random guessing.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Non-linear scaling of validities to compute subjective weights
    weights = validities ** gamma
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features using subjective weights
    scores = stim @ weights
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    p_core = np.exp(z)
    p_core /= p_core.sum()
    
    # Incorporate lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, I added a 'gamma' exponent parameter to non-linearly scale the validities before using them as feature weights. This minimal edit keeps the model entirely within the compensatory Weighted Additive family while allowing it to fit non-compensatory-like empirical choice patterns (such as in Experiment 4) by having higher 'gamma' values that cause the highest-validity feature to dominate the sum.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4004 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3087 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3087.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the Logistic Choice (Weighted Additive) model as prescribed by the arbiter. However, using raw validities as weights results in poor fits to human behavior across several experiments. Most notably, in Experiment 4, the model predicts a choice rate of 0.6833 on a critical trial, whereas the empirical data shows a choice rate of 0.1800 (indicating humans strongly prefer the option favored by the single highest-validity feature, acting non-compensatorily). The model also underestimates the consistency of choices in Experiments 1, 2, and 3.
Rationale: To improve the fit while strictly remaining within the prescribed Weighted Additive (compensatory) family, you should introduce a non-linear scaling parameter for the validities. Specifically, add a `gamma` exponent parameter (e.g., range [0.1, 10.0]) and compute the feature weights as `weights = validities ** gamma`. This allows the model to dynamically stretch the differences between high and low validities. When `gamma` > 1, the highest-validity feature dominates the weighted sum, allowing this compensatory model to better capture the non-compensatory-like empirical patterns (such as in Experiment 4) without changing the core structural mechanism.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4004 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3087 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The introduction of the `gamma` parameter successfully allowed the model to capture the non-compensatory-like behavior in Experiment 4, bringing the predicted metric down from 0.6833 to 0.2267 (closely matching the empirical 0.1800). However, across Experiments 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, the model consistently underestimates the empirical choice consistency, predicting values around 0.73-0.78 when the true human data shows consistencies of 0.82-0.87. This indicates the model is currently too noisy or constrained from reaching higher determinism.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The current mechanism is excellent and should be kept exactly as is. However, to fix the underestimation of choice consistency across the majority of the experiments, adjust the parameter ranges to allow for more deterministic behavior. Because validities are < 1, raising them to a high `gamma` power shrinks the absolute magnitude of the scores, meaning `beta` needs to be larger to achieve the same level of softmax determinism. I recommend increasing the upper bound of `beta` to 50.0 (e.g., `[0.1, 50.0]`) and restricting the lapse rate `epsilon` to a more realistic range for these tasks, such as `[0.0, 0.1]` or `[0.0, 0.2]`, to prevent excessive random guessing from dragging down the expected consistency."
