# generation_iter_03_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Propose a 'Tallying' (Equal Weight) theory as a new competitor to Take-The-Best. Tallying ignores cue validities entirely and simply counts the number of positive features for each option, choosing the one with the higher count (and guessing on a tie). This provides a distinct, cognitively plausible heuristic alternative that is compensatory with respect to features but non-compensatory with respect to validities, serving as a stronger and simpler benchmark than WADD.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 1.000)

**Description**
Take-The-Best (TTB) assumes that decision-makers do not integrate all information or simply count features. Instead, they rank features by their subjective or instructed validity and compare options lexicographically. They stop at the first feature that discriminates between the two options and choose the one with the higher value on that feature. If all features tie, they guess.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.206)

**Description**
People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1191 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.5516 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.7239 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1191 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Confidence-Weighted Take-The-Best: Decision-makers process information lexicographically, ranking features by their validity. They stop at the first feature that discriminates between the two options. However, rather than making a perfectly deterministic choice based on this single feature, their probability of choosing the favored option scales with the validity of that discriminating feature. A highly valid discriminating cue yields a near-deterministic choice, whereas a marginally valid cue (closer to 0.5) results in a choice probability closer to chance.

def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)

            # Option A favored
            # Scale confidence by how much the validity exceeds chance (0.5)

    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.0, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: I am explicitly ignoring the arbiter's suggestion to propose a Tallying (Equal Weight) model. The leaderboard demonstrates that Tallying (pi_1) has an overall score of 0.000, failing completely to capture the empirical metrics (e.g., predicting 0.8633 on Exp 4 where the real value is 0.1800). The data is overwhelmingly consistent with a non-compensatory, validity-based lexicographic heuristic (Take-The-Best, pi_3, score 1.000). To provide a meaningful theoretical contribution without degrading performance, I propose a 'Confidence-Weighted Take-The-Best' model. This retains the core lexicographic search order that successfully fits the data but replaces the fixed deterministic choice at the discriminating cue with a probabilistic choice scaled by the validity of that specific cue. This introduces a cognitively plausible mechanism where confidence in a one-reason decision depends on the strength of that reason, while preserving the excellent fit to the empirical benchmarks.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate achieved a good fit to the data (e.g., matching the strong preference for TTB-aligned choices in Exp 1-3 and the low WADD-aligned rate in Exp 4). However, the proposer explicitly ignored the arbiter's recommendation to implement a Tallying (Equal Weight) model, instead opting to build a Confidence-Weighted Take-The-Best model. While the empirical fit is strong, this violates the requirement to stay within the prescribed mechanism family.
Rationale: You explicitly drifted from the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family. You MUST return to the prescribed family (Tallying / Equal Weight). It is the arbiter's prerogative to change families, not yours. To help Tallying fit the data better without changing the family, you can add minor adjustments: for example, implement a 'Soft Tallying' model that applies a softmax (with a temperature parameter) over the tally scores rather than acting deterministically, or introduce a validity threshold where only features with a validity above a certain cutoff are tallied. Do not revert to a lexicographic TTB model.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1191 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.5516 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate 'Thresholded Tallying' attempted to follow the arbiter's prescription to use the Tallying family, but its fit to the empirical data was significantly worse than the running-best base (which drifted into TTB). Consequently, the programmatic gate rejected this candidate, meaning the proposer will again build on the TTB-based Iteration 1. However, the arbiter's constraint to use Tallying (Equal Weight) remains strictly in effect.
Rationale: Your previous attempt at Thresholded Tallying was rejected by the gate because its empirical fit could not beat the TTB-based Iteration 1. Since the loop resets to Iteration 1, you are currently starting from a TTB model again. You MUST convert this base back into the prescribed Tallying family. To ensure the new Tallying model is competitive enough to be accepted, try a different in-family adjustment: implement a 'Relaxed Tallying' model that tallies all features equally but uses the maximum cue validity strictly as a tie-breaker, or allow the validity threshold parameter to span a wider range [0.0, 1.0] while utilizing a much sharper softmax temperature (beta up to 50.0) to better match the deterministic nature of human choices on these specific experiments.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.5516 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.7239 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The 'Thresholded Tallying' candidate was rejected by the gate because its fit to the empirical data (loss=0.7239) was significantly worse than the running-best TTB-based model (loss=0.1191). The empirical data across all four experiments shows strong lexicographic (TTB-like) behavior. The threshold approach failed because absolute validities vary across experiments, making a single fixed threshold parameter unable to consistently isolate the most valid cue across different experimental designs. Consequently, the model predicted too many ties or reversed preferences (e.g., Exp 4 metric jumped to 0.5433, far from the empirical 0.1800).
Rationale: Since the last candidate was rejected, the loop has reset to the Iteration 1 base (which drifted into TTB). You must again convert this base into the prescribed Tallying (Equal Weight) family, but we need a mechanism that can robustly recover TTB-like behavior to beat the current loss. Instead of a fixed validity threshold, implement a 'Top-K Tallying' model. Introduce an integer parameter K (range [1, 4]). The model should rank features by their validity and only tally the wins/losses among the Top K most valid features. If K=1, this elegantly reduces to Take-The-Best, allowing the model to match the strong empirical TTB behavior while remaining structurally within the Tallying family. Retain the softmax temperature (beta) and lapse rate (epsilon) to handle noise.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.7239 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
