# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_4") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Decision-makers use the 'Take The Best' (TTB) heuristic, a non-compensatory lexicographic strategy. Features are ranked by their validity, and options are compared on features one by one in descending order of validity. The choice is determined entirely by the first feature that discriminates between the options, ignoring all lower-validity cues.

    import numpy as np

        raise ValueError("TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

## THEORY 2 — pi_4
Rank-Weighted Additive Theory: Decision-makers evaluate options using a compensatory but steeply decaying weighting scheme. Instead of using raw validities as weights, they rank features by their validity and assign exponentially decaying weights based on their rank (e.g., w_k = decay_rate^{-k}). This creates a 'soft' lexicographic strategy that largely mimics Take The Best by making the most valid cue dominant, but allows for compensation if multiple lower-ranked cues unanimously oppose the top cue.

### METRIC
Rationale:
Take The Best (TTB) uses only the first discriminating feature, ignoring the rest. Because it just assigns a binary 1/0 score to the winner/loser regardless of how many features support the choice or the validity of the deciding feature, TTB's predicted choice probability is identical across all trials (modulo noise). In contrast, Rank-Weighted Additive Theory (RWAT) accumulates evidence across all features, producing a large score difference when all features align (Trial 14) and a very small score difference when only the lowest-ranked feature discriminates (Trial 7). Thus, the difference in accuracy between Trial 14 and Trial 7 will be exactly 0 under TTB, but significantly greater than 0 under RWAT.

### METRIC
Rationale:
Take The Best (TTB) uses a strict lexicographic rule. It decides based solely on the highest-validity cue that discriminates the options, completely ignoring any opposing lower-validity cues. Therefore, the probability of choosing the option favored by the best cue should be identical regardless of how many lower cues oppose it. Rank-Weighted Additive (RWA) integrates all cues using a decaying weight scheme. Thus, when multiple lower-validity cues oppose the highest-validity cue, the evidence margin shrinks, pulling the choice probability towards 0.5. By taking the difference in choice probabilities between trials with strong opposition vs. weak/no opposition, TTB will predict a difference near zero, whereas RWA will predict a significantly positive difference.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the majority of experiments, Take The Best (Theory 1) provides a much better fit to the observed data. In Experiment 1, the observed metric is near zero, perfectly matching TTB's prediction that unanimous lower-validity cues do not increase choice probability over a single deciding cue. Experiment 6 similarly shows that compensatory choices predicted by RWAT (Theory 2) do not occur at the rates expected (observed 0.1333 aligns well with TTB's 0.1550, while RWAT predicts 0.3250). RWAT systematically over-predicts the degree of compensation. Theory 1 (TTB) is a very strong baseline. Theory 2 should be replaced with a qualitatively different alternative that might explain the slight deviations from TTB.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Two-Stage' or 'Take-Two' heuristic. For instance, decision-makers might first look at the top two most valid features. If they point in the same direction, a choice is made; if they conflict, the decision-maker either guesses or relies on the third feature. Alternatively, propose a 'Tallying' heuristic where subjects simply count the number of positive features for each option, ignoring validities entirely. This provides a fundamentally different mechanism (validity-ignoring vs. validity-driven) to contrast against TTB."
