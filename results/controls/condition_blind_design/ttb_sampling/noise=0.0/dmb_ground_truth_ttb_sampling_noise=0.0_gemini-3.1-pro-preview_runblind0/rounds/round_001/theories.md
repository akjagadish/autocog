# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Decision-makers use the 'Take The Best' (TTB) heuristic, a non-compensatory lexicographic strategy. Features are ranked by their validity, and options are compared on features one by one in descending order of validity. The choice is determined entirely by the first feature that discriminates between the options, ignoring all lower-validity cues.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this model instantiates the Take The Best (TTB) heuristic. Instead of summing features (like Tallying or WADD), TTB sorts features by validity and makes a choice based solely on the highest-validity feature that discriminates between the options. This non-compensatory mechanism naturally accounts for the extreme sensitivity to high-validity cues observed in Experiment 2, where a single predictive feature can strongly dominate the choice over multiple weaker features.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Rank features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    scores = np.array([0.0, 0.0])
    # Lexicographic evaluation
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            scores[0] = 1.0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            scores[1] = 1.0
            break
            
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the binary scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * 0.5
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Rank-Weighted Additive Theory: Decision-makers evaluate options using a compensatory but steeply decaying weighting scheme. Instead of using raw validities as weights, they rank features by their validity and assign exponentially decaying weights based on their rank (e.g., w_k = decay_rate^{-k}). This creates a 'soft' lexicographic strategy that largely mimics Take The Best by making the most valid cue dominant, but allows for compensation if multiple lower-ranked cues unanimously oppose the top cue.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory implements a 'soft' lexicographic model. By ranking features by validity and assigning exponentially decaying weights (controlled by a decay_rate parameter), the model bridges the gap between the strict non-compensatory Take The Best (TTB) heuristic and the fully compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) model. A decay rate close to 2.0 ensures the top cue is usually decisive, but allows a coalition of lower-ranked cues to outvote it, capturing human behavior more robustly across experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `decay_rate`: `[1.5, 4.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Rank-Weighted Additive expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    decay_rate = float(parameters["decay_rate"])
    
    # Rank features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    # Assign exponentially decaying weights based on rank
    weights = np.zeros_like(validities)
    for k, idx in enumerate(order):
        weights[idx] = decay_rate ** (-k)
        
    # Compute weighted sum for each option
    scores = stim @ weights
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the scores with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
