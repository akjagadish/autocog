# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic: People make decisions between multi-attribute options by ranking features according to their validities and comparing the options lexicographically. The decision-maker examines the feature with the highest validity first; if one option is strictly better on that feature, it is chosen immediately and no further features are considered. If there is a tie, they move to the second most valid feature, and so on. This non-compensatory, one-reason decision making process implies that a single highly valid cue can completely determine the choice, overriding any number of smaller advantages on less valid cues.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's recommendation, this proposes the Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. Unlike Tallying (which ignores validities) or WADD (which computes a compensatory sum), TTB is a non-compensatory lexicographic rule. It evaluates features sequentially by validity, making a deterministic choice based solely on the first discriminating feature. Response noise is handled via a standard lapse rate epsilon. This captures the strong directional effects seen in the data where decisions are driven entirely by the most informative cue.

**Parameters:**
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Rank features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    choice = None
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            choice = 0
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            choice = 1
            break
            
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    n_opts = 2
    
    if choice is None:
        p_core = np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts
    else:
        p_core = np.zeros(n_opts)
        p_core[choice] = 1.0
        
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by computing, for each option, a weighted sum of its feature values, where each feature is weighted by its subjective validity (or importance). The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen. WADD is the compensatory benchmark against which one-reason heuristics like Take The Best are contrasted: a large deficit on a high-validity cue can be compensated by a sufficiently strong advantage on lower-validity cues, so no single feature is ever decisive on its own. Unlike Tallying, WADD uses cardinal feature magnitudes and weights them by validity, so it exploits both the sign and the size of each feature-wise comparison as well as inter-cue differences in informativeness. Unlike Equal-Weight, weights differ across features. Behavior is invariant to a shared affine rescaling across options but scales linearly with per-feature weight. When the two weighted sums are equal the model has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two weighted sums with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Weighted Additive rule (Payne, Bettman & Johnson
    # 1993). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the
    # current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 =
    # option A, row 1 = option B. Each option's score is the dot
    # product of its feature vector with the (subjective) validity
    # weights. History is ignored: the choice depends only on the
    # current stimulus.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = np.asarray(parameters["weights"], dtype=float)
    if w.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"weights length {w.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )

    # Weighted sum per option (dot product with per-feature weights).
    scores = stim @ (validities * w)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    # Uniform lapse blended into the softmax (standard choice-with-lapse
    # formulation; epsilon=0.5 yields equiprobable options, matching
    # the paper's maximum-noise condition).
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB): People evaluate cues sequentially to make decisions, but the sequence is stochastic rather than strictly deterministic. The probability of sampling a cue is proportional to an exponential function of its subjective validity. When sampling without replacement, the probability that the first discriminating cue encountered is cue $i$ is exactly proportional to its weight among all discriminating cues. This model bridges Tallying (when temperature is high/gamma is 0, all cues are equally likely to be the deciding one) and deterministic Take-The-Best (when gamma is large, the highest validity cue almost always determines the choice), providing a nuanced non-compensatory heuristic.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the parameter ranges for gamma and epsilon have been adjusted to find the sweet spot between iteration 1 (under-predicting deterministic choices) and iteration 2 (over-predicting). Setting gamma to [0.0, 35.0] and epsilon to [0.0, 0.3] should soften the model just enough to perfectly match the ~0.80-0.85 empirical match rates without falling back into excessive random guessing.

**Parameters:**
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 35.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.3]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

        raise ValueError("PTTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Identify cues that discriminate between the two options
    discrim = (a != b)
    
    if not np.any(discrim):
        # No discriminating cues, guess uniformly
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        # The probability of a discriminating cue being the first one found
        # is proportional to exp(gamma * validity).
        val_discrim = validities[discrim]
        # Max-subtraction for numerical stability
        z = gamma * (val_discrim - np.max(val_discrim))
        w = np.exp(z)
        w = w / np.sum(w)
        
        # The probability of choosing an option is the sum of the probabilities
        # of the discriminating cues that favor it.
        p_a = np.sum(w[a[discrim] > b[discrim]])
        p_b = np.sum(w[b[discrim] > a[discrim]])
        
        p_core = np.array([p_a, p_b])
        
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
