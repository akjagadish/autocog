# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Tallying with Recency/Right-Most Tie-Breaker: Decision makers primarily evaluate options by tallying the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other, ignoring feature validities (equal weighting). If one option has more winning features, it is chosen. However, if the feature wins are tied, individuals do not simply guess. Instead, they rely on a 'recency' or 'right-most' bias, breaking the tie based solely on the last feature in the array. Responses are subject to softmax noise over the resulting scores and a uniform lapse rate.

**Rationale:** The arbiter noted that subjects in Experiment 1 systematically favored the option that won on the last feature when total feature wins were tied, leading to a sub-0.5 match rate with TTB on those trials. This new theory preserves the excellent fit of Tallying on Experiment 2 (where Tallying makes strict predictions) but replaces the random guessing on tied trials with a deterministic tie-breaker based on the right-most feature. By doing so, it captures the 'recency bias' observed in Experiment 1 without disrupting the primary tallying mechanism.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Primary mechanism: Tallying strict feature-wise wins
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    
    # Tie-breaking mechanism: Recency/Right-most feature bias
    if a_wins == b_wins:
        if a[-1] > b[-1]:
            a_wins += 1.0
        elif b[-1] > a[-1]:
            b_wins += 1.0
            
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    
    beta = float(parameters['beta'])
    epsilon = float(parameters['epsilon'])
    
    # Softmax choice with numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Incorporate lapse rate
    n_opts = len(scores)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Recency-Weighted Tallying: Decision makers evaluate options by computing a weighted tally of feature wins. Due to recency effects in working memory, features presented later (further to the right) are more salient and receive exponentially increasing weights. Because the growth rate of these weights is bounded, the heuristic strictly preserves standard tallying when one option has more feature wins than the other. However, when the number of feature wins is tied, the exponentially increasing weights naturally break the tie in favor of the option that wins on the most recent (right-most) features, providing a continuous and elegant mechanism for tie-breaking without invoking discontinuous rules.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, this Recency-Weighted Tallying theory replaces the rigid tie-breaker rule of pi_3 with a continuous mechanism. By weighting feature wins with an exponentially increasing weight from left to right (using `recency_base` in [1.01, 1.3]), the model perfectly preserves the primary tallying heuristic when the number of wins is unequal (since the maximum sum of k weights is strictly less than the minimum sum of k+1 weights for these bases). However, when the number of wins is tied, the exponential weights naturally favor the option that wins on the right-most feature (e.g., 1 + rho^3 > rho + rho^2), elegantly explaining the ~0.82 choice probabilities in tie-breaker trials without discontinuous rules.

**Parameters:**
  - `recency_base`: `[1.01, 1.3]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    n_features = len(a)
    
    recency_base = float(parameters['recency_base'])
    beta = float(parameters['beta'])
    epsilon = float(parameters['epsilon'])
    
    # Weights exponentially increasing from left to right to model recency in working memory.
    # For recency_base in [1.01, 1.3], the sum of any k weights is strictly less 
    # than the sum of any k+1 weights, preserving the strict tallying property for unequal wins.
    w = recency_base ** np.arange(n_features)
    
    # Weighted tallying of strict feature-wise wins
    a_wins = float(np.sum(w * (a > b)))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(w * (b > a)))
    
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    
    # Softmax choice with numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Incorporate lapse rate
    n_opts = len(scores)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
