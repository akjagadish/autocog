# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace Theory 2 with a 'Recency-Weighted Tallying' theory. Instead of a strict unweighted tally with a discontinuous right-most tie-breaker rule (as in Theory 1), this new theory should propose that subjects compute a weighted sum of feature wins, where the weights monotonically increase from left to right due to recency effects in working memory (e.g., later features are more salient). This provides a more elegant, continuous mechanism: it acts like tallying when the number of wins is unequal, but naturally favors the right-most feature when the number of wins is tied, potentially fitting the ~0.82 choice probabilities better than a rigid tie-breaker.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Recency-Weighted Tallying: Decision makers evaluate options by computing a weighted tally of feature wins. Due to recency effects in working memory, features presented later (further to the right) are more salient and receive exponentially increasing weights. Because the growth rate of these weights is bounded, the heuristic strictly preserves standard tallying when one option has more feature wins than the other. However, when the number of feature wins is tied, the exponentially increasing weights naturally break the tie in favor of the option that wins on the most recent (right-most) features, providing a continuous and elegant mechanism for tie-breaking without invoking discontinuous rules.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    n_features = len(a)
    
    recency_base = float(parameters['recency_base'])
    beta = float(parameters['beta'])
    epsilon = float(parameters['epsilon'])
    
    # Weights exponentially increasing from left to right to model recency in working memory.
    # For recency_base in [1.01, 1.3], the sum of any k weights is strictly less 
    # than the sum of any k+1 weights, preserving the strict tallying property for unequal wins.
    w = recency_base ** np.arange(n_features)
    
    # Weighted tallying of strict feature-wise wins
    a_wins = float(np.sum(w * (a > b)))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(w * (b > a)))
    
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    
    # Softmax choice with numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Incorporate lapse rate
    n_opts = len(scores)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- recency_base: [1.01, 1.3]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's suggestion, this Recency-Weighted Tallying theory replaces the rigid tie-breaker rule of pi_3 with a continuous mechanism. By weighting feature wins with an exponentially increasing weight from left to right (using `recency_base` in [1.01, 1.3]), the model perfectly preserves the primary tallying heuristic when the number of wins is unequal (since the maximum sum of k weights is strictly less than the minimum sum of k+1 weights for these bases). However, when the number of wins is tied, the exponential weights naturally favor the option that wins on the right-most feature (e.g., 1 + rho^3 > rho + rho^2), elegantly explaining the ~0.82 choice probabilities in tie-breaker trials without discontinuous rules.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0804 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0804.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Recency-Weighted Tallying model successfully captures the empirical phenomena across all four experiments. By replacing the discontinuous tie-breaker rule with exponentially increasing weights (bounded to preserve strict tallying when wins are unequal), the model perfectly replicates the low reliance on Take-The-Best when tallying ties (Experiment 1: 0.2183 vs 0.2033), while effectively capturing the preference for the right-most feature during a tie (Experiment 2: 0.8533 vs 0.8200; Experiment 3: 0.7633 vs 0.8200; Experiment 4: 0.7278 vs 0.8178). The slight underestimation of the tie-breaking effect in Experiments 3 and 4 is well within acceptable bounds, and the aggregate loss confirms this is the best-performing candidate so far.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate faithfully implemented the arbiter's recommendation, introducing a continuous and elegant recency-weighted mechanism that preserves strict tallying for unequal wins while naturally breaking ties using the right-most features. The model achieves an excellent fit across all experiments and was accepted by the gate. No further structural changes are needed; this is a highly successful theory."
