# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_4" and "pi_5") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_4
Majority Rule with Reverse Lexicographic Tie-Breaking. People primarily use Tallying (equal weighting) to compare options, counting the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other. If one option wins on more features, it is chosen. However, if there is a tie in the tally, subjects break the tie by consulting cues in ASCENDING order of validity (least valid first). This perfectly captures why subjects follow Tallying in general, but systematically oppose both Weighted Additive (WADD) and Take The Best (TTB) predictions specifically on trials where Tallying results in a tie.

## THEORY 2 — pi_5
Compensatory Attention in Tallying: People primarily use a simple Tallying heuristic (equal weighting) to compare options because it is cognitively economical. However, when Tallying results in a tie, subjects experience uncertainty. To resolve this, they direct their remaining cognitive effort toward the cues they are most uncertain about—the least valid cues. They break the tie using a compensatory strategy where cues are weighted inversely to their validity, effectively approximating a Take-The-Worst heuristic through negative weighting.

### METRIC
Rationale:
Both theories predict the exact same choice on every trial in this experimental design: they both rely on Tallying for non-tie trials, and for tie trials, the Competing theory's compensatory weights (which are 1 - validity) strictly enforce the exact same choice as the Advocated theory's reverse lexicographic tie-breaker. However, they differ radically in their confidence (choice probabilities) during tie trials. Under the Advocated theory, the score difference is 1.0 for both tie and non-tie trials, leading to identical choice consistency. Under the Competing theory, the score difference for tie trials is much smaller (0.21 to 0.47) than for non-tie trials (1.0), meaning choices on tie trials should be much noisier. The metric measures the difference in choice consistency between non-tie and tie trials. It will be near 0 for the Advocated theory, and strictly positive for the Competing theory.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Both theories predict that subjects will choose Option B on Trial 13 and Trial 16, as both are tie-breaker trials. However, the Competing theory (Reverse Lexicographic) resolves both ties using the least valid cue (cue 3) as the sole decider, generating an identical, maximal score difference of 1.0 for both trials. In contrast, the Advocated theory (Compensatory Attention) weighs all tied cues inversely to their validity. On Trial 16, the score difference is 0.19, but on Trial 13, opposing cues nearly cancel out, yielding a minimal score difference of 0.04. Consequently, the Advocated theory predicts a significantly higher probability of choosing B on Trial 16 than on Trial 13, whereas the Competing theory predicts no difference. (Fixes the previous pandas ValueError by using tuples instead of lists for comparison).

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across the eight experiments, Theory 1 (pi_4, Reverse Lexicographic Tie-Breaking) generally outperforms Theory 2 (pi_5, Compensatory Attention). Theory 1 accurately captures the observed behavior in Experiments 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8, predicting the metric values closely. However, both theories fail to capture the negative metric observed in Experiment 1. In Experiment 1, the observed metric is -0.0524, indicating that subjects' choices are more consistent on 'tie' trials than on 'non-tie' trials. Theory 1 predicts a difference of near 0, and Theory 2 predicts a positive difference. This suggests that the tie-breaking mechanism might actually be a primary driver of choice, or at least generates higher confidence/consistency than Tallying. Since Theory 1 is strong but misses this crucial detail, Theory 2 should be replaced with a completely new theory that can account for this higher consistency on tie trials.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a new theory that departs from the 'Tallying first, then tie-break' framework. To explain why choices are more consistent on 'tie' trials (as defined by Tallying) than on 'non-tie' trials, the new theory should posit a mechanism where the cues that typically break ties (e.g., the least valid cues) are actually given disproportionate weight or attention globally, not just during ties. For instance, a 'Salience-Biased Weighted Additive' model where subjects overweigh cues with lower validities because they feel more novel or salient, leading to highly consistent choices when these cues strongly favor one option (which often coincides with Tallying ties)."
