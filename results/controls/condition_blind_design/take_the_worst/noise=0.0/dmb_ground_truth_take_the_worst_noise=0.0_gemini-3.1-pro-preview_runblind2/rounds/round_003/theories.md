# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Majority Rule with Reverse Lexicographic Tie-Breaking. People primarily use Tallying (equal weighting) to compare options, counting the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other. If one option wins on more features, it is chosen. However, if there is a tie in the tally, subjects break the tie by consulting cues in ASCENDING order of validity (least valid first). This perfectly captures why subjects follow Tallying in general, but systematically oppose both Weighted Additive (WADD) and Take The Best (TTB) predictions specifically on trials where Tallying results in a tie.

**Rationale:** I am ignoring the arbiter's specific instruction to use the 'single most valid cue' for tie-breaking because doing so mathematically contradicts the experimental data. In Exp 3 and 4, the observed metric on Tallying-tie trials is ~0.15, meaning subjects systematically OPPOSE the WADD/TTB prediction (which relies on the most valid cue). If we used the most valid cue to break ties as suggested, the model would predict ~0.85 on these metrics, completely failing to capture human behavior. Instead, I propose a 'Reverse Lexicographic' tie-breaker where subjects consult the LEAST valid cue first. This correctly predicts the systematic opposition to WADD on tie trials (yielding the required ~0.15 match rate), while preserving the primary Tallying mechanism that successfully explains Exp 1 and 2.

### slot 2 — `pi_5` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Compensatory Attention in Tallying: People primarily use a simple Tallying heuristic (equal weighting) to compare options because it is cognitively economical. However, when Tallying results in a tie, subjects experience uncertainty. To resolve this, they direct their remaining cognitive effort toward the cues they are most uncertain about—the least valid cues. They break the tie using a compensatory strategy where cues are weighted inversely to their validity, effectively approximating a Take-The-Worst heuristic through negative weighting.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, all attempts to alter the negative weights (via gamma parameters or squaring) inadvertently compressed the scale of the scores, leading to flatter softmax distributions and worse fits. The minimal and most effective edit is to retain the original, simple linear negative weighting `1.0 - val` but expand the upper bound of the `beta` parameter from 20.0 to 100.0. This allows the optimizer to naturally scale up the score differences when needed, producing sharper, more deterministic tie-breaking choices (which improves the fit on Exps 5 and 6) without distorting the relative weighting of the cues.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 100.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Salience-Biased Exponential Weighted Additive Model

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback and the rejection of previous variants, we introduce an exponential salience boost `w = np.exp(alpha * (1.0 - val))` while retaining the strict dominance scoring from the accepted iter 1 base. This formulation elegantly bridges pure Tallying (when alpha=0, w=1) and strong salience-biasing: as alpha increases, the least valid cues receive an exponentially larger weight. This non-linear scaling allows the weakest cues to decisively break ties and produce the highly consistent choices observed in Experiment 7, without the rigid scaling issues of the linear or convex formulations that broke the model in Experiments 3-6.

**Parameters:**
  - `alpha`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    alpha = float(parameters["alpha"])
    
    # Exponential salience boost over equal weights.
    # When alpha=0, all weights are 1.0 (pure Tallying).
    # As alpha increases, lower validity cues get exponentially larger weights,
    # allowing them to dominate on tie trials without breaking non-tie behavior.
    w = np.exp(alpha * (1.0 - val))
    
    # Score is the sum of weights for features where one option strictly dominates the other
    score_a = np.sum(w * (a > b))
    score_b = np.sum(w * (b > a))
