# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_4" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_4" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_4
People process feature arrays from right to left, exhibiting a recency or layout bias. Instead of consulting cues in order of their objective validities, subjects use a Right-to-Left Take-The-Best (R2L-TTB) heuristic. They evaluate features starting from the last index down to the first, choosing the option that wins on the first discriminating feature encountered in this reversed order. If no feature discriminates, they guess. Response noise is incorporated via a softmax over the binary winner score and a constant lapse rate.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:

        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break

    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### METRIC
Rationale:
Focuses on two specific diagnostic trials (Trials 11 and 12) where Right-to-Left Take-The-Best (R2L-TTB) strongly contradicts Tallying. For example, in Trial 11, Option A has more positive features (wins 2-1 overall, favoring Tallying), but Option B has a positive feature at the rightmost index while Option A does not (favoring R2L-TTB). The metric calculates the proportion of choices across these trial types that align with R2L-TTB.

**Rationale:** (no rationale)

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Focuses on trial 9 where Option A is [0, 1, 1, 0] and Option B is [0, 0, 0, 1]. Tallying prefers Option A because it wins on two features compared to Option B's one feature. R2L-TTB, processing from right to left, immediately selects Option B because it wins on the rightmost feature (index 3). The metric calculates the proportion of times the choice aligns with the R2L-TTB prediction (i.e., choosing the [0, 0, 0, 1] option), yielding ~0 for Tallying and ~1 for R2L-TTB.

**Observed (real) value:** -0.7133 (var=0.0434)
**Predicted under pi_4:** -0.6833 (var=0.0781)
**Predicted under pi_2:** -0.0233 (var=0.0300)

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all 6 experiments, Theory 1 (Right-to-Left Take-The-Best) consistently and accurately predicts the observed data, whereas Theory 2 (Tallying) fails dramatically on Experiments 1, 2, 4, and 6. The observed data strongly supports the hypothesis that participants are using a lexicographic heuristic rather than an unweighted compensatory one (Tallying). However, the specific claim of Theory 1\u2014that participants search features from right to left (which corresponds to the lowest objective validities in these designs)\u2014is highly counterintuitive, yet it fits the data perfectly. Theory 2 is degenerate and should be replaced with a stronger, more normative competitor to test if the right-to-left bias is truly the best explanation.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a standard Take-The-Best (TTB) theory where subjects search cues in descending order of their objective validities (which corresponds to Left-to-Right in these experiments). This will serve as a strong normative baseline against the empirical success of the Right-to-Left TTB theory, allowing us to definitively arbitrate whether participants are following a rational validity-based search or a quirky layout-driven recency bias."
