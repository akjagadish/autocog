# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_6`).

Replace Theory 2 with a new theory that acknowledges the primacy of the rightmost features but introduces a different fallback mechanism than strict R2L-TTB. For instance, propose a 'Rightmost-Cue plus Tallying' theory: people first check the rightmost cue; if it discriminates, they use it. If it ties, instead of moving strictly one-by-one to the left (like R2L-TTB), they simply tally the remaining cues to make a quick decision. This provides a simpler cognitive mechanism for ties than sequential R2L evaluation and might better capture variance in trials where the rightmost cue ties.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Rightmost-Cue plus Tallying: Decision-makers exhibit a strong spatial or recency bias, prioritizing the rightmost feature. They first evaluate the options based solely on this rightmost cue. If it discriminates, the favored option is chosen. If it ties, they fall back to a cognitively simpler strategy than sequential cue-checking: they tally the remaining cues, counting how many favor each option, and choose the one with the higher tally. If the tally also ties, they guess. Decisions are subject to softmax response noise and a constant lapse rate, but choices are largely deterministic.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    n_features = stim.shape[1]
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    rm_idx = n_features - 1
    
    if a[rm_idx] > b[rm_idx]:
        scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif b[rm_idx] > a[rm_idx]:
        scores = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        # Tally remaining cues
        a_rem = a[:rm_idx]
        b_rem = b[:rm_idx]
        a_tally = np.sum(a_rem > b_rem)
        b_tally = np.sum(b_rem > a_rem)
        
        if a_tally > b_tally:
            scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
        elif b_tally > a_tally:
            scores = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
        else:
            scores = np.array([0.0, 0.0])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(2) / 2.0)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- beta: [2.0, 10.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, the predict and policy logic of the 'Rightmost-Cue plus Tallying' heuristic are kept completely intact. To fix the severe misfit on Experiment 2 where excessive noise washed out the deterministic outcomes, the parameter ranges for beta and epsilon are tightened (beta: [2.0, 10.0] and epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]). This enforces more deterministic behavior while preserving the accepted cognitive mechanism.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0863 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1498 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0863.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The 'Rightmost-Cue plus Tallying' candidate was accepted and achieved a new best aggregate loss, showing that a simplified fallback mechanism effectively captures variance in many experiments. However, it severely misfits Experiment 2 (Candidate: 0.6800 vs Real: 0.2067). In Experiment 2's target trials, the rightmost cue ties, triggering the tallying fallback. The remaining cues also tie in tally, resulting in a 50/50 guess in the model. The high simulated value (0.6800) indicates that low beta values or high epsilon values are washing out the deterministic choices, pulling the aggregate metric too far toward random guessing.
Rationale: While the prescribed mechanism family (Rightmost-Cue + Tallying) is working well overall and was accepted, the parameter ranges allow for too much noise, causing a severe miss on Experiment 2. Regenerate the model keeping the exact same predict and policy logic, but tighten the parameter ranges to force more deterministic behavior: increase the minimum for `beta` (e.g., [2.0, 10.0]) and restrict `epsilon` to a lower ceiling (e.g., [0.0, 0.2]). This minor adjustment will preserve the accepted base while sharpening the decision probabilities.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0863 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1498 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The attempt to improve the fit on Experiment 2 by tightening the parameter ranges (reducing noise) was REJECTED by the gate, as it severely degraded performance on Experiments 1 and 4. The model needs the wider noise parameters to capture the empirical variance correctly. In Experiment 2, the current tallying mechanism (counting strict advantages, i.e., sum(A > B)) results in a tie for the target trials, leading to a 50/50 guess which overestimates the metric. We need to explore a slight variation of the tallying fallback while restoring the original noise flexibility.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since tightening the parameters worsened the overall fit, revert to wider parameter ranges (e.g., beta: [0.1, 5.0], epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]) to allow the model to capture behavioral noise. To improve the Rightmost-Cue + Tallying mechanism without leaving the prescribed family, adjust how the tallying is computed: instead of counting how many remaining cues strictly favor each option (a_rem > b_rem), simply sum the remaining cues for each option (sum(a_rem) vs sum(b_rem)) and compare the totals. If they still tie, fall back to a random guess. This maintains the simple cognitive fallback while potentially resolving ties differently."
