# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People are modeled as running three classic heuristics in parallel — Take The Best (one-reason, top-validity cue), Tallying (count of feature-wise wins), and Weighted Additive (validity-weighted sum) — reading off the single option each heuristic deterministically prefers, and then leaning toward whichever option the majority of the three did NOT prefer. With three binary voters at least two always agree, so a majority option always exists; the model targets its complement. Response noise enters only at the final, ensemble level: a softmax over the binary "flipped-majority" score with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options. The individual heuristics contribute only their hard preference (their argmax) to the vote — they carry no internal noise — so beta and epsilon describe noise in the contrarian response itself, not in the constituent heuristics.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** The advocated theory posits a 'flipped-majority' ensemble in which the decision-maker computes the deterministic preferences of Tallying, Take The Best (TTB), and Weighted Additive (WADD), and then deliberately chooses the option that the majority of these heuristics do NOT prefer. The competing theory posits a standard Tallying heuristic with softmax noise. To maximally dissociate these theories, we design trials where Tallying has a strict preference for one option, and the majority of the three heuristics (often including Tallying itself) also agree on that same option. Consequently, the advocated theory will strongly predict choosing the exact opposite of what the competing Tallying theory predicts.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Calculates the proportion of choices that align with the Tallying heuristic (choosing the option with more feature-wise wins). By design, the experimental trials pit the Tallying heuristic's deterministic preference against the Flipped-Majority prediction. The Tallying theory will score highly on this metric (near 1.0, minus noise), whereas the Advocated Flipped-Majority theory will score very poorly (near 0.0, plus noise).

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.7, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=4):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** We design trials where the Advocated Theory (Tallying) either strongly prefers one option or predicts indifference, while the Competing Theory (Anti-majority ensemble) predicts the exact opposite. By pitting a single highly valid cue against multiple lower-validity cues, we create scenarios where Tallying prefers the option with more wins, whereas Take The Best (TTB) prefers the option with the single best cue. When Weighted Additive (WADD) aligns with Tallying, the majority vote aligns with Tallying, causing the Anti-majority model to deterministically flip and choose the TTB-preferred option. This yields a strong quantitative and qualitative dissociation between the two theories.

**Computed schedule:** 4 unique pairs × 24 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates the trials where the two theories make strictly opposite deterministic predictions. Specifically, it filters for trials where one option has more positive features than the other (Trials 1 and 2). Tallying strongly prefers the option with more positive features, while the Anti-majority ensemble (dominated by the flipped majority aligning with Take The Best) strongly prefers the option with fewer features but the single highest validity cue. The metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with Tallying on these critical trials, yielding a value near 1.0 for the Advocated Theory and near 0.0 for the Competing Theory.

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Theory 1 (pi_1), which posits a 'flipped-majority' ensemble (anti-majority), accurately captures the observed data across both experiments. In Experiment 1, the observed alignment with Tallying was 0.2675, perfectly matching Theory 1's prediction of 0.2288 and strongly contradicting Theory 2's prediction of 0.8573. Similarly, in Experiment 2, the observed alignment with Tallying on unequal-sum trials was 0.2350, again matching Theory 1 (0.2308) and falsifying Theory 2 (0.8492). Subjects are systematically choosing the option with fewer positive features and lower overall cue validity, which completely invalidates the standard Tallying model (Theory 2).",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Theory 2 (Tallying) is thoroughly falsified by the data, as subjects consistently prefer the option with fewer wins and lower cue validities. Propose a brand-new theory that provides a simpler, more direct explanation for this contrarian behavior than Theory 1's complex 'flipped-majority' ensemble. For example, propose a 'Take The Worst' heuristic (relying on the least valid cue) or an 'Anti-WADD' / 'Anti-Tallying' heuristic where subjects systematically misinterpret the expert ratings (e.g., treating 0 as a better rank than 1) or deliberately choose the objectively inferior option."
