# Round 4 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People are modeled as running three classic heuristics in parallel — Take The Best (one-reason, top-validity cue), Tallying (count of feature-wise wins), and Weighted Additive (validity-weighted sum) — reading off the single option each heuristic deterministically prefers, and then leaning toward whichever option the majority of the three did NOT prefer. With three binary voters at least two always agree, so a majority option always exists; the model targets its complement. Response noise enters only at the final, ensemble level: a softmax over the binary "flipped-majority" score with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options. The individual heuristics contribute only their hard preference (their argmax) to the vote — they carry no internal noise — so beta and epsilon describe noise in the contrarian response itself, not in the constituent heuristics.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `weights`: `[(0.0, 1.0)] * n_features`

### slot 2 — `pi_6` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Strict Anti-TTB (Contrarian Lexicographic) Theory with Simple Lapse Noise

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the noise model has been simplified by removing the redundant softmax inverse temperature (`beta`). Since the core heuristic yields deterministic binary preferences (1.0 and 0.0), applying both a softmax and a lapse rate created an unidentifiable parameter space. We now directly apply a uniform lapse rate (`epsilon`) to the deterministic choice, and have widened its range to [0.0, 1.0] to give the optimizer full flexibility to capture varying levels of stochasticity across experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Anti-TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order
    cue_order = np.argsort(-validities, kind="stable").tolist()
    
    winner = None
    # Find the first discriminating cue
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            # a has 1, b has 0. Anti-TTB prefers the option with 0, which is b.
            winner = 1
            break
        elif b[j] > a[j]:
            # b has 1, a has 0. Anti-TTB prefers the option with 0, which is a.
            winner = 0
            break
            
    if winner is None:
        p_core = np.ones(2) / 2.0
    else:
        p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
```


## Replacement

### `pi_7` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Strict Anti-Tallying Theory: Decision makers employ a purely compensatory contrarian heuristic by simply counting the total number of positive features (expert endorsements) for each option and deterministically preferring the option with FEWER positive features. Softmax and lapse noise are applied only to this binary deterministic preference, meaning the magnitude of the difference in feature counts does not influence the confidence of the choice, contrasting with proportional anti-tallying models.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, we propose a 'Strict Anti-Tallying' model. Unlike the previous Anti-Tallying model (pi_3) which applied softmax directly to the raw feature counts (making the choice probability sensitive to the magnitude of the difference in tallies), this strict version deterministically assigns a binary preference to the option with fewer positive features, and only then applies softmax and lapse noise. This mirrors the binary voting mechanism of the successful Anti-Majority ensemble (pi_1) but relies on a single, simpler contrarian heuristic, serving as a strong baseline.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Strict Anti-Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Count positive features for each option
    a_count = np.sum(a)
    b_count = np.sum(b)
    
    # Deterministically prefer the option with FEWER positive features
    if a_count < b_count:
        scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif b_count < a_count:
        scores = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        scores = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over the binary deterministic scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))
