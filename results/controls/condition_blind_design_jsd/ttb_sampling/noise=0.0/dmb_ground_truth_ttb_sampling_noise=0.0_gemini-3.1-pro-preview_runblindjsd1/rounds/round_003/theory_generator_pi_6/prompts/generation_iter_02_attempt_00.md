# generation_iter_02_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Propose a 'Validity-Gated Tallying' (or Thresholded Tallying) theory. In this theory, decision-makers do not integrate all cues with precise weights, nor do they strictly follow a sequential Take-The-Best hierarchy. Instead, they establish a validity threshold. Cues with validities below this threshold are ignored as unreliable noise. For the remaining 'trusted' cues, the decision-maker simply tallies the number of positive features for each option (equal weighting) and chooses the option with the highest tally. This differs from WADD by abandoning compensatory precision, and differs from TTB by evaluating multiple trusted cues in parallel rather than sequentially.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.939)

**Description**
Two-Stage Heuristic (Hybrid TTB-Tallying over Remaining Cues): Decision makers use a bounded sequential search, initially relying on the most valid cues to discriminate between options (Take-The-Best). If the top 'k' cues fail to discriminate (i.e., they are tied), the decision maker falls back to a computationally simpler 'Tallying' strategy. However, instead of tallying all cues, they only tally the remaining unexamined cues, avoiding double-counting the cues that already tied. This provides a psychologically plausible sequential search process that blends lexicographic and tallying strategies.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.782)

**Description**
Take-The-Best (TTB) is a non-compensatory fast-and-frugal heuristic. People rank features by their subjective validity and compare options sequentially. The decision is based entirely on the first feature that discriminates between the options, ignoring all remaining features. If all features tie, the decision maker guesses randomly. Response noise is captured by a uniform lapse rate.

def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.5209 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.5901 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.5209 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Validity-Gated Tallying: Decision-makers evaluate options by establishing a subjective validity threshold. Cues with validities below this threshold are discarded as unreliable noise. The remaining trusted cues are treated equally, and the decision-maker simply tallies the number of positive features for each option across these trusted cues, choosing the option with the highest tally. If the tallies are tied, they guess randomly. This represents a boundedly rational strategy that balances the robustness of multiple cues with the cognitive simplicity of equal weighting.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Filter cues based on the validity threshold
    trusted_cues = validities >= threshold
    
    # Tally the positive features for the trusted cues
    tally_a = np.sum(a[trusted_cues])
    tally_b = np.sum(b[trusted_cues])
    
    # Determine choice probabilities based on tallies
    if tally_a > tally_b:
        p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif tally_b > tally_a:
        p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- threshold: [0.5, 1.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's guidance, this model implements the Validity-Gated Tallying theory. Instead of using precise compensatory weights (like WADD) or strictly sequential cue evaluation (like Take-The-Best), it filters cues based on a subjective validity threshold. Trusted cues are then evaluated in parallel using a simple equal-weight tallying mechanism. This captures human behavior by reflecting a heuristic that is computationally frugal yet robust enough to integrate multiple reliable pieces of information.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model implements Validity-Gated Tallying by setting a threshold for trusted cues and then tallying the positive features. However, the simulation results show poor fits on Experiments 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 compared to reference models (e.g., pi_4 and pi_5). The likely reason is that the choice mechanism relies on a strict argmax over tallies (with an epsilon lapse rate). This deterministic step function treats a tally difference of 1 exactly the same as a tally difference of 4, failing to capture the graded, probabilistic nature of human choice where larger differences in evidence lead to higher confidence.
Rationale: The model strictly follows the prescribed mechanism family but misses the empirical data because the decision rule is too rigid. Revise the `predict` function to use a softmax function over the tallies instead of a strict argmax (e.g., `exp(beta * tally) / sum(exp(beta * tallies))`). Introduce an inverse temperature parameter `beta` (e.g., range [0.1, 10.0]) to replace or complement `epsilon`. This will allow the model to produce graded probabilities that scale with the difference in tallies, better capturing human choice consistency.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5209 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.5901 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate attempted to replace the strict argmax decision rule with a softmax over tallies to capture graded choice probabilities. However, this candidate was REJECTED by the accept gate (loss increased from 0.5209 to 0.5901). The softmax approach likely smoothed out the choice probabilities too much, failing to capture the sharp, consistent preferences humans exhibit when one option clearly wins on trusted cues. The base model (argmax with a lapse rate) is much closer to the empirical data but still falls short of the target theory (pi_5).
Rationale: Since the softmax modification was rejected by the gate, you should revert to the strict argmax decision rule (which the loop will do automatically by building on the accepted base). To improve the fit within the prescribed family, keep the argmax over tallies but ensure the model handles edge cases robustly (e.g., when no cues exceed the threshold, it should default to random guessing). Additionally, try widening the `threshold` parameter range to `[0.0, 1.0]` to ensure the optimizer can explore lower thresholds if validities in some experiments are scaled differently. Stick strictly to the Validity-Gated Tallying mechanism with an epsilon lapse rate.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.5901 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

If the tallies are tied, they guess randomly. This represents a boundedly rational strategy that balances the robustness of multiple cues with the cognitive simplicity of equal weighting.",

  "rationale": "Following the critic's advice, we revert to the strict argmax decision rule which was previously accepted and performed better than the softmax approach. We expand the `threshold` parameter range to [0.0, 1.0] to allow the optimizer to explore lower thresholds, accommodating experiments where validities might be scaled differently. The edge case where no cues exceed the threshold is naturally handled by the sum yielding 0 for both options, leading to a 50/50 guess."
