# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Take The Best (Gigerenzer & Goldstein 1996).
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current
    # trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B. Cue cascade: features are consulted in order
    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )
    # Descending validity; argsort is stable so validity ties break
    # toward the earlier feature index.
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break

    if winner is None:
        # No discriminating cue — pure guess.
        return np.ones(2) / 2.0

    scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. For the
    # binary TTB score this collapses to sigmoid(beta) for the winner,
    # giving a direct mapping from beta onto the paper's flip-noise
    # levels (beta=0 ↔ 50/50; beta ≫ 1 ↔ deterministic).
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]

```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Decision-makers use a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy, evaluating each option by computing a weighted sum of its features, where the weights are directly proportional to the provided cue validities. The option with the higher weighted sum is favored. Response noise is modeled via a softmax over these weighted sums with an inverse temperature, along with a lapse rate for random guessing.

**Rationale:** In accordance with the arbiter's feedback, this implements the Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. Instead of discarding cue validities (like Tallying) or ignoring less valid cues (like Take The Best), WADD integrates all available information by weighting each feature by its validity. This compensatory mechanism is captured by taking the dot product of the feature vectors and the validity vector, then mapping the resulting scores to choice probabilities using a softmax rule with a lapse rate.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Compute weighted sum for each option
    score_a = np.dot(a, val)
    score_b = np.dot(b, val)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities

```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Decision-makers evaluate options using a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy, but their choices are subject to sequential dependencies, specifically choice inertia. The value of each option is computed as a weighted sum of its features, where weights correspond to cue validities. Additionally, a baseline bias (inertia) is added to the score of the option that was chosen in the immediately preceding trial. This reflects a psychological tendency to repeat previous actions (or avoid them, if inertia is negative). Choice probabilities are generated via a softmax function with an inverse temperature, along with a lapse rate for random guessing.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice to strengthen the lag-1 sequential effect without introducing multi-trial complexity (which was rejected), the parameter ranges for `inertia` and `beta` have been widened to [-20.0, 20.0] and [0.1, 50.0], respectively. This allows the model to rely more heavily on the previous choice and produce sharper transitions, helping to better capture the strong short-lived sequential dependence observed in the human data.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `inertia`: `[-20.0, 20.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Compute weighted sum for each option
    score_a = np.dot(a, val)
    score_b = np.dot(b, val)
    
    # Incorporate choice inertia from the previous trial
    inertia = float(parameters["inertia"])
    if history and "response" in history and len(history["response"]) > 0:
        prev_resp = history["response"][-1]
        if prev_resp == 0:
            score_a += inertia
        elif prev_resp == 1:
            score_b += inertia
            
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```
