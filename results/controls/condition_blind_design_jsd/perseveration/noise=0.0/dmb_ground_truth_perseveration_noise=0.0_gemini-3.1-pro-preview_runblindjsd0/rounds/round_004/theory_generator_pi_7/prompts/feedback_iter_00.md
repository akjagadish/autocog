# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a brand-new theory based on an Additive Difference Model with Probabilistic Feature Comparison. Instead of calculating absolute values for each option (as in WADD) or strictly applying a lexicographic stopping rule (as in TTB), assume decision-makers compare options attribute-by-attribute. The differences on each attribute are weighted non-linearly by their stated validities and accumulated into a relative evidence signal. Introduce a stochastic element where attention to features is proportional to their validities, and use a softmax function over the accumulated differences with a lapse rate to account for baseline noise.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Probabilistic Attention Additive Difference Model: Decision-makers compare options attribute-by-attribute rather than computing holistic absolute values. The relative evidence for each option is accumulated from the feature differences. However, the accumulation is doubly weighted: first, by the non-linear log-odds of the feature's validity, reflecting its objective diagnosticity; and second, by a stochastic attention mechanism where the probability of attending to a feature scales with its validity. This results in an expected evidence score that heavily discounts low-validity features. The final choice is generated via a softmax over the accumulated relative evidence, incorporating choice inertia from the previous trial and a baseline lapse rate for attentional lapses.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be of shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]

    log_odds = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    
    # Stochastic attention: probability of attending scales with validity
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    attention = val_clipped ** gamma
    
    # Expected effective weights for the accumulated difference
    effective_weights = attention * log_odds
    
    scores = np.zeros(2)
    # Accumulate relative evidence attribute-by-attribute
    scores[0] = np.sum((a > b) * effective_weights)
    scores[1] = np.sum((b > a) * effective_weights)

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    p_final = (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
    
    return p_final


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- inertia: [-5.0, 5.0]
- gamma: [0.1, 5.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory departs from strict lexicographic stopping (like TTB) and holistic valuation (like WADD). Instead, it uses an Additive Difference approach where features are compared one-by-one. It incorporates a non-linear weighting of the differences using log-odds, and introduces a probabilistic attention mechanism where the likelihood of considering a feature is proportional to its validity (parameterized by gamma). The expected evidence is then passed through a softmax function with choice inertia and a lapse rate, bridging the gap between compensatory and non-compensatory heuristics by heavily discounting less diagnostic cues while still allowing them to contribute probabilistically.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.8925 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.8925.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate successfully implements the Probabilistic Attention Additive Difference Model prescribed by the arbiter. The model accumulates relative evidence using an attribute-by-attribute comparison weighted by a non-linear diagnosticity term (log-odds of validity) and a stochastic attention mechanism (probability scaling with validity). The results are highly encouraging: the candidate achieves excellent fits on Experiments 8 and 10 (JSDs of 0.0040 and 0.0032), drastically outperforming several baseline theories on these datasets. While its fits on Experiments 1-7 are slightly higher than some older models, the overall aggregate loss has improved and reached a new running-best.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate faithfully incorporates the mechanism family requested by the arbiter and successfully reduces the aggregate loss to a new best. Since it effectively captures behavior across the target experiments without obvious conceptual bugs, the current theory should be kept for the next phase."
