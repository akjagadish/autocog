# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Decision makers exhibit strategy variability, probabilistic alternating between a simple heuristic and a compensatory strategy. Specifically, subjects use a Strategy Mixture of Tallying (counting the number of positive cues for each option, ignoring cue validities) and Weighted Additive (WADD, computing a compensatory score based on log-odds of cue validities). This mixture allows the model to capture both fast, unweighted evidence accumulation and more deliberative, validity-weighted integration on different trials.

**Rationale:** The arbiter noted that pure TTB is too rigid and suggested exploring Tallying or a Strategy Mixture. Given that Tallying alone is a strong baseline (as seen in its leaderboard performance), a mixture model that probabilistically alternates between Tallying (simple cue counting) and WADD (compensatory validity-weighted integration) provides a flexible and structurally distinct hypothesis. This model allows for individual differences in strategy reliance via the w_mix parameter, capturing behavior that is sometimes heuristic and sometimes deliberative.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `w_mix`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

        raise ValueError("Strategy Mixture expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy computes a compensatory score for each option by summing its feature values weighted by the log-odds of their respective cue validities. Choice is probabilistically determined by a softmax over these aggregated scores, allowing multiple weak cues to override a single strong cue.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's suggestion, the Weighted Additive (WADD) model evaluates options compensatorily. Unlike TTB (which stops at the first cue) or Tallying (which weights all cues equally), WADD aggregates all available cues, weighting each by its log-odds validity. This captures behavior where multiple weaker cues can jointly override a single stronger cue, which is often observed in decision-making under uncertainty.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Transform validities to log-odds weights, clipping to avoid log(0) or division by zero
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)
    weights = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    
    # Calculate weighted sum for each option
    scores = np.dot(stim, weights)
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over scores
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**

    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)

## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Choice-Inertia Weighted Additive Model: Decision makers evaluate options using a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy, but their final valuation is biased by their choice on the immediately preceding trial. This history-dependent inertia acts as an autoregressive bias on the chosen response side (e.g., a motor or spatial bias), allowing the model to capture sequential dependencies such as the tendency to repeat or alternate responses independently of the option features.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's feedback, this theory introduces a sequential dependence mechanism ('Choice Inertia') built on top of a compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) base. By adding a history-dependent bias parameter (`inertia`) to the score of the option corresponding to the previously chosen side, the model can capture trial-to-trial autocorrelations commonly observed in human data (e.g., motor repetition or alternation biases). This mechanistic addition directly targets the failure of previous memoryless models to account for sequential effects in the experimental metric.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `inertia`: `[-5.0, 5.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be of shape (2, n_features).")
        
    # WADD base valuation
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)

    scores = np.dot(stim, weights)
    
    # Add choice inertia from the previous trial
    if history and "response" in history and len(history["response"]) > 0:
        last_choice = int(history["response"][-1])
