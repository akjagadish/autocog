# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Take The Best (Gigerenzer & Goldstein 1996).
    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current
    # trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B. Cue cascade: features are consulted in order
    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != n_features:
        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )
    # Descending validity; argsort is stable so validity ties break
    # toward the earlier feature index.
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break

    if winner is None:
        # No discriminating cue — pure guess.
        return np.ones(2) / 2.0

    scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. For the
    # binary TTB score this collapses to sigmoid(beta) for the winner,
    # giving a direct mapping from beta onto the paper's flip-noise
    # levels (beta=0 ↔ 50/50; beta ≫ 1 ↔ deterministic).
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People make decisions using a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. Instead of relying on a single discriminating cue (Take The Best) or treating all cues equally (Tallying), decision makers compute a comprehensive value for each option by summing its feature values weighted by their respective cue validities. The option with the higher total weighted value is favored. This compensatory approach allows multiple weak cues to outweigh a single strong cue, reflecting a more exhaustive integration of available information. Choice stochasticity is modeled via a softmax over the weighted sums with an inverse temperature parameter (beta), along with an independent lapse rate (epsilon) for random guessing.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's recommendation, this theory implements the Weighted Additive (WADD) heuristic. Unlike Tallying (which ignores cue validities) and Take The Best (which ignores all but the first discriminating cue), WADD integrates all available information by weighting each feature by its validity. This allows for compensatory decision-making where multiple weak cues can overcome a single strong one. The model computes the weighted sum for each option and uses a softmax function with a lapse rate to produce choice probabilities, capturing both the compensatory nature of the strategy and the inherent noise in human decision-making.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Compute the weighted sum of features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a * validities)
    score_b = np.sum(b * validities)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Convert scores to probabilities using a numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()

## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Tallying (Equal Weights) Theory: Decision-makers evaluate options by simply counting the total number of positive features each option possesses, completely ignoring the continuous cue validities. This frugal, compensatory heuristic assumes all features are equally important. Choice probabilities are generated via a softmax function over these unweighted feature counts, with an added lapse rate for random guessing.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's recommendation, this theory implements the Tallying (Equal Weights) heuristic. Instead of relying on a single cue (like Take The Best) or weighting features by their validities (like WADD), the decision-maker simply counts the number of positive features for each option. This is formalized by taking the unweighted sum of the binary feature vectors for each option. A softmax rule with inverse temperature (beta) translates the difference in tallies into choice probabilities, while a lapse rate (epsilon) accounts for random guessing.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Tallying: count the number of positive features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a)
    score_b = np.sum(b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Convert scores to probabilities using a numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```
