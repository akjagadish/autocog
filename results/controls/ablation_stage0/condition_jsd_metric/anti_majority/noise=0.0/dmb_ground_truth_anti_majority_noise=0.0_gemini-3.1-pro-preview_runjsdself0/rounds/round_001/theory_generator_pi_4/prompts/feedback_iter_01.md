# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Propose a unified sequential evidence accumulation theory (e.g., a threshold model). In this theory, subjects consult cues in order of validity and accumulate evidence (e.g., the log-odds weights of the discriminating cues). After each cue, if the accumulated evidence difference between the two options exceeds a certain internal threshold, the subject stops and makes a choice. If the threshold is low, this model perfectly mimics Take The Best (stopping at the first discriminating cue). If the threshold is high, it mimics the Weighted Additive model (integrating all available cues). This single mechanism can naturally capture the intermediate and context-dependent behavior observed across all experiments.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People make decisions by sequentially accumulating evidence from cues in order of their validity. Evidence is weighted by the log-odds of each cue's validity. The accumulation stops and a choice is made as soon as the absolute difference in accumulated evidence between the two options exceeds an internal threshold, which is scaled relative to the maximum possible evidence in the environment. A low threshold leads to frugal 'Take The Best' behavior, while a high threshold leads to compensatory 'Weighted Additive' behavior. This unified mechanism accounts for varying degrees of cue integration depending on task context and individual differences.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Monotonic transformation of validities to log-odds
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)
    weights = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    
    # Cues are consulted in descending order of validity
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
    
    # Scale threshold relative to the maximum possible evidence (sum of weights)
    threshold_param = float(parameters["threshold"])
    scaled_threshold = threshold_param * np.sum(weights)
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    score_a = 0.0
    score_b = 0.0
    
    # Sequential evidence accumulation
    for j in cue_order:
        score_a += weights[j] * a[j]
        score_b += weights[j] * b[j]
        diff = abs(score_a - score_b)
        # Stop if the accumulated difference exceeds the scaled threshold
        if diff >= scaled_threshold and diff > 1e-6:
            break

    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = len(scores)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- threshold: [0.0, 5.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, the threshold is now scaled relative to the maximum possible evidence (the sum of the log-odds weights). This normalization ensures that the threshold parameter operates consistently across different experiments and validity distributions, representing a fraction of the total possible evidence difference. The threshold parameter range is adjusted to [0.0, 5.0], where values >= 1.0 guarantee full integration (Weighted Additive) and values near 0.0 yield Take The Best behavior. This minimal edit preserves the core sequential accumulation mechanism while improving the model's ability to capture subtle choice probability variations in Experiments 2 and 4.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3200 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3352 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3200.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory, which implements a sequential evidence accumulation model with a stopping threshold, was accepted and shows an overall improvement. It captures the general patterns in Experiments 1 and 3 reasonably well. However, it severely misses the empirical target for Experiment 4 (simulated 0.0080 vs. real 0.2052) and underestimates the metric for Experiment 2 (simulated 0.1071 vs. real 0.1803). The threshold mechanism is a solid bridge between Take The Best and Weighted Additive, but the current parameterization of the threshold or the softmax temperature (beta) seems to prevent it from matching the variance and specific choice probabilities in Experiments 2 and 4.
Rationale: While the unified threshold mechanism is the correct family (and was accepted), its fit on Experiment 4 needs significant improvement. Please refine the threshold and scaling parameters. Consider normalizing the accumulated log-odds weights or scaling the threshold relative to the maximum possible evidence so that the threshold parameter is more robust across different validity distributions. Additionally, tightening the `threshold` range (e.g., [0.0, 5.0]) and adjusting the `beta` range might help the model better capture the subtle choice probability variations seen in Experiments 2 and 4.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3200 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3352 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate was rejected by the gate because the loss increased. Scaling the threshold by the sum of the weights did not improve the fit, particularly in Experiment 4 where the model's JSD to the reference probabilities (0.0053) remains drastically lower than the human data's JSD (0.2052), and Experiment 2 where it still underestimates the target. The scaling approach likely forced the threshold to be too rigid across different cue environments.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since scaling the threshold by the sum of log-odds weights was rejected by the gate, we should abandon that scaling. Instead, return to an unscaled threshold but change how evidence is weighted: use simple differences in validities (e.g., `weight = validity - 0.5`) rather than log-odds, which can create extreme values and overly sharp evidence accumulation. Additionally, allow a higher upper bound on the temperature parameter `beta` and `epsilon` to give the model more flexibility to match the noise levels in the human data, which should help raise the JSD in Experiments 2 and 4 to match the empirical targets."
