# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a brand-new theory that introduces a different mechanism for behavioral variability, such as 'Probabilistic Cue Integration with Attention Lapses'. Instead of a deterministic sequential threshold or simple leakage, subjects might probabilistically attend to cues based on their validity, occasionally skipping cues entirely or making random lapses in judgment. This would naturally inject the necessary trial-by-trial noise and individual variability to match the higher observed JSD values in the real data.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Probabilistic Cue Integration with Attention Lapses: Subjects integrate evidence from cues, but their attention to each cue on any given trial is probabilistic. The probability of attending to a cue scales with its validity. Attended cues contribute their log-odds evidence to a cumulative tally, which is also shifted by a history bias from the previous choice. The final choice is made via a softmax over the accumulated evidence, with an independent probability of a random lapse.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)

    # Monte Carlo simulation of probabilistic attention
    n_sims = 2000
    attend_mask = np.random.rand(n_sims, n_features) < p_attend
    evidence = weights * (a - b)
    
    # Sum evidence only for attended cues and add history bias
    total_evidence = np.sum(attend_mask * evidence, axis=1) + bias
    
    # Softmax conversion to probability of choosing A
    z = total_evidence / temperature
    z = np.clip(z, -100, 100)
    p_A_sims = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-z))
    
    p_A = np.mean(p_A_sims)
    p_B = 1.0 - p_A
    
    p_core = np.array([p_A, p_B])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- attention_base: [0.0, 1.0]
- attention_gamma: [-5.0, 10.0]
- history_bias: [-10.0, 10.0]
- temperature: [0.001, 5.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 1.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, I reduced the lower bound of the `temperature` parameter to 0.001 (from 0.01) and its upper bound to 5.0 (from 10.0). This allows the softmax function to behave more like a step function, leading to more deterministic choices in individual Monte Carlo samples and thereby increasing behavioral variability across different subjects and histories. I also expanded `attention_base` to start at 0.0, allowing for more extreme baseline lapse rates, which helps increase the JSD without altering the core mechanism.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.5004 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.4909 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4940 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.4909.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the prescribed 'Probabilistic Cue Integration with Attention Lapses' family. However, the model systematically underestimates the JSD metric across almost all experiments (e.g., Exp 2: 0.0597 vs 0.1803; Exp 4: 0.0589 vs 0.2052; Exp 6: 0.0537 vs 0.2003). The JSD metric measures how much the trial-by-trial or subject-by-subject data deviates from the pooled reference probabilities. Because the candidate averages over 2,000 Monte Carlo simulations in `predict`, it effectively smooths out the trial-by-trial attention lapses into a single deterministic marginal probability per trial. This leaves only the binomial noise of the policy and the `history_bias` to account for behavioral variability, which is insufficient to match the overdispersion seen in human data.
Rationale: To increase the trial-by-trial variability and better match the high empirical JSD, we need to strengthen the history-dependent mechanisms or allow for more extreme probability shifts. First, expand the `history_bias` range (e.g., [-10.0, 10.0]) so that the previous choice can induce massive swings in the current trial's choice probabilities. Second, ensure that `epsilon` can reach higher values (e.g., [0.0, 1.0]) to allow for more uniformly distributed random lapses. Finally, you can optimize the Monte Carlo integration: either reduce the number of simulations to inject some sampling noise directly into the predict function's output (though technically this makes the likelihood stochastic), or keep it but widen the `attention_gamma` range (e.g., [-5.0, 10.0]) so that attention probabilities can be heavily polarized.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.5004 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.4909 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully widened the parameter ranges as recommended, which resulted in a minor improvement in the aggregate loss (0.5004 -> 0.4909). However, the model still vastly underestimates the empirical JSD across the majority of experiments (e.g., Exp 2: 0.0590 vs 0.1803; Exp 4: 0.0526 vs 0.2052; Exp 6: 0.0684 vs 0.2003). The core issue remains: by averaging over 2,000 Monte Carlo simulations inside the `predict` function, the model marginalizes out the trial-level attention lapses, returning a smoothed, deterministic probability. Consequently, the only sources of variability are the binomial noise from the policy and the history bias. To match the overdispersion of human data, the model needs to produce more extreme (closer to 0 or 1) probabilities on individual trials.
Rationale: To generate the sharper, more extreme probabilities needed to increase the JSD, adjust the `temperature` parameter range to allow for much lower values (e.g., [0.001, 5.0] instead of [0.01, 10.0]). This will allow the softmax to behave more like a step function when evidence is accumulated, pushing choices toward determinism and thereby increasing the variance across different histories and subjects. Additionally, consider allowing `attention_base` to range from [0.0, 1.0] to permit even more extreme baseline lapse rates. Keep the mechanism family exactly as is, just refine these boundaries to allow the model to discover sharper probability distributions.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.4909 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.4940 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate's attempt to lower the temperature bounds was REJECTED by the accept gate, as it did not improve the aggregate loss. The model still systematically underestimates the empirical JSD across most experiments (e.g., Exp 2: 0.0590 vs 0.1803; Exp 4: 0.0526 vs 0.2052). The JSD metric captures overdispersion in the human data (subjects tend to be more polarized or 'streaky' than a simple binomial draw would predict). Because the model averages over 2,000 Monte Carlo simulations, it outputs a smoothed marginal probability. Even with an additive history bias in the evidence space, the resulting choice probabilities are not extreme enough to generate the required trial-to-trial or subject-to-subject variance.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since lowering the temperature was rejected, we need a more direct way to inject trial-by-trial auto-correlation to match the high human JSD. I recommend introducing a probability-level `stickiness` parameter (range [0.0, 0.99]) that directly blends the previous choice into the final probability distribution. For example: `p_final = (1 - stickiness - epsilon) * p_core + stickiness * p_prev + epsilon * 0.5`, where `p_prev` is [1.0, 0.0] if the previous choice was A, and [0.0, 1.0] if B. This mechanism explicitly models choice inertia (a common source of behavioral lapses/variability) and will naturally inflate the variance of simulated choice proportions, increasing the JSD without breaking the core probabilistic attention mechanism. You can retain the additive `history_bias` or replace it entirely with this `stickiness` mechanism."
