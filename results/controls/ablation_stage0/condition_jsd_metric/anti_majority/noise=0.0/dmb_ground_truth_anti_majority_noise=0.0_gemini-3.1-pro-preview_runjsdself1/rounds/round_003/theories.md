# Round 3 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### slot 2 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Decision-makers use a bounded evidence accumulation process that integrates sequential dependencies. They default to a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) but smoothly transition to a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive) when opposing evidence exceeds a soft threshold. Furthermore, choices are subject to sequential dependencies: the baseline preference for an option is dynamically adjusted based on the previous trial's choice, capturing choice inertia or auto-correlation. This moving baseline influences the final decision probabilities alongside the strategy-specific evidence.

**Rationale:** The new theory directly implements the arbiter's suggestion to incorporate sequential dependencies by adding a choice inertia mechanism alongside the bounded evidence accumulation process (soft compensatory check). The evaluation metric computes JSD conditioned on the previous trial's response, implying that the history of choices influences the current choice probabilities. By adding a dynamic baseline shift (`inertia`) to the logits of the previously chosen option, the model naturally produces auto-correlation in choices, improving its ability to match the conditional JSD metrics across experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `threshold`: `[0.0, 10.0]`
  - `k`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `beta_ttb`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `beta_wadd`: `[0.1, 20.0]`

  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Probabilistic Evidence Accumulation with Baseline Evidence: Decision-makers sample cues probabilistically proportional to their log-odds validities. Each sampled cue casts a vote for the option it favors, and decision-makers also possess a baseline level of prior evidence for both options. The process continues until a relative evidence threshold is reached, producing compensatory behavior and graded choice probabilities based on the relative accumulated evidence. The inclusion of baseline evidence smooths out extreme probability predictions and naturally handles cases where no cues favor an option.

**Rationale:** Building on the accepted base from iteration 1, we retain the log-odds validities and the power-law choice rule. Following the critic's advice, we introduce a new baseline evidence parameter `c` added to both options' accumulated evidence before applying the power-law rule. This completely eliminates the need for hardcoded zero-evidence branches and smoothly regularizes extreme probability predictions when one option has little to no evidence, increasing the robustness of the Probabilistic Evidence Accumulation model.

**Parameters:**
  - `theta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `c`: `[0.01, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
