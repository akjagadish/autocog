# generation_iter_02_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Propose a new theory based on Decision Field Theory (DFT) or a Leaky Competing Accumulator (LCA) framework, incorporating sequential dependencies and dynamic attention switching between features. Unlike Theory 1's static proportional sampling and Theory 2's deterministic TTB-to-WADD threshold, this new theory should assume that decision-makers dynamically shift their attention between cues over time. The preference state is updated via a leaky accumulator with lateral inhibition, and the starting point of the accumulation is biased by the previous trial's choice (inertia). This naturally captures both sequential effects and graded compensatory behavior while providing a fundamentally different mechanism than soft strategy switching.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.434)

**Description**
People evaluate options by integrating all available feature information in a compensatory manner. According to the Weighted Additive (WADD) model, decision-makers compute a global subjective value for each option by summing its feature values, weighted by the log-odds of each feature's validity. Unlike non-compensatory heuristics like Take The Best, WADD allows multiple weak cues to outweigh a single strong cue. Choice probabilities are then derived by passing these weighted sums through a softmax function, subject to a baseline lapse rate.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.424)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.413)

**Description**
Take The Best with Soft Compensatory Check: Decision-makers default to a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) by relying on the most valid discriminating cue. However, instead of a deterministic shift, if the combined evidence (sum of log-odds weights) from cues opposing this initial choice grows, the probability of switching to a fully compensatory integration strategy (Weighted Additive) increases smoothly. This is modeled via a logistic function centered on a subject-specific evidence threshold, allowing for graded, conflict-driven transitions between strategies.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.4836 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.4380 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.4380 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Decision-makers evaluate options using a Leaky Competing Accumulator (LCA) process with dynamic attention switching. Attention deterministically shifts between features in decreasing order of their validity over a sequence of time steps. At each step, the attended feature provides evidence that updates a preference state for each option. These preference states are subject to leakage (decay of old information) and lateral inhibition (strong evidence for one option suppresses the other). Furthermore, the starting state of the accumulators is biased by the previous trial's choice, creating a sequential inertia effect. The final choice is made by passing the accumulated evidence through a softmax function.

- lambda_leak: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma_inhibition: [0.0, 0.5]
- inertia: [0.0, 2.0]
- num_steps: [1.0, 20.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the critic's advice, I reduced the upper bounds on 'inertia' (from 5.0 to 2.0), 'lambda_leak' (from 1.0 to 0.5), and 'gamma_inhibition' (from 1.0 to 0.5) to prevent extreme saturation and over-determination in the accumulators. I also changed 'num_steps' to a continuous range [1.0, 20.0] (cast to int in the predict function) to allow the model to capture a wider variety of deterministic visual scanning lengths, from very fast TTB-like single steps to longer WADD-like multi-step accumulations. This minimal edit aims to improve fits on Experiments 4 and 8 by providing more graded parameter spaces.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the LCA framework with dynamic deterministic attention and sequential inertia, as prescribed by the arbiter. The model has been ACCEPTED by the gate, improving the overall loss to 0.4836. However, it still significantly under-predicts the divergence in Experiments 4 (real=0.2270, cand=0.0405) and 8 (real=0.2264, cand=0.0146). This suggests that the sequential inertia or the evidence accumulation process might be producing overly deterministic or overly uniform choices compared to human data, likely due to extreme values in the unconstrained parameter ranges.
Rationale: To better capture the variance in Experiments 4 and 8 while staying within the prescribed deterministic-attention LCA family, tighten the parameter ranges to prevent extreme saturation. Specifically: 1) restrict `inertia` to [0.0, 2.0] (down from 5.0) so the previous choice biases but doesn't completely dominate the new accumulation; 2) restrict `lambda_leak` and `gamma_inhibition` to [0.0, 0.5] to prevent the accumulators from zeroing out too aggressively; 3) allow `num_steps` to take on a wider set of integers (e.g., [1, 20]) to capture both very fast (TTB-like) and very slow (WADD-like) deterministic visual scanning.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4836 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.4380 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully improved the fit (loss decreased from 0.4836 to 0.4380) by following the previous advice to tighten the bounds on inertia, leak, and inhibition, and by widening the steps range. However, the model still significantly under-predicts the divergence from the reference probabilities in Experiments 4 (real=0.2270, cand=0.0686), 6 (real=0.1472, cand=0.0108), and 8 (real=0.2264, cand=0.0094). A lower JSD in the candidate compared to the real data means the candidate is behaving too similarly to the reference probabilities (which often reflect a baseline strategy like WADD or TTB) and failing to capture the extent of human deviations.
Rationale: To help the model deviate more appropriately from the baseline reference probabilities and better match the high JSD in Experiments 4, 6, and 8, we should introduce the possibility of alternation bias (negative inertia) and prevent the softmax from becoming overly deterministic. Change the `inertia` range to [-1.0, 2.0] to allow the model to capture both sequential repetition and alternation. Additionally, restrict the upper bound of `beta` to 10.0 (i.e., `[0.1, 10.0]`) to prevent the model from collapsing into purely deterministic choice distributions that artificially align too well with deterministic reference strategies.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.4380 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
