# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Since the fully compensatory WADD model (THEORY 2) has been empirically defeated by the lexicographic TTB heuristic across multiple experiments, THEORY 2 should be completely replaced by another boundedly rational or heuristic-based theory. A strong competitor to strict TTB would be the Tallying heuristic (Unit-Weight Additive Model), which simply counts the number of positive features for each option while ignoring their validities. Alternatively, a Probabilistic Take-The-Best model, where the feature search order is stochastic but biased by validity (rather than strictly deterministic), could serve as a highly competitive alternative to account for the noise and slight deviations from strict TTB seen in the data.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB): Decision-makers search through features sequentially to find the first one that discriminates between options. However, rather than searching in a strict deterministic order based on validities, the search order is stochastic. Features are sampled with probabilities proportional to an exponential function of their validities, allowing for noise and slight deviations from strict TTB. The search stops at the first discriminating feature.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Find discriminating features
    diff = a - b
    D = diff != 0
    
    if not np.any(D):
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    else:
        # Under a Plackett-Luce sequential sampling model where items are sampled 
        # proportional to w_i, the probability that a specific item in D is sampled 
        # *first* among all items in D is exactly w_i / sum(w_j for j in D).
        v_D = validities[D]
        
        # Max-subtraction for numerical stability
        w = np.exp(gamma * (v_D - np.max(v_D)))
        w_sum = np.sum(w)
        
        # Probability of choosing A is the sum of weights of features favoring A, divided by w_sum
        p_A = np.sum(w[diff[D] > 0]) / w_sum
        p_B = np.sum(w[diff[D] < 0]) / w_sum
        p_core = np.array([p_A, p_B])
        
    n_opts = 2
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- gamma: [0.0, 50.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's suggestion, this theory instantiates a Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB) model. Instead of a strictly deterministic search order, the decision-maker samples features sequentially without replacement, with probabilities proportional to an exponential function of their validities (controlled by a sensitivity parameter `gamma`). The search stops at the first discriminating feature. Mathematically, by the properties of the Plackett-Luce choice model, the probability that a specific discriminating feature is encountered *first* among all discriminating features is exactly proportional to its selection weight. This allows us to compute the exact choice probabilities analytically without simulating the sequential search. The model elegantly interpolates between Tallying on discriminating features (when gamma = 0) and strict TTB (when gamma is large), thus directly addressing the arbiter's recommendations while maintaining mathematical tractability.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2746 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2746.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate model successfully implements the Probabilistic Take-The-Best (PTTB) heuristic using an elegant analytical formulation based on Plackett-Luce choice probabilities. This perfectly aligns with the arbiter's recommendation to replace the fully compensatory WADD model with a heuristic that bridges Tallying and strict TTB. The model's aggregate loss significantly improved and the candidate was accepted by the programmatic gate. Across the eight experiments, the simulated JSD metrics are much closer to the human data than the previous fully compensatory models, effectively capturing the varying degrees of noise and validity-dependence in human sequential search.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate theory perfectly implements the arbiter's recommendation within the prescribed mechanism family. The analytical solution using max-subtracted softmax weights over discriminating features is mathematically robust, computationally efficient, and conceptually faithful to the PTTB heuristic. The parameter ranges (gamma up to 50, epsilon up to 0.5) provide enough flexibility to fit both near-deterministic TTB behavior and noisy Tallying behavior. Since the candidate was accepted and the implementation is sound, we should retain it as the new baseline."
