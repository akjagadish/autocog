# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a classic Weighted Additive (WADD) model as the new Theory 2. Unlike TTB which stops at the first discriminating cue, WADD integrates all features by computing a weighted sum of the cues for each option, using the cue validities (or a transformation of them, like log-odds) as weights. Choice probabilities are then generated via a softmax function over the weighted sums. This will provide a strong, fully compensatory baseline to rigorously test whether subjects are truly non-compensatory (as TTB suggests) or if they are integrating all information.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Weighted Additive (WADD) model with Log-Odds Weights: Decision makers integrate all available information by computing a fully compensatory weighted sum of the features for each option. To properly scale the importance of each cue, objective validities (probabilities) are transformed into log-odds. This ensures that non-predictive cues (validity = 0.5) receive a weight of zero and do not distort the evaluation. The option with the higher weighted sum is favored, with choice probabilities generated via a softmax function to account for decision noise, alongside a uniform lapse rate for random errors.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Transform validities to log-odds for proper weighting
    # Clip to avoid log(0) or division by zero
    v_clipped = np.clip(validities, 1e-5, 1.0 - 1e-5)
    weights = np.log(v_clipped / (1.0 - v_clipped))
    
    # WADD: compute the weighted sum of features for each option
    scores = stim @ weights
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Blend with uniform lapse rate
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.001, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, the raw validities are now transformed into log-odds before computing the weighted sum. This is a crucial modification because raw validities are probabilities; simply summing them means a completely useless cue (validity 0.5) still adds a positive value to an option's score, distorting relative differences. The log-odds transformation correctly centers useless cues at a weight of zero and scales higher validities appropriately, yielding a more rigorous and theoretically sound compensatory WADD baseline.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.7191 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3561 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3561.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate implements a classic Weighted Additive (WADD) model by taking the dot product of the stimulus features and the raw cue validities. While this successfully establishes a compensatory baseline and was accepted by the gate, the fit quality on Experiments 3 and 5 is quite poor (JSD ~0.16-0.18 compared to real values of ~0.00). In human decision-making models, using raw validities (which are probabilities like 0.8 or 0.5) as linear weights is problematic because a useless cue (validity = 0.5) still adds a positive value to the sum, distorting the relative differences between options. A more standard and mathematically rigorous approach for WADD is to transform the validities into log-odds before computing the weighted sum.
Rationale: The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed WADD mechanism family but misses the empirical patterns in Experiments 3 and 5 due to how cue weights are defined. Please revise the `predict` function to transform the `validities` into log-odds (e.g., `weights = np.log(validities / (1.0 - validities))`, taking care to clip validities to avoid division by zero or log of zero) before computing the dot product. This adjustment keeps the model within the prescribed WADD family but properly centers useless cues at a weight of zero, which should significantly improve the fit across all experiments.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.7191 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3561 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The introduction of the log-odds transformation for cue validities significantly improved the model's aggregate loss (from 0.7191 to 0.3561) and was accepted by the gate. The model successfully centers non-predictive cues at zero, creating a theoretically rigorous Weighted Additive (WADD) baseline. While there are still some deviations in Experiment 5 (candidate 0.1195 vs. real 0.0024) and Experiment 4, the model overall captures the compensatory integration process well and serves its purpose as a strong baseline to compare against non-compensatory heuristics.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The current candidate faithfully implements the arbiter's prescribed WADD mechanism family. The previous recommendation to use log-odds weights was accepted and yielded a substantial improvement in fit. The model is now theoretically sound and provides a robust compensatory baseline. No further architectural changes are necessary for this theory at this stage."
