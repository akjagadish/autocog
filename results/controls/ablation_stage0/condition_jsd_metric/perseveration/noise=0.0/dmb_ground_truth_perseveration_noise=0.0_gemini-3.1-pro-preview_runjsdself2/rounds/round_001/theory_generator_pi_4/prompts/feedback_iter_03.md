# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Propose a 'Strategy Mixture' or 'Adaptive Strategy Selection' theory. This theory should posit that the population is heterogeneous (some subjects use TTB, others use WADD) or that individuals probabilistically switch between a one-reason decision rule (TTB) and a compensatory rule (WADD) on a trial-by-trial basis depending on the cue dispersion. The new model should include a mixing parameter that dictates the probability of applying TTB versus WADD, allowing it to capture the intermediate divergence observed in the real data across all experimental designs.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Decision makers probabilistically switch between a non-compensatory one-reason heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory approach (Weighted Additive rule) across trials. The probability of using the compensatory rule adapts on a trial-by-trial basis depending on the cue dispersion (the absolute difference in weighted cue values between the options). Furthermore, the two strategies operate on different scales of evidence, so they maintain independent levels of determinism (separate temperature parameters) when translating their respective scores into choice probabilities.

- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- wadd_prob: [0.0, 1.0]
- dispersion_weight: [-5.0, 5.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice from Iteration 3, the linear clipping mixture mechanism from Iteration 2 (the accepted running-best) is preserved, but the single `beta` parameter has been decoupled into `beta_wadd` and `beta_ttb`. Because the WADD component operates on continuous weighted sums and the TTB component operates on binary values (1.0 or 0.0), forcing them to share a single temperature parameter artificially coupled their decisiveness. Independent parameters allow the model to separately calibrate the determinism of the compensatory and non-compensatory strategies, providing the flexibility needed to better fit the observed human divergence values.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.7683 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.6968 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.7463 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.6901 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.6901.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate model successfully implements a strategy mixture between TTB and WADD and was accepted as the new running best. However, it currently uses a fixed `wadd_prob` parameter across all trials for a given subject. As a result, its simulated metric values (~0.03 - 0.07) significantly undershoot the real data's divergence values (~0.22 - 0.27) across all four experiments. The model fails to capture the trial-by-trial adaptive nature of strategy selection.
Rationale: While the mixture family is correct and was accepted, the candidate missed a key part of the arbiter's instruction: making the mixture depend on 'cue dispersion' on a trial-by-trial basis. Regenerate the model to dynamically compute a dispersion or conflict metric for each stimulus (e.g., the absolute difference in WADD scores, or the number of cues favoring each option) and use this to shift the probability of using WADD vs TTB on that specific trial. You can keep `wadd_prob` as a baseline or scaling parameter, but the actual mixture weight must be responsive to the trial's specific cue state.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.7683 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.6968 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The model successfully integrated the trial-by-trial adaptive strategy selection based on cue dispersion, and this change was accepted by the gate, improving the overall loss. However, the simulated metric values (ranging from 0.05 to 0.09) still significantly undershoot the real data divergence values (ranging from 0.22 to 0.27) across all four experiments. The current linear clipping approach to computing the trial-specific WADD probability may be too rigid or frequently hit the boundaries (0 or 1), limiting the model's ability to express the nuanced intermediate divergence found in human behavior.
Rationale: While the adaptive mixture direction is correct and improved the fit, the linear clipping function (`np.clip(wadd_prob + dispersion_weight * dispersion, 0.0, 1.0)`) is likely too abrupt. Regenerate the model to use a logistic (sigmoid) function to map the baseline and dispersion into a valid probability (e.g., `trial_wadd_prob = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-(wadd_base + dispersion_weight * dispersion)))`). Adjust the parameter ranges accordingly (e.g., `wadd_base` from [-5.0, 5.0]). This smoother transition should allow the model to better capture the intermediate strategy switching probabilities and close the gap with the real data.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.6968 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.7463 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate's shift to a logistic (sigmoid) function for the strategy mixture was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the linear clipping approach from Iteration 2 remains the running best. The simulated divergence values still significantly undershoot the real data across all experiments. A structural limitation in the current base model is that it shares a single `beta` parameter between the WADD component (where scores are continuous sums of validities) and the TTB component (where scores are binary 1.0 or 0.0). Because these two strategies operate on entirely different scales, forcing them to share a single temperature parameter artificially couples their decisiveness and limits the model's ability to fit the data.
Rationale: Since the logistic function was rejected, the next iteration will build on the accepted Iteration 2 base (which uses linear clipping). Keep the linear clipping mechanism, but decouple the temperature parameters: introduce separate `beta_wadd` and `beta_ttb` parameters (both with ranges like [0.1, 20.0]). This will allow the model to independently calibrate the determinism of the compensatory and non-compensatory strategies, giving it the flexibility needed to close the gap with the observed human divergence values.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.7463 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.6901 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate model successfully decoupled the temperature parameters for the WADD and TTB components, which was ACCEPTED by the gate and improved the overall loss. However, the simulated divergence values (ranging from ~0.06 to 0.10) still significantly undershoot the real data divergence values (ranging from ~0.22 to 0.27) across all four experiments. The gap indicates that the model's strategy mixture is not yet responsive enough to the trial-by-trial cue configurations to capture the observed empirical patterns.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The decoupled temperatures improved the fit, so keep `beta_wadd` and `beta_ttb` separate. However, the current dispersion metric (`abs(score_a_wadd - score_b_wadd)`) is unnormalized, meaning its scale changes depending on the number of cues and their validities in each specific experiment. Regenerate the model to normalize the dispersion by the sum of the cue validities (i.e., `dispersion = abs(score_a_wadd - score_b_wadd) / np.sum(val)`). This will bound the dispersion between 0 and 1, making the `dispersion_weight` parameter's effect consistent across different experimental designs. Additionally, widen the range for `dispersion_weight` to [-10.0, 10.0] to allow for stronger trial-by-trial shifts in strategy use."
