# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Decision makers adaptively switch between a non-compensatory one-reason heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory approach (Weighted Additive rule) across trials. Instead of a soft probabilistic mixture, individuals use a deterministic threshold on cue dispersion (the absolute difference in weighted cue values). If the dispersion exceeds a threshold, they fully commit to the compensatory rule; otherwise, they rely entirely on the one-reason heuristic. This hard-switching mechanism, combined with independent temperature scales for each strategy, captures the high choice determinism and divergence observed in human behavior.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback from Iteration 6, the model replaces the soft linear probabilistic strategy mixture with a deterministic threshold-based switch. The parameters `wadd_prob` and `dispersion_weight` have been replaced by a single `dispersion_threshold` parameter. On any given trial, if the cue dispersion exceeds this threshold, the model fully commits to the WADD strategy; otherwise, it fully commits to TTB. This structural change ensures that simulated choices remain highly deterministic, which will increase the divergence metric to better match the more extreme values observed in the human data.

**Parameters:**

```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their feature values, where the weights correspond to the subjective or objective validities of the cues (Weighted Additive rule, WADD). Rather than relying on a single discriminating cue (like Take The Best) or ignoring validities entirely (like Tallying), this compensatory strategy allows multiple lower-validity cues to jointly outweigh a single high-validity cue. Choices are made probabilistically via a softmax over the options' weighted sums, along with a lapse rate to account for random errors.

**Rationale:** Following the arbiter's instructions, this model implements the Weighted Additive (WADD) heuristic. Unlike Take The Best (which relies on a single cue) or Tallying (which weights all cues equally), WADD multiplies each feature by its validity and sums them to evaluate each option. This compensatory mechanism is capable of explaining behavior where participants trade off multiple weak cues against a single strong cue, which is often necessary to explain intermediate choice patterns observed across different experiments.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability

    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Soft Strategy Selection: Decision makers probabilistically mix between a non-compensatory one-reason heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory approach (Weighted Additive rule) across trials. The probability of deploying WADD versus TTB is modeled as a smooth logistic function of the cue dispersion (the absolute difference in WADD scores). This soft mixture allows for both the compensatory integration of WADD at higher dispersions and the non-compensatory dominance of TTB at lower dispersions, without forcing a stark discontinuity.

**Rationale:** Following the latest critic feedback, we revert to the Iteration 1 base mechanism (Soft Strategy Selection with unnormalized dispersion) but widen the parameter ranges to allow for highly deterministic behavior. The upper bounds for `beta_wadd`, `beta_ttb`, and `steepness` are increased to 50.0, and `dispersion_threshold` is increased to 20.0 to account for potentially large unnormalized WADD score differences. Additionally, the lapse rate `epsilon` is restricted to [0.0, 0.2] to prevent it from washing out the sharp strategy predictions needed to match the empirical JSD.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta_wadd`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `beta_ttb`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.2]`
  - `dispersion_threshold`: `[0.0, 20.0]`
