# generation_iter_03_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a 'Soft Strategy Selection' theory. Instead of a deterministic hard threshold for switching between Take The Best (TTB) and Weighted Additive (WADD) rules, individuals probabilistically mix the two strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. The probability of deploying WADD versus TTB should be modeled as a smooth logistic function of the cue dispersion (the absolute difference in WADD scores). This soft mixture allows for both the compensatory integration of WADD at higher dispersions and the non-compensatory dominance of TTB at lower dispersions, without forcing a stark discontinuity.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.045)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.007)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.002)

**Description**
Decision makers adaptively switch between a non-compensatory one-reason heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory approach (Weighted Additive rule) across trials. Instead of a soft probabilistic mixture, individuals use a deterministic threshold on cue dispersion (the absolute difference in weighted cue values). If the dispersion exceeds a threshold, they fully commit to the compensatory rule; otherwise, they rely entirely on the one-reason heuristic. This hard-switching mechanism, combined with independent temperature scales for each strategy, captures the high choice determinism and divergence observed in human behavior.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.6512 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.6787 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.7539 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.6512 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Soft Strategy Selection: Decision makers probabilistically mix between a non-compensatory one-reason heuristic (Take The Best) and a compensatory approach (Weighted Additive rule) across trials. The probability of deploying WADD versus TTB is modeled as a smooth logistic function of the cue dispersion (the absolute difference in WADD scores). This soft mixture allows for both the compensatory integration of WADD at higher dispersions and the non-compensatory dominance of TTB at lower dispersions, without forcing a stark discontinuity.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta_wadd: [0.1, 20.0]
- beta_ttb: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- dispersion_threshold: [0.0, 10.0]
- steepness: [0.1, 20.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: This theory adapts the hard-threshold strategy selection model into a probabilistic, soft-switching mechanism. By using a logistic function of cue dispersion, the model smoothly interpolates between WADD and TTB instead of abruptly switching. This aligns with the arbiter's suggestion to capture a continuous shift in strategy deployment, which often better represents the graded nature of cognitive resource allocation.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully implements the Soft Strategy Selection mechanism prescribed by the arbiter, and it has been ACCEPTED as the new running best. However, it severely underpredicts the target metric in several experiments (e.g., Exp 1, 3, and 5). The target metric explicitly conditions on the previous response (keys end in `|0` and `|1`), capturing sequential dependence / choice inertia. The current `predict` function completely ignores the `history` argument, meaning it predicts the exact same probabilities regardless of what the subject chose on the previous trial. This omission prevents the model from capturing the empirical sequential effects.
Rationale: Keep the soft strategy selection mechanism exactly as is, but introduce a 'choice inertia' or 'stickiness' parameter. Use the `history` argument to determine the previous choice, and apply a boost to the probability of repeating that choice (e.g., by adding a stickiness parameter to the logit of the previously chosen option, or by linearly mixing the core probability with a one-hot vector of the previous choice). This minor adjustment is necessary to capture the sequential dependencies measured by the experiment metrics.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.6512 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.6787 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The previous attempt to introduce choice inertia to capture sequential dependencies was REJECTED by the accept gate, as it worsened the overall loss. The metric evaluates the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the simulated data and a reference policy (P_REF). The real data shows a significant divergence from P_REF (e.g., ~0.27 in Exp 1), while the candidate model's simulated data is too close to P_REF (~0.01). This indicates the core strategy mixture is not producing the empirical distribution of choices.
Rationale: Since the addition of choice inertia was rejected, we should revert to the base Soft Strategy Selection model and focus on tuning the mixture mechanism itself. The current logistic function for mixing WADD and TTB uses the raw absolute difference in WADD scores. Because the scale of WADD scores varies across experiments depending on the number of features and validity weights, a fixed `dispersion_threshold` range [0.0, 10.0] might not generalize well. Try normalizing the cue dispersion by the maximum possible dispersion (the sum of all validities) so it falls in [0, 1], and adjust the `dispersion_threshold` range to [0.0, 1.0]. Keep the mechanism strictly within the arbiter's Soft Strategy Selection family.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.6787 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.7539 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate's attempt to normalize the cue dispersion (Iteration 3) resulted in a higher aggregate loss (0.7539) and was REJECTED by the gate, meaning the loop will revert to the Iteration 1 base (loss=0.6512). The Iteration 1 base uses unnormalized dispersion but still severely underpredicts the JSD metric in Experiments 1, 3, and 5. Since both choice inertia and normalized dispersion have been rejected, the discrepancy might lie in the parameter ranges causing the model to become too deterministic. When beta values or steepness are too high, the model's predicted probabilities collapse to 0 or 1, which might prevent it from matching the empirical variance captured by the JSD metric.
Rationale: Since the previous structural changes (inertia, normalization) were rejected, return to the exact mechanism of the Iteration 1 base (unnormalized absolute dispersion for the logistic mixture) but apply minor adjustments to the parameter ranges. Specifically, constrain the temperature parameters `beta_wadd` and `beta_ttb` to a narrower range (e.g., [0.1, 5.0] instead of [0.1, 20.0]) and `steepness` to [0.1, 5.0]. This will prevent the softmax and logistic functions from saturating too quickly, maintaining the probabilistic nature of the Soft Strategy Selection and allowing the model to better match the empirical JSD.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.7539 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
