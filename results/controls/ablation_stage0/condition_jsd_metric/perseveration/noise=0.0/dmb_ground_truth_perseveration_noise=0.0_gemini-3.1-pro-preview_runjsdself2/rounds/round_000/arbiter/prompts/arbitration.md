# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=5):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To quantitatively dissociate Take The Best (TTB) from Tallying, the experiment employs a set of five binary features with strictly descending validities. The trials are specifically constructed so that the option with the highest valid discriminating cue (favored by TTB) always has fewer total positive features than the alternative option (which is favored by Tallying). Under TTB, subjects will base their decision solely on the single most valid cue that differs between the options, ignoring the sheer number of features. Under Tallying, subjects will simply count the total number of winning features for each option, ignoring the validities entirely. These opposing predictions will yield a stark contrast in choice probabilities between the two models.

**Computed schedule:** 5 unique pairs × 19 reps = 95 trials per subject.

Rationale:
Auto-generated JSD-to-self metric (jsd_metric control): sequence-aware Jensen-Shannon divergence (nats, 0 to ln 2) between the dataset's conditional choice profile and the proposing theory's, over (trial content, previous response) states. 0 means the data behaves exactly like the proposing theory; ln 2 means maximally different.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_2)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To decisively dissociate Tallying from Take The Best (TTB), we design trials where one option wins on the single highest-validity discriminating cue (the choice favored by TTB), but the alternative option wins on a strictly greater number of lower-validity cues (the choice favored by Tallying). By systematically varying which cue is the highest discriminating cue (e.g., the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd most valid cue) and tying higher-validity cues, we can robustly verify whether subjects integrate across all features equally (Tallying) or stop at the first discriminating cue (TTB).

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Neither theory successfully captures the observed data across both experiments. In Experiment 1 (designed to favor Take The Best), the observed JSD to TTB was 0.2769, closely matching Tallying's prediction (0.2684) and indicating subjects did not strictly use TTB. Conversely, in Experiment 2 (designed to favor Tallying), the observed JSD to Tallying was 0.2751, closely matching TTB's prediction (0.2646) and indicating subjects did not strictly use Tallying either. This mutual failure suggests that human decision-making in this paradigm is neither purely one-reason (TTB) nor purely unweighted (Tallying). Instead, subjects likely use a compensatory strategy that incorporates both feature validities and the number of features, such as a Weighted Additive (WADD) model.",

  "recommendation": "Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. Unlike TTB (which only uses the single best discriminating cue) and Tallying (which weights all cues equally), WADD computes a weighted sum of the feature values for each option, where the weights are strictly proportional to the cue validities. The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen, with response noise governed by a softmax function over these sums. This allows multiple lower-validity cues to jointly outweigh a single high-validity cue, potentially explaining the intermediate behavior observed in both experiments."
