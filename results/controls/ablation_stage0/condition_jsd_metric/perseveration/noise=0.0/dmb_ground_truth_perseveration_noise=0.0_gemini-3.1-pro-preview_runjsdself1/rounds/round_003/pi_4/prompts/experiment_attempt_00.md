## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended heuristics (e.g. TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every heuristic agrees, and prefer pairs that dissociate single-feature focus from feature-summing strategies. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Population-level Strategy Selection Mixture Model: The population consists of distinct subgroups of decision-makers. Some individuals consistently use a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) while others consistently use a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive). This discrete between-subject variation in strategy selection accounts for the high individual divergence from the population average, and low lapse rates ensure that the distinct strategy signatures are not washed out by noise.

**Parameters:**

- w_wadd: [0.0, 1.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.1]
- validities: validities

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Decision-makers use an 'Equal Weight' or Tallying heuristic to choose between options. Instead of weighting features by their validities (which is cognitively demanding) or relying on a single best cue, individuals simply count the total number of positive features for each option. The option with the higher total count of positive features is preferred. Choice probabilities are derived using a softmax function over these unweighted counts, reflecting bounded rationality by ignoring complex weights to reduce cognitive load.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.0, 20.0]

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Count the total number of positive features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a)
    score_b = np.sum(b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax over the unweighted counts
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return p_core
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()

```


## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] This design systematically pits Take The Best (TTB) against Tallying using a 5-cue environment with strictly descending validities. In most trials, the option that wins on the highest-validity discriminating cue (favored by TTB) is explicitly configured to lose on the simple count of total winning cues (favored by Tallying). For example, Option A may have a positive feature on the most valid cue but negative features on all others, while Option B has negative on the first but positive on three others. This directly dissociates the single-reason stopping rule of TTB from the unweighted evidence-summation rule of Tallying.

[1] This experiment is designed to quantitatively dissociate Tallying from Take The Best (TTB) using a 4-feature environment with strictly descending validities. The trial pairs are specifically constructed to pit the unweighted, exhaustive evidence summation of Tallying against the one-reason stopping rule of TTB. The design includes trials where the two heuristics make diametrically opposite predictions (e.g., one option wins on the highest validity cue but loses on the remaining three), as well as trials where Tallying predicts a tie (because both options win on an equal number of features) while TTB makes a strong deterministic prediction based on the single highest-validity discriminating cue.

[2] This design systematically pits Take The Best (TTB) against the Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy using a 4-feature environment. The validities are chosen such that the most valid cue is strong (0.90), but the sum of the remaining three cues (0.75 + 0.65 + 0.55 = 1.95) or even pairs of them can easily outweigh it. The trial pairs are constructed to create direct conflicts: in many trials, one option wins on the single highest-validity discriminating cue (triggering TTB to choose it), while the other option has more positive features on lower-validity cues such that their combined weighted sum is greater (triggering WADD to choose the opposite). This provides a sharp quantitative dissociation between the non-compensatory one-reason stopping rule and the fully compensatory weighted integration of evidence.

[3] This design quantitatively dissociates the Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy from Take The Best (TTB) by exploiting the compensatory nature of WADD against the non-compensatory, one-reason stopping rule of TTB. The validities are structured such that the highest validity cue strongly favors one option, but the sum of the remaining lower-validity cues easily outweighs it. Across the trials, one option is designed to win on the highest discriminating cue (triggering TTB), while the other option amasses enough positive features on the remaining cues to secure a higher weighted sum (triggering WADD). By shifting which cues tie and which discriminate, we completely separate the two models' predictions.

[4] This design quantitatively dissociates the advocated Strategy Selection model from the pure Weighted Additive (WADD) model. The advocated model can adopt a pure Take The Best (TTB) strategy (when w_wadd < 0.5), whereas the competing model is restricted solely to WADD. By using an environment where the single highest-validity cue is consistently outweighed by the sum of the remaining lower-validity cues, we create trials where TTB and WADD make diametrically opposing predictions. If a substantial portion of the population uses TTB, the advocated model can capture this by switching to the TTB component, while the pure WADD model will fail to fit the choices.

[5] To quantitatively dissociate the advocated Weighted Additive (WADD) theory from the competing Strategy Selection Mixture Model, this design maximizes the conflict between compensatory feature-summing (WADD) and non-compensatory one-reason decision making (TTB). We use a 4-feature environment where the most valid cue strongly favors one option, but the sum of the remaining cues outweighs it. By heavily populating the design with trials where TTB and WADD make diametrically opposite predictions, we ensure that the compensatory nature of WADD is rigorously tested.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — heuristics that rely on validity-ordering re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) collapse WADD into a scaled Equal-Weight rule and make them indistinguishable by any decision.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended heuristics (TTB, EQW, Tallying, WADD) be dissociated; avoid trials where every heuristic agrees.

  "rationale": "This design quantitatively dissociates the advocated Strategy Selection Mixture Model (which posits individuals use either a non-compensatory Take The Best strategy or a compensatory Weighted Additive strategy) from the competing Tallying/Equal-Weight model. Validities are chosen such that the top two cues strongly outweigh the bottom three. In several trials, an option has only two positive features (on the highest validities) while the other option has three positive features (on the lowest validities). In these cases, Tallying predicts the option with three features will be chosen. However, both components of the advocated model (TTB and WADD) predict the option with two features will win, creating a sharp divergence. Other trials pit TTB directly against WADD while both diverge from Tallying's predictions, ensuring the mixture model can capture the choices while the simple tallying heuristic fails.",
