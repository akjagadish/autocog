# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    # Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors for the current
    # trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features), row 0 = option A,
    # row 1 = option B. Cue cascade: features are consulted in order
    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )
    n_features = stim.shape[1]

        raise ValueError(
            f"validities length {val.shape[0]} != n_features {n_features}."
        )
    # Descending validity; argsort is stable so validity ties break
    # toward the earlier feature index.
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()

    winner = None
    for j in cue_order:
        if a[j] > b[j]:
            winner = 0
            break
        if b[j] > a[j]:
            winner = 1
            break

    if winner is None:
        # No discriminating cue — pure guess.
        return np.ones(2) / 2.0

    scores = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) if winner == 0 else np.array([0.0, 1.0])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. For the
    # binary TTB score this collapses to sigmoid(beta) for the winner,
    # giving a direct mapping from beta onto the paper's flip-noise
    # levels (beta=0 ↔ 50/50; beta ≫ 1 ↔ deterministic).
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People evaluate options using a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. Decision-makers compute an overall utility for each option by summing its feature values weighted by their respective cue validities. This compensatory process allows multiple weaker cues to jointly override a single stronger cue if their combined weight is greater. Choice probabilities are then generated via a softmax function over these weighted sums, without an additional lapse rate, allowing for strong deterministic commitments when beta is high.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice on the rejected iteration, we remove the epsilon lapse rate entirely to simplify the model and prevent the WADD signal from washing out. We adjust the beta range to [0.0, 20.0] to allow the model to make more extreme, deterministic predictions. This should help capture the higher individual-level variance (JSD metric) observed in the real data without pulling probabilities too close to 0.5.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 20.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Weighted additive sums for each option
    score_a = np.sum(val * a)
    score_b = np.sum(val * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return p_core
```

    import numpy as np

## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Population-level Strategy Selection Mixture Model: The population consists of distinct subgroups of decision-makers. Some individuals consistently use a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) while others consistently use a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive). This discrete between-subject variation in strategy selection accounts for the high individual divergence from the population average, and low lapse rates ensure that the distinct strategy signatures are not washed out by noise.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, we build upon the accepted Iteration 2 base (the population-level strict mixture model). To increase the JSD and make subjects more distinctly divergent from the population average, we restrict the lapse rate (epsilon) to a much lower range [0.0, 0.1] and increase the maximum inverse temperature (beta) up to 30.0. High lapse rates wash out individual differences, causing choices to regress toward the population mean. By reducing epsilon and allowing sharper, more deterministic choices, subjects utilizing TTB and WADD will behave starkly differently, driving the between-subject variance (JSD) up toward the empirical targets.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta_wadd`: `[0.1, 30.0]`
  - `beta_ttb`: `[0.1, 30.0]`
