# feedback_iter_06

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a 'Mixture Strategy Theory' or 'Tallying / Validity-Threshold Theory'. A Mixture Strategy Theory would posit that decision-makers are heterogenous or trial-by-trial variable: they probabilistically employ WADD on some trials/subjects and a heuristic like TTB or Tallying on others. Alternatively, a 'Validity-Threshold Tallying Theory' would posit that subjects only consider features whose validities exceed a certain threshold, and simply tally the number of winning features among that subset rather than strictly weighting them by exact validity. This could bridge the gap between the purely compensatory WADD and the purely non-compensatory TTB.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Integrated Utility Theory (WADD + Tallying): Decision-makers integrate both compensatory validity weighting (WADD) and non-compensatory feature counting (Tallying) into a single, unified subjective value for each option. Rather than stochastically switching between strategies on a trial-by-trial basis, they form a composite score by taking a weighted average of the WADD and Tallying scores. This composite score is then translated into choice probabilities via a single softmax process subject to decision noise and lapses.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = float(parameters["w"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # WADD scores
    wadd_scores = np.sum(stim * val, axis=1)
    
    # Tallying scores (strict wins)
    tally_scores = np.array([np.sum(a > b), np.sum(b > a)], dtype=float)
    
    # Mix scores instead of probabilities
    mixed_scores = w * wadd_scores + (1.0 - w) * tally_scores
    
    z = beta * (mixed_scores - np.max(mixed_scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- w: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, this minimal edit changes how the WADD and Tallying components are combined. Instead of applying a softmax to each strategy independently and mixing their resulting probabilities (which implies a trial-by-trial stochastic switching between strategies), the model now computes a weighted average of the raw scores (utilities) from WADD and Tallying before applying a single softmax. This integrated utility approach posits that individuals simultaneously weigh exact validities and simple feature counts to form a unified evaluation, potentially offering a better structural fit without adding new parameters.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2954 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3144 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.4296 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.5657 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.3264 -> REJECTED
- iter 6: loss=0.3534 -> REJECTED
- iter 7 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2748 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 7 at loss=0.2748.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Mixture Strategy Theory (WADD + Tallying) successfully captures a broad range of behavior across the experiments, resulting in a new running-best loss and being ACCEPTED by the gate. By blending compensatory and non-compensatory heuristics, it balances the different experimental designs well. However, looking closely at the evaluation metrics, they explicitly condition on the previous trial's response (r[t-1]). The discrepancy between the simulated metric values and the real data (particularly in Experiments 1, 3, and 6) suggests that human subjects exhibit choice perseveration (history dependence) that the current memoryless model fails to capture.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED and provides an excellent base. To close the remaining gap, keep the exact WADD + Tallying mixture family, but add a choice perseveration (stickiness) mechanism. You can implement this by introducing a `stickiness` parameter (e.g., range [-1.0, 2.0]) that adds a bonus to the logit (or directly to the probability) of the option chosen on the previous trial (passed in via the `history` argument). This minor adjustment will allow the model to capture the sequence-dependent behavior evident in the real data.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2954 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3144 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The addition of the choice perseveration (stickiness) parameter failed to improve the model's fit, resulting in an increased aggregate loss and rejection by the accept gate. While sequential dependence is present in the data, adding it via a logit bonus to both strategies may have disrupted the delicate balance between the compensatory (WADD) and non-compensatory (Tallying) processes.
Rationale: Since the stickiness mechanism was REJECTED, drop it and revert to the memoryless base. To improve the fit while staying within the arbiter's prescribed family, implement the alternative suggestion: a 'Validity-Threshold Tallying' mechanism. Introduce a `threshold` parameter (e.g., [0.5, 1.0]). In the Tallying component, subjects should only tally features whose validities exceed this threshold, rather than all features where one option strictly beats the other. Mix this Validity-Threshold Tallying strategy with WADD.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3144 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.4296 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Validity-Threshold Tallying adjustment resulted in a higher aggregate loss (0.4296) and was rejected by the gate. The loop will now revert to the running-best base from iteration 1 (loss 0.2954), which mixed WADD and simple Tallying. The failure of the threshold tallying mechanism suggests that selectively ignoring low-validity cues in a tally does not capture the non-compensatory behavior of the subjects as well as we hoped.
Rationale: Since the Validity-Threshold Tallying was REJECTED, the proposer should build on the iteration 1 base. To improve the mixture model while staying within the arbiter's prescribed family, swap the Tallying component for a Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. Mix WADD with TTB instead of Tallying. TTB should evaluate features in descending order of their validity and base the decision entirely on the first feature that discriminates between the two options. This provides a purer non-compensatory contrast to WADD. Keep the mixture weight `w`, the temperature `beta`, and the lapse rate `epsilon`.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.4296 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.5657 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate replaced Tallying with Take-The-Best (TTB) in the mixture model. This resulted in a significant increase in aggregate loss (0.5657) and was REJECTED by the gate. The loop will revert again to the strong iteration 1 base (WADD + simple Tallying, loss 0.2954). The repeated rejection of alternative non-compensatory mechanisms (Threshold Tallying, TTB) and history-dependence (stickiness) suggests that the basic WADD + Tallying mixture is structurally very close to the true data generating process, but might be too rigid in how the heuristic is applied.
Rationale: Since the TTB mixture was REJECTED, build on the iteration 1 base (WADD + Tallying). To refine this base without disrupting its core balance, soften the Tallying component. Instead of Tallying returning a deterministic 1.0/0.0 probability for the option with the higher tally, apply a softmax function to the tally scores using a new, separate temperature parameter `beta_tally` (e.g., range [0.1, 10.0]). This allows the heuristic component to be probabilistic, providing a smoother mixture with the WADD probabilities.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.5657 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.3264 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate introduced a separate temperature parameter (`beta_tally`) for the Tallying component. This resulted in an aggregate loss of 0.3264, which is worse than the running-best base from iteration 1 (0.2954). Consequently, the candidate was REJECTED by the accept gate, and the loop will revert to the iteration 1 base. The repeated rejection of structural modifications (stickiness, validity thresholds, TTB, and now separate temperatures) strongly suggests that the exact functional form of the iteration 1 base (a simple probability mixture of WADD and Tallying) is the optimal structure within this family, and further structural complexity leads to overfitting or miscalibration.
Rationale: Since the separate `beta_tally` parameter was REJECTED, the proposer must build on the unchanged iteration 1 base. Stop adding new mechanisms or parameters. The iteration 1 base is structurally sound. To squeeze out the remaining performance gap, keep the exact predict and policy functions from iteration 1, but widen the parameter search space to allow the optimizer to find sharper or softer distributions if needed. Specifically, expand the upper bound of the shared `beta` parameter to 50.0 (i.e., `[0.1, 50.0]`) and the `epsilon` lapse rate to `[0.0, 1.0]`. Make no other changes.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.3264 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.3534 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 6 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Widening the parameter bounds failed to improve the aggregate loss (0.3534) and was REJECTED by the gate. The loop reverts to the Iteration 1 base (loss 0.2954). The repeated rejection of various structural additions (stickiness, thresholds, TTB, separate temperatures) and bound adjustments indicates that while the WADD + Tallying components are correct, the way they are combined might be slightly mis-specified. Currently, the model mixes the *probabilities* of the two strategies, implying a trial-by-trial probabilistic switching (a dual-process coin flip). An alternative within the exact same family is to mix the *scores* (values/logits) before passing them through a single softmax.
Rationale: Since the parameter bound expansion was REJECTED, return to the Iteration 1 base. To subtly improve the structural fit without adding new parameters, change how the WADD and Tallying components are integrated. Instead of applying the softmax to each strategy separately and mixing the resulting probabilities, mix the raw scores first: `mixed_scores = w * wadd_scores + (1.0 - w) * tally_scores`. Then, apply the shared `beta` and softmax to `mixed_scores`. This represents a unified evaluation process that integrates both exact validities and simple feature tallies into a single utility before adding decision noise, rather than a probabilistic switching model.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.3534 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2748 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Integrated Utility Theory successfully reduced the aggregate loss to 0.2748, becoming the new running-best and being ACCEPTED by the gate. By mixing the raw utilities (scores) of the WADD and Tallying strategies before applying a single softmax, the model elegantly captures a unified evaluation process rather than a trial-by-trial stochastic switching mechanism. This structural refinement significantly improved the fit across multiple experiments without adding any new parameters, demonstrating that subjects likely integrate both compensatory validities and non-compensatory feature counts into a composite subjective value.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The candidate was ACCEPTED and provides an excellent, parsimonious account of the data within the prescribed mechanism family. The shift from mixing probabilities to mixing utilities (scores) proved to be the correct structural adjustment, achieving the lowest loss yet. The current predict function, policy, and parameter ranges are well-calibrated and theoretically sound. No further adjustments are needed; ship this candidate."
