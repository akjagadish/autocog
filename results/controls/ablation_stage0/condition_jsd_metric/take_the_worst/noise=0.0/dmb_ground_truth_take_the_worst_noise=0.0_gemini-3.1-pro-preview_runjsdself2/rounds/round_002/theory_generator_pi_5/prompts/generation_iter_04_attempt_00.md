# generation_iter_04_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`

- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a 'Mixture Strategy Theory' or 'Tallying / Validity-Threshold Theory'. A Mixture Strategy Theory would posit that decision-makers are heterogenous or trial-by-trial variable: they probabilistically employ WADD on some trials/subjects and a heuristic like TTB or Tallying on others. Alternatively, a 'Validity-Threshold Tallying Theory' would posit that subjects only consider features whose validities exceed a certain threshold, and simply tally the number of winning features among that subset rather than strictly weighting them by exact validity. This could bridge the gap between the purely compensatory WADD and the purely non-compensatory TTB.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.912)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.524)

**Description**
Weighted Additive (WADD) theory posits that decision-makers integrate all available cues by weighting them proportionally to their validities. The overall value for each option is the validity-weighted sum of its features. Choices are made probabilistically via a softmax over these aggregated values, incorporating response noise through an inverse temperature parameter and an independent lapse rate.

def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.2954 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.3144 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.4296 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.5657 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2954 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Mixture Strategy Theory (WADD + Tallying): Decision-makers are heterogeneous or trial-by-trial variable in their strategy use. On any given trial, a subject probabilistically employs either a fully compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy or a simpler, non-compensatory Tallying heuristic. WADD integrates all cues weighted by their validities, while Tallying simply counts the number of winning features for each option, ignoring exact validities. The final choice probability is a mixture of the probabilities generated by these two strategies, subject to response noise and lapses.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    w = float(parameters["w"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # WADD scores
    wadd_scores = np.sum(stim * val, axis=1)
    z_wadd = beta * (wadd_scores - np.max(wadd_scores))
    e_wadd = np.exp(z_wadd)
    p_wadd = e_wadd / np.sum(e_wadd)
    
    # Tallying scores (strict wins)
    tally_scores = np.array([np.sum(a > b), np.sum(b > a)], dtype=float)
    z_tally = beta * (tally_scores - np.max(tally_scores))
    e_tally = np.exp(z_tally)
    p_tally = e_tally / np.sum(e_tally)
    
    # Mixture of the two strategies
    p_core = w * p_wadd + (1.0 - w) * p_tally
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- w: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`: Following the arbiter's suggestion, this Mixture Strategy Theory bridges the gap between compensatory (WADD) and non-compensatory (Tallying) decision-making. By positing that individuals probabilistically switch between strict validity-weighting and simple feature-counting (or that the population is a mixture of these types), the model can flexibly capture behavior across experiments where purely one strategy or the other fails. This formulation retains the high performance of the Tallying heuristic while allowing WADD-like sensitivity to validities when necessary.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Mixture Strategy Theory (WADD + Tallying) successfully captures a broad range of behavior across the experiments, resulting in a new running-best loss and being ACCEPTED by the gate. By blending compensatory and non-compensatory heuristics, it balances the different experimental designs well. However, looking closely at the evaluation metrics, they explicitly condition on the previous trial's response (r[t-1]). The discrepancy between the simulated metric values and the real data (particularly in Experiments 1, 3, and 6) suggests that human subjects exhibit choice perseveration (history dependence) that the current memoryless model fails to capture.
Rationale: The candidate was ACCEPTED and provides an excellent base. To close the remaining gap, keep the exact WADD + Tallying mixture family, but add a choice perseveration (stickiness) mechanism. You can implement this by introducing a `stickiness` parameter (e.g., range [-1.0, 2.0]) that adds a bonus to the logit (or directly to the probability) of the option chosen on the previous trial (passed in via the `history` argument). This minor adjustment will allow the model to capture the sequence-dependent behavior evident in the real data.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2954 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.3144 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The addition of the choice perseveration (stickiness) parameter failed to improve the model's fit, resulting in an increased aggregate loss and rejection by the accept gate. While sequential dependence is present in the data, adding it via a logit bonus to both strategies may have disrupted the delicate balance between the compensatory (WADD) and non-compensatory (Tallying) processes.
Rationale: Since the stickiness mechanism was REJECTED, drop it and revert to the memoryless base. To improve the fit while staying within the arbiter's prescribed family, implement the alternative suggestion: a 'Validity-Threshold Tallying' mechanism. Introduce a `threshold` parameter (e.g., [0.5, 1.0]). In the Tallying component, subjects should only tally features whose validities exceed this threshold, rather than all features where one option strictly beats the other. Mix this Validity-Threshold Tallying strategy with WADD.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.3144 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.4296 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Validity-Threshold Tallying adjustment resulted in a higher aggregate loss (0.4296) and was rejected by the gate. The loop will now revert to the running-best base from iteration 1 (loss 0.2954), which mixed WADD and simple Tallying. The failure of the threshold tallying mechanism suggests that selectively ignoring low-validity cues in a tally does not capture the non-compensatory behavior of the subjects as well as we hoped.
Rationale: Since the Validity-Threshold Tallying was REJECTED, the proposer should build on the iteration 1 base. To improve the mixture model while staying within the arbiter's prescribed family, swap the Tallying component for a Take-The-Best (TTB) heuristic. Mix WADD with TTB instead of Tallying. TTB should evaluate features in descending order of their validity and base the decision entirely on the first feature that discriminates between the two options. This provides a purer non-compensatory contrast to WADD. Keep the mixture weight `w`, the temperature `beta`, and the lapse rate `epsilon`.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.4296 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.5657 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate replaced Tallying with Take-The-Best (TTB) in the mixture model. This resulted in a significant increase in aggregate loss (0.5657) and was REJECTED by the gate. The loop will revert again to the strong iteration 1 base (WADD + simple Tallying, loss 0.2954). The repeated rejection of alternative non-compensatory mechanisms (Threshold Tallying, TTB) and history-dependence (stickiness) suggests that the basic WADD + Tallying mixture is structurally very close to the true data generating process, but might be too rigid in how the heuristic is applied.
Rationale: Since the TTB mixture was REJECTED, build on the iteration 1 base (WADD + Tallying). To refine this base without disrupting its core balance, soften the Tallying component. Instead of Tallying returning a deterministic 1.0/0.0 probability for the option with the higher tally, apply a softmax function to the tally scores using a new, separate temperature parameter `beta_tally` (e.g., range [0.1, 10.0]). This allows the heuristic component to be probabilistic, providing a smoother mixture with the WADD probabilities.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.5657 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.
