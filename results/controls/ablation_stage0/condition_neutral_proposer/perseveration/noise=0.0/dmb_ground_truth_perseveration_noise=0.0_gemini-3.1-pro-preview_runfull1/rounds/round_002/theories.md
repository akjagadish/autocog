# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Strategy Selection (Mixed Heuristics): Decision-makers probabilistically sample between a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a simple compensatory heuristic (Tallying) on a trial-by-trial basis. The probability of using Tallying increases with the ease of the choice, defined by the absolute difference in the number of features favoring each option. By restricting the sensitivity parameter of this mixture, decision-makers preserve a baseline probability of using TTB even when Tallying discriminates, matching empirical reliance on dominant cues while pulling highly conflicting trials toward chance.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the parameter ranges have been adjusted to prevent the Tallying weight from saturating too quickly. The `gamma` parameter range is restricted to `[0.0, 1.0]` (down from `[0.0, 5.0]`), ensuring that `w_tally` does not immediately jump to near 1.0 on high-difference trials, which preserves a baseline probability of using TTB. Additionally, the `epsilon` range is widened to `[0.0, 1.0]` and the maximum `beta` is lowered to `10.0` to help pull the highly conflicting trials in Experiments 1 and 2 closer to the observed 0.50 probability.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Weighted Additive Model (WADD). Decision-makers integrate all available information by computing a sum of each option's features weighted by their respective validities, transformed into log-odds. The option with the higher weighted sum is chosen, providing a fully compensatory decision rule. Response noise enters through a softmax over the weighted sums with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we widened the parameter bounds for beta to [0.0, 20.0] and epsilon to [0.0, 1.0]. This allows the model to capture purely random choice behavior, as empirical human ground-truth values show exactly chance-level performance (0.5000) on the provided metrics. The core WADD mechanism remains untouched.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.0, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    # Convert validities to log-odds weights to act as normative Bayesian evidence
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)
    weights = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    
    scores = np.array([np.sum(a * weights), np.sum(b * weights)])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax over weighted sums with max-subtraction for numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = len(p_core)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

```


## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Sequential Evidence Accumulation with Normalized Weights: Decision-makers inspect cues sequentially in descending order of validity. Each cue's difference updates a running evidence tally weighted by the cue's normalized log-odds validity. Normalizing the weights ensures that the accumulated evidence scales consistently across different experiments, making the latent decision threshold an invariant parameter. If the absolute evidence crosses this threshold, search stops and a choice is made immediately. If all cues are exhausted without crossing the threshold, the decision defaults to the accumulated tally.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the log-odds weights are now normalized by their sum. This minimal edit bounds the maximum possible accumulated evidence to 1.0 (or -1.0), ensuring consistent scaling across experiments with different validities. Consequently, the threshold parameter is restricted to [0.0, 1.0]. This makes the threshold parameter experiment-invariant, allowing the model to robustly transition between early-stopping (Take-The-Best) and full-integration (Weighted Additive) behavior regardless of the specific validities presented in a given experiment.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `threshold`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**

    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)
    weights = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    weights = weights / np.sum(weights)
    
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
    
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    
    E = 0.0
    for j in cue_order:
        diff = a[j] - b[j]
        E += diff * weights[j]
        # Stop search if evidence crosses threshold (and is non-zero to skip ties)
        if abs(E) >= threshold and abs(E) > 1e-5:
            break
            
    # E > 0 favors option A, E < 0 favors option B
