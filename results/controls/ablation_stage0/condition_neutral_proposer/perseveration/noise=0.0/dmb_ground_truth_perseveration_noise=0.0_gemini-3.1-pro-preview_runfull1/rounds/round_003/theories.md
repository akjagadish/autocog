## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Strategy Selection (Mixed Heuristics): Decision-makers probabilistically sample between a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) and a simple compensatory heuristic (Tallying) on a trial-by-trial basis. The probability of using Tallying increases with the ease of the choice, defined by the absolute difference in the number of features favoring each option. By restricting the sensitivity parameter of this mixture, decision-makers preserve a baseline probability of using TTB even when Tallying discriminates, matching empirical reliance on dominant cues while pulling highly conflicting trials toward chance.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's feedback, the parameter ranges have been adjusted to prevent the Tallying weight from saturating too quickly. The `gamma` parameter range is restricted to `[0.0, 1.0]` (down from `[0.0, 5.0]`), ensuring that `w_tally` does not immediately jump to near 1.0 on high-difference trials, which preserves a baseline probability of using TTB. Additionally, the `epsilon` range is widened to `[0.0, 1.0]` and the maximum `beta` is lowered to `10.0` to help pull the highly conflicting trials in Experiments 1 and 2 closer to the observed 0.50 probability.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

```


### slot 2 — `pi_5` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Sequential Evidence Accumulation with Normalized Weights: Decision-makers inspect cues sequentially in descending order of validity. Each cue's difference updates a running evidence tally weighted by the cue's normalized log-odds validity. Normalizing the weights ensures that the accumulated evidence scales consistently across different experiments, making the latent decision threshold an invariant parameter. If the absolute evidence crosses this threshold, search stops and a choice is made immediately. If all cues are exhausted without crossing the threshold, the decision defaults to the accumulated tally.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, the log-odds weights are now normalized by their sum. This minimal edit bounds the maximum possible accumulated evidence to 1.0 (or -1.0), ensuring consistent scaling across experiments with different validities. Consequently, the threshold parameter is restricted to [0.0, 1.0]. This makes the threshold parameter experiment-invariant, allowing the model to robustly transition between early-stopping (Take-The-Best) and full-integration (Weighted Additive) behavior regardless of the specific validities presented in a given experiment.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `threshold`: `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    # Convert validities to log-odds weights and normalize
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)
    weights = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    weights = weights / np.sum(weights)
    
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable").tolist()
    
    threshold = float(parameters["threshold"])
    
    E = 0.0
    for j in cue_order:
        diff = a[j] - b[j]
        E += diff * weights[j]
        # Stop search if evidence crosses threshold (and is non-zero to skip ties)
        if abs(E) >= threshold and abs(E) > 1e-5:
            break
            
    # E > 0 favors option A, E < 0 favors option B

## Replacement

### `pi_6` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Rank-Weighted Exponential Integration: Decision-makers evaluate all cues simultaneously but weight them exponentially according to their validity rank (weight = alpha^(-rank)). This creates a non-compensatory profile that mimics Take-The-Best when cues are aligned, but naturally allows for compensatory overrides when multiple lower-ranked cues strongly align against the top cue, capturing regressions to chance in highly conflicting trial designs.

**Rationale:** Following the latest feedback, we reverted to the exact Rank-Weighted Exponential Integration mechanism from the Iteration 2 base, as it successfully balanced TTB-like behavior and compensatory overrides. To avoid the over-determinism that hurt previous iterations, we capped the softmax inverse temperature `beta` at 5.0 and the lapse rate `epsilon` at 0.5. By restricting `beta`, we prevent the model from exaggerating tiny score differences into 1.0/0.0 choices, thereby preserving the chance-level (~0.5) regressions required in perfectly symmetric conflict trials (Exps 2, 4, 6, 8).

**Parameters:**
  - `alpha`: `[1.0, 2.5]`
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 5.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]

    # Determine the rank of each cue (0 = highest validity, 1 = second highest, etc.)
    cue_order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")
    ranks = np.empty_like(cue_order)
    ranks[cue_order] = np.arange(len(val))
    
    alpha = float(parameters["alpha"])
    # Exponentially decay weights based on rank
    weights = alpha ** (-ranks)
    
    score_a = np.sum(a * weights)
    score_b = np.sum(b * weights)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax

    z -= np.max(z)
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
