# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Propose a 'Sequential Evidence Accumulation' (or Threshold-based Lexicographic) theory. In this theory, decision-makers inspect cues sequentially in descending order of validity. Each cue's difference updates a running evidence tally. If the accumulated evidence crosses a latent decision threshold, search stops and a choice is made immediately (mimicking TTB if the threshold is low and crossed on the first cue). If all cues are exhausted without crossing the threshold, the decision defaults to the current tally or a random guess. This bridges the gap between TTB and WADD by allowing early stopping (explaining the 70% TTB matches in Exp 5) while permitting compensatory integration when early cues are weak or conflicting (explaining the ~0.50 rates in highly conflicting trials).


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Sequential Evidence Accumulation: Decision-makers inspect cues sequentially in descending order of validity. Each cue's difference updates a running evidence tally weighted by the cue's log-odds validity. If the accumulated evidence crosses a latent decision threshold, search stops and a choice is made immediately. If all cues are exhausted without crossing the threshold, the decision defaults to the accumulated tally. This bridges Take The Best (TTB) and Weighted Additive (WADD) models: a low threshold mimics TTB by stopping at the first discriminating cue, while a high threshold mimics WADD by integrating all cues.

`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- threshold: [0.0, 4.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, I tightened the 'threshold' parameter range from [0.0, 10.0] to [0.0, 4.0] to encourage earlier stopping and better capture TTB-like behavior in Experiment 3. I also restricted 'epsilon' to [0.0, 0.5] to prevent excessive reliance on uniform noise.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1661 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2277 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1661.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Sequential Evidence Accumulation model captures some aspects of the data well (e.g., Experiments 1, 2, and 6) and was accepted by the loop, improving the baseline loss. However, it severely underpredicts the Take-The-Best (TTB) match rate in Experiment 3 (predicted 0.3629 vs. observed 0.6950). It also overpredicts the response mean in Experiment 4 and the WADD consistency in Experiment 5. The low TTB match rate suggests that the model is not stopping early enough, likely because the 'threshold' parameter's upper bound (10.0) is too high relative to the log-odds weights of single cues (which typically max out around 2-3 for validities like 0.9).
Rationale: To improve the TTB match rate in Experiment 3 without losing the compensatory ability needed for other experiments, tighten the 'threshold' parameter range from [0.0, 10.0] to [0.0, 4.0]. This will force the model to consider early stopping more frequently when the first cue is highly valid. Additionally, restrict 'epsilon' to [0.0, 0.5] to prevent the model from relying on excessive uniform noise to fit difficult trials.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1661 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2277 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The current candidate was REJECTED by the loop, as its aggregate loss (0.2277) was worse than the running best from iteration 1 (0.1661). My previous advice to tighten the threshold to [0.0, 4.0] and restrict epsilon backfired, likely because the log-odds transformation creates extreme weight values (e.g., log(0.9999/0.0001) ~ 9.2) that interact poorly with a hard-capped threshold, disrupting the delicate balance needed for Experiments 1, 2, and 6. The base model still underpredicts Take-The-Best behavior in Experiment 3 (0.3629 vs 0.6950) and overpredicts WADD consistency in Experiment 5 (0.6119 vs 0.5000).",

  "rationale": "Since restricting the threshold range while keeping log-odds weights degraded performance, we should try a different in-family adjustment on the accepted base. Instead of log-odds, use the raw validities (or validities minus 0.5) as the weights for evidence accumulation, and adjust the threshold range to [0.0, 2.0]. This prevents extreme weight values from dominating the tally and provides a smoother, more predictable accumulation process. Keep epsilon's range wide (e.g., [0.0, 1.0]) to allow the model to capture the high variance and guessing behavior in highly conflicting trials."
