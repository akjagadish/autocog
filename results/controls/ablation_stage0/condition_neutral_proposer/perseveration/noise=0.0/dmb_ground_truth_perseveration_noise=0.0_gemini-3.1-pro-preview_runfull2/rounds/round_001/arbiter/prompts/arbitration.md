# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_3") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_3
People evaluate options using a non-linearly Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy. Each option's value is the sum of its features weighted by their perceived importance, which is a non-linear power function of the objective cue validities. This allows a single high-validity cue to balance out multiple lower-validity cues, resulting in compensatory trade-offs and choice probabilities near 0.5 on conflict trials.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=12):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 9: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 10: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 11: A=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 12: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To distinguish the strictly non-compensatory Take The Best (TTB) from the Non-linearly Weighted Additive (WADD) model, we use a 5-feature design with a linear spread of validities. TTB relies entirely on the single highest-validity discriminating cue, ignoring all lower-validity cues. WADD, depending on its gamma parameter, can exhibit compensatory behavior where multiple lower-validity cues can outweigh a single higher-validity cue. By pitting the most valid discriminating cue against varying numbers of lower-validity cues, we can observe whether choices flip (indicating low-gamma WADD) or remain steadfast (indicating TTB or high-gamma WADD). Furthermore, because WADD computes a continuous difference in weighted sums, its choice probabilities (via softmax) will vary across trials depending on the margin of the weighted sum, whereas TTB's choice probabilities depend solely on the binary output of the single discriminating cue, yielding constant confidence across all trials where a cue discriminates.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
To maximally discriminate Take The Best (TTB) from Weighted Additive (WADD) models, we isolate 'conflict trials' where the single best discriminating cue points to one option, but the sum of all lower-validity cues points to the other. TTB will consistently choose the option favored by the best cue (yielding a metric near 1.0), whereas WADD (particularly at lower values of gamma) will compensate and choose the other option, drastically lowering its match rate with TTB's predictions. By focusing exclusively on these conflict trials, we amplify the divergence between the two theories and suppress noise from trials where both models agree.

**Trial pairs (n=10):**

  trial 10: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design tests a core quantitative divergence between Take The Best (TTB) and the Non-linearly Weighted Additive (WADD) model: sensitivity to the margin of evidence. Across all trials, Option A is favored by the single most valid cue (validity 0.95), while Option B is favored by an increasing number of lower-validity cues, or Option A is favored by an increasing number of supporting cues. Because TTB stops at the first discriminating cue, it predicts identical choice probabilities for Option A across all these trials (a flat line, as the binary TTB score difference is always 1). In contrast, WADD computes a continuous weighted sum, so it predicts a monotonically increasing probability of choosing Option A as the net evidence shifts from strongly favoring B (despite losing the top cue) to strongly favoring A. This provides a stark quantitative dissociation: flat vs. graded choice probabilities.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
The metric computes the covariance between the relative number of supporting cues (sum of A's features minus sum of B's features) and the probability of choosing Option A. For Take The Best (TTB), the choice is determined entirely by the first cue, which always favors A in this design. Thus, TTB predicts a flat probability of choosing A across all trials, yielding a covariance near zero. In contrast, the Weighted Additive (WADD) model integrates all cues, so the probability of choosing A increases monotonically as the net number of supporting cues shifts in A's favor, yielding a strongly positive covariance.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The data presents a classic paradox in multi-attribute decision making. In Experiment 2, the observed covariance between the net supporting cues and the probability of choosing Option A is exactly 0.0000, which perfectly matches the non-compensatory Take The Best (TTB) theory (pi_1) and completely falsifies the Weighted Additive (WADD) theory (pi_3). This suggests subjects consistently chose the option favored by the top cue regardless of the opposing cue count. However, in Experiments 1, 3, and 4, the metrics isolate 'conflict' trials and show that the proportion of TTB-consistent choices is around 40-50%. TTB strongly overpredicts (or underpredicts, depending on the metric orientation) these match rates, while WADD predicts values much closer to the observed 0.5 mark. Neither a pure TTB nor a pure WADD model can explain both the strict non-compensatory behavior in Experiment 2 and the highly mixed behavior in the conflict trials of the other experiments.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Strategy Mixture' or 'Probabilistic Strategy Selection' theory. Instead of assuming all subjects use a single strategy (either pure TTB or pure WADD), this theory should posit that the population consists of a mixture of decision-makers: some rely on a non-compensatory heuristic (TTB) while others use a compensatory strategy (like Tallying or WADD), or individuals probabilistically switch strategies trial-by-trial based on choice difficulty. A mixture model can capture the ~50% alignment rates in conflict trials (by averaging across the population) while potentially accommodating the flat choice probability curves in specific boundary designs like Experiment 2 if the compensatory subset's behavior cancels out or if strategy selection is context-dependent."
