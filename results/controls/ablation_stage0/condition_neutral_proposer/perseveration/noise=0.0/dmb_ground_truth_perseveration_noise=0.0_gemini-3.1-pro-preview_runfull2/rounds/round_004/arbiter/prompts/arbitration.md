# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Constant-Mixture Strategy Selection with dampened Tallying: Decision-makers evaluate options using a probabilistic mixture of a non-compensatory strategy (Take-The-Best) and a compensatory strategy (Tallying). Individuals have a fixed, trait-like probability of using TTB versus Tallying on any given trial, independent of cue depth. To account for zero covariance between tally score differences and choices in certain environments, the temperature parameter for the Tallying component can reach zero, dampening its linear tracking of score differences.

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Pure Take-The-Best (Lexicographic) Decision Making: Subjects deterministically choose the option favored by the single most valid cue that discriminates between the two options. They do not use compensatory weighting and do not mix strategies. Choices are governed entirely by the highest-validity differing cue, with a near-zero lapse rate.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_5)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To distinguish Theory 1 (Constant-Mixture of Take-The-Best and Tallying) from Theory 2 (Pure Take-The-Best), this design systematically varies the predictions of the Tallying component while holding the TTB prediction constant. Across the trials, Option A is consistently favored by the highest-validity discriminating cue (so TTB always chooses A). However, the number of lower-validity cues favoring Option B varies from 4 (strongly favoring B in Tallying) down to 1 (strongly favoring A in Tallying). Theory 2 predicts a constant, near-100% probability of choosing Option A across all these trials because it relies purely on the single best discriminating cue. Theory 1, which mixes TTB with Tallying, predicts a monotonically increasing probability of choosing Option A as the Tallying score shifts from favoring B to favoring A.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
In the experimental design, Option A is always favored by the most valid discriminating cue (Take-The-Best always chooses A). However, on half of the trial types, Option B is favored by a simple tally of positive cues (Tallying favors B). Theory 2 (Pure TTB) predicts subjects will almost always choose Option A (response = 0) on these trials. Theory 1 (Mixture of TTB and Tallying) predicts a higher rate of choosing Option B (response = 1) because the Tallying component pulls the decision towards B. This metric calculates the proportion of times subjects choose Option B on trials where Tallying favors B, which will be near 0 for Theory 2 and significantly greater than 0 for Theory 1.

## EXPERIMENT 2 (proposed by pi_6)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** To maximally distinguish Theory 1 (Pure Take-The-Best) from Theory 2 (Constant-Mixture of TTB and Tallying), we hold the TTB prediction strictly constant while systematically sweeping the Tallying score difference from strongly opposing TTB to strongly supporting TTB. Across all trials, Option A wins on the highest-validity cue (so TTB always deterministically favors A). However, the number of remaining cues favoring Option A versus Option B shifts progressively. Theory 1 predicts a completely flat, near-100% probability of choosing Option A across all trials, as it relies solely on the single best discriminating cue and ignores the rest. Theory 2 predicts a monotonically increasing probability of choosing Option A across the sequence, as the Tallying component shifts from pulling the choice towards Option B to pushing it towards Option A.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
Theory 1 (Pure Take-The-Best) predicts that subjects will consistently choose Option A across all trials because Option A always wins on the most valid cue, regardless of the remaining cues. Thus, the choice response (0 for A, 1 for B) should be near 0 universally, resulting in a near-zero covariance with the number of cues favoring Option A. Theory 2 (Constant-Mixture) predicts that as the number of cues favoring Option A increases (from 1 to 6), the compensatory Tallying component increasingly favors Option A, reducing the probability of choosing Option B. This creates a strong negative covariance between the sum of Option A's cues and the response.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across almost all experiments, the observed metrics are either exactly 0.0000 (Exp 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) or very close to 0.5 for match rates (Exp 3, 4, 5). In Exp 1, the observed value is 0.60, but with a massive variance of 0.24. This overwhelming pattern of zero covariances, zero differences, and ~50% match rates strongly implies that subjects are not systematically employing either Take-The-Best (pi_6) or a TTB/Tallying mixture (pi_5). Instead, their choices appear to be largely random or driven by idiosyncratic noise that cancels out in aggregate. Neither theory currently accommodates this reality well, as both predict strong systematic deviations from random guessing.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 2,
  "recommendation": "Propose a 'Random Choice / High-Lapse' theory. The theory should posit that due to task complexity, lack of motivation, or cognitive overload, subjects largely guess between the two options. The model should have a very high base lapse rate (e.g., epsilon near 1.0) or simply predict a 50/50 probability for all trials, effectively capturing the zero covariances and 0.5 match rates observed across the experimental suite."
