# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Propose a Strategy Mixture Theory. Instead of assuming a single monolithic decision rule for all participants, posit that the population consists of a mixture of strategies (or individuals probabilistically select between them). Specifically, a proportion 'alpha' of decisions are made using a non-compensatory heuristic (like TTB), while the remaining '1 - alpha' are made using a compensatory strategy (like WADD or Tallying). This mixture approach will naturally capture the intermediate rates of compensatory choices and TTB-consistency observed across the experiments.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Strategy Mixture Theory (TTB + WADD): Decision makers do not universally adopt a single monolithic strategy. Instead, choices are generated from a probabilistic mixture of decision rules. On any given trial, an individual uses a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) with probability 'alpha', and a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive - WADD) with probability '1 - alpha'. Mixing these strategies captures intermediate rates of compensatory and non-compensatory choices, while WADD leverages cue validities for a more nuanced compensatory evaluation.

`parameters`:
- alpha: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, I swapped the compensatory component of the mixture from Tallying to WADD (Weighted Additive, calculated as the dot product of features and validities) to better capture nuanced compensatory behavior that respects cue validities. I also tightened the epsilon parameter range to [0.0, 0.2] to prevent the over-flattening of choice probabilities toward 0.5 that was observed in the previous model.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4103 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3786 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3786.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate Strategy Mixture Theory was accepted, but its predictions are hovering around 0.5 across all experiments. While the observed data shows a strong, but not perfect, preference for non-compensatory (TTB-like) choices (e.g., Exp 1: 0.65, Exp 3: 0.22 compensatory), the current mixture model under-predicts TTB consistency (0.46) and over-predicts compensatory choices (0.53). This flattening of predictions suggests the model is either relying too heavily on the lapse rate (epsilon) or that Tallying is too crude a compensatory strategy to capture the secondary variance in choices.
Rationale: Keep the Strategy Mixture framework (as prescribed by the arbiter), but make two minor adjustments to improve fit: 1) Swap the compensatory component from Tallying to WADD (Weighted Additive, where scores are the dot product of features and validities), which uses the cue validities and may better capture the nuanced compensatory behavior. 2) Tighten the `epsilon` parameter range to [0.0, 0.2] or remove it entirely, as the current upper bound [0.0, 0.5] combined with the mixture is likely over-flattening the choice probabilities toward 0.5.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4103 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3786 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate model's loss improved, validating the shift from Tallying to WADD and the tightening of epsilon. However, the predictions across all experiments are still hovering too close to 0.5. The empirical data strongly favors non-compensatory choices (e.g., Exp 1 real TTB consistency is 0.65; Exp 3 compensatory choice rate is only 0.22). The current parameter ranges allow `alpha` (the probability of using TTB) to vary uniformly between 0.0 and 1.0, which pulls the aggregate predictions toward an even split between TTB and WADD. Because the data shows a dominant preference for TTB-like behavior with only occasional compensatory deviations, the mixture should be biased toward TTB.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the TTB + WADD mixture framework, but adjust the parameter bounds to reflect the strong empirical bias toward non-compensatory strategies. Specifically, shift the `alpha` range from [0.0, 1.0] to [0.5, 1.0] so the model predominantly relies on TTB while allowing WADD to capture the secondary variance. Additionally, consider increasing the lower bound of `beta` (e.g., [1.0, 20.0]) to reduce the baseline noise in the softmax functions, ensuring that when a strategy strongly favors an option, the resulting probability is sharp rather than diffuse."
