# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** Theory 1 is described as a rank-dependent tallying model, but its mathematical parameterization (gamma >= 2.0) ensures that the weight of the highest-ranked feature (1.0) is strictly greater than the sum of all subsequent feature weights combined (which maxes out at ~0.645 for gamma=2.0). Thus, Theory 1 acts as a deterministic, non-compensatory lexicographic model (pure TTB-like behavior). Theory 2, however, is a probabilistic mixture of TTB and a Linear Weighted Additive rule (WADD). Because Linear WADD uses raw validities as weights, it is strongly compensatory: the sum of several moderate validities easily exceeds a single high validity. By pitting the highest-validity discriminating cue against multiple lower-validity cues, we can cleanly separate the two theories: Theory 1 will uniformly choose the option favored by the single best cue, while Theory 2 will exhibit a mixed response profile reflecting its compensatory WADD component.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Rank-Dependent Tallying: Decision-makers primarily evaluate options based on the sheer number of positive features (a tallying-like process), but the weight of each feature is subject to rank-based discounting. Rather than scaling exponentially with log-odds, a feature's weight decays as a power law of its validity rank. This ensures a strong compensatory mechanism where multiple moderate cues can easily overpower a single high-validity cue, and tallying differences dominate choice probabilities unless the validity rank differences are extreme.

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [2.0, 8.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**

        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]

    # Assign ranks to features based on validity (1 = highest validity)
    n_features = len(val)
    order = np.argsort(-val, kind="stable")
    ranks = np.zeros(n_features)
    ranks[order] = np.arange(1, n_features + 1)
    
    # Rank-based discounting: weight decays as an inverse power of rank
    w = 1.0 / (ranks ** gamma)

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Strategy Mixture Theory (TTB + WADD): Decision makers do not universally adopt a single monolithic strategy. Instead, choices are generated from a probabilistic mixture of decision rules. On any given trial, an individual uses a non-compensatory heuristic (Take The Best) with probability 'alpha', and a compensatory strategy (Weighted Additive - WADD) with probability '1 - alpha'. Mixing these strategies captures intermediate rates of compensatory and non-compensatory choices, while WADD leverages cue validities for a more nuanced compensatory evaluation.

**Parameters:**
- alpha: [0.5, 1.0]
- beta: [1.0, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]
- validities: validities

        z_ttb = beta * (scores_ttb - scores_ttb.max())
        e_ttb = np.exp(z_ttb)

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
