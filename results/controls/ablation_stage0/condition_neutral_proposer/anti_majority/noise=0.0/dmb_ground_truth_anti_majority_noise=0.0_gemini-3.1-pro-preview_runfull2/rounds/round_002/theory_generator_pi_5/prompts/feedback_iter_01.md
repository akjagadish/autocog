# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Propose a new theory based on a 'Lexicographic Semiorder' or 'Cue Difference Threshold' model. In this theory, decision-makers compare options cue-by-cue in order of validity. However, instead of a strict TTB rule, an option is only chosen if the validity of its cue exceeds the alternative by a certain threshold, or if the sheer number of opposing cues doesn't cross a 'tallying deficit' limit. If the top cue's advantage is not seen as decisive enough (e.g., when facing a concentrated block of moderately high cues), they fall back to a compensatory or tallying process. This can explain the non-monotonic preference reversals seen in Experiments 1 and 2 where extreme cue configurations lead to counterintuitive choice rates.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Cue Difference Threshold Theory with Evidence-Weighted Fallback: Decision-makers evaluate options lexicographically but demand that the best discriminating cue provides a decisive advantage. A cue is deemed decisive if its validity exceeds the best opposing cue by a sufficient threshold, or if the total weight of opposing evidence (sum of log-odds of opposing cues) is below a deficit threshold. If the top cue's advantage is challenged by a sufficiently heavy block of opposing evidence, the decision-maker abandons the non-compensatory heuristic and falls back to a fully compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) process using unnormalized log-odds to resolve the choice.

- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Addressed the critic's feedback by redefining the tallying deficit to use the continuous weight of opposing evidence (sum of log-odds of opposing cues) instead of a strict cue count. This allows the model to differentiate between trials where opposing cues are weak vs. strong, correctly capturing why TTB is abandoned more readily in Experiment 6's Trial 7 than Trial 36. Additionally, the fallback WADD scores are now calculated using raw unnormalized log-odds differences, preserving the confidence of the compensatory strategy when evidence is strong. TTB scores are scaled by the sum of log-odds to maintain their 'decisive' nature relative to WADD.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3234 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3351 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3234.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory was accepted by the loop, indicating an improvement in the aggregate loss (now 0.3234). It fits Experiments 1 and 3 well, and shows sensible improvements on Experiments 2 and 4. However, it fails to capture the correct direction for Experiment 6 (real is -0.1983, candidate is +0.2408) and underestimates the magnitude of Experiment 5 (real is -0.39, candidate is -0.02). In Experiment 6, the model predicts higher TTB-consistency on Trial 7 than Trial 36, whereas human data shows the opposite. This suggests the current 'deficit_limit' logic (simply counting opposing cues) makes Trial 7 look 'safer' for TTB than Trial 36, failing to capture why human subjects abandon TTB more readily or choose the compensatory option more frequently in Trial 7.
Rationale: While the current candidate is the running best, the fallback trigger logic needs a minor adjustment within the prescribed family to fix the inverted effect in Experiment 6. Instead of a strict count of opposing cues (`num_opposing`), redefine the 'deficit' to consider the continuous weight of the opposing evidence (e.g., the sum of validities of opposing cues, or the compensatory score difference). Additionally, ensure the compensatory WADD scores are scaled properly (e.g., using raw log-odds differences rather than normalizing by `total_w`, which flattens the confidence of the fallback strategy). Adjusting the deficit definition to be validity-weighted and fixing the WADD scaling should allow the model to capture the correct direction in Experiments 5 and 6 without abandoning the Lexicographic Semiorder family.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3234 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3351 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate was REJECTED by the gate because its aggregate loss worsened (0.3351 vs 0.3234). The attempt to redefine the 'deficit' using the sum of log-odds of opposing cues exacerbated the mismatch in Experiment 6, pushing the metric to +0.4067 (real is -0.1983). In Experiment 6, humans are less TTB-consistent on Trial 7 than Trial 36, which is counter-intuitive if we assume a strict WADD or log-odds based fallback, since Trial 36 has more opposing evidence against the TTB winner than Trial 7. The previous advice to use validity-weighted evidence for the deficit limit failed to capture this and was rightfully rejected.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since the log-odds deficit approach was rejected, we should return to the simpler 'sheer number of opposing cues' (tallying deficit) logic from the accepted Iteration 1 base. To improve the fit on Experiments 5 and 6 without breaking the family, change the fallback strategy itself: instead of falling back to a fully compensatory WADD process, fall back to a simple Tallying process (unweighted sum of cues). The arbiter explicitly suggested 'fall back to a compensatory or tallying process'. Using Tallying for the fallback scores (i.e., simply counting the number of positive features for each option) might better capture the non-monotonic preference reversals and the specific trial differences in Experiments 5 and 6. Ensure the Tallying scores are properly scaled by `beta` in the softmax."
