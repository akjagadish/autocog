# Round 0 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 2 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    # row 1 = option B. Cue cascade: features are consulted in order
    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.

            winner = 1
            break

    if winner is None:
        # No discriminating cue — pure guess.
        return np.ones(2) / 2.0

### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`

    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.

            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When

## Replacement

### `pi_3` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** The Weighted Additive (WADD) model with non-linear weight scaling posits that decision makers integrate all available information by computing a weighted sum of features. However, the weighting of cues is not strictly proportional to their log-odds validity. Instead, decision makers apply a non-linear transformation (parameterized by gamma) to the log-odds, allowing them to stretch the weight differential. This permits WADD to approximate lexicographic (TTB-like) choice when gamma > 1, or more uniform (Tallying-like) weighting when gamma < 1, while remaining a fully compensatory integration process.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, we constrained the upper bounds of both `gamma` and `beta`. The previous `gamma` range up to 5.0 allowed the weights to stretch so much that the model over-predicted TTB consistency in Experiment 1. By restricting `gamma` to [0.5, 2.5] and `beta` to [0.1, 10.0], the model is prevented from collapsing into an overly deterministic lexicographic strategy, softening the predictions to better match the empirical mixture of compensatory and non-compensatory behaviors.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 10.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.5, 2.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]

    # Transform validities to log-odds weights, clipping to avoid infinity
    val_clipped = np.clip(val, 0.5001, 0.9999)
    log_odds = np.log(val_clipped / (1.0 - val_clipped))
    
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
