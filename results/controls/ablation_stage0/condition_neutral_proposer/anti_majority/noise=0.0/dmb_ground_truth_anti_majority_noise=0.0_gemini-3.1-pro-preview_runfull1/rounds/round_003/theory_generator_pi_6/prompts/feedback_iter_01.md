# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Propose a brand-new theory based on 'Variance Penalization' or 'Risk Aversion' in cue integration. The theory should posit that subjects do not just sum validities (linearly or non-linearly), but actively penalize options that rely on highly dispersed or extreme expert ratings. An option with moderate, consistent validities is perceived as more reliable than one with a mix of very high and very low validities. This would naturally explain the strong preference for moderate validities in tied-sum scenarios (Exp 1 and 8) and could help explain the anomalous behavior in Exp 7.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Variance Penalization (Risk Aversion in Cue Integration): Subjects evaluate options by integrating the validities of present features, but they actively penalize options that rely on highly dispersed or extreme expert ratings. An option with moderate, consistent validities is perceived as more reliable than one with a mix of very high and very low validities. The subjective value of an option is its non-linearly weighted sum of validities minus a penalty proportional to the standard deviation of its active validities, which scales appropriately to strongly influence decisions.

- lambda_pen: [0.0, 100.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice, the penalty term has been changed from variance to standard deviation (`np.std`). Because validities range from 0.5 to 1.0, variance is very small (~0.01), limiting the impact of the penalty. Standard deviation provides a linearly-scaled dispersion measure that can more effectively compete with the weighted sum. Additionally, the upper bound of `lambda_pen` has been increased to 100.0 to allow the risk-aversion component to strongly dominate the choice when necessary, helping to explain the strong deviations observed in Experiments 5, 7, and 8.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4369 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1770 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1770.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate theory 'Variance Penalization' introduces a penalty for the variance of active cues, which helps it capture the preference for moderate options in tied-sum scenarios (Exp 6). It achieved a new running-best loss, indicating the mechanism is promising. However, it still falls short on key experiments: in Exp 5 and 7, it fails to match the strong empirical deviations from compensatory summation, and in Exp 8 it severely underestimates the deviations from 0.5. A major reason for this is likely the scale of the penalty: because validities are typically bounded between 0.5 and 1.0, their variance is on the order of 0.01. A lambda_pen max of 20.0 only yields a maximum penalty of ~0.2, which is often overpowered by the main sum, especially when gamma > 1.
Rationale: To strengthen the prescribed mechanism family, make two adjustments: 1) Replace the variance penalty with a standard deviation penalty (`np.std(val[active_mask])`), which scales linearly with the validities and produces larger penalty magnitudes. 2) Expand the upper bound of `lambda_pen` significantly (e.g., up to 50.0 or 100.0) to allow the risk-aversion component to dominate when necessary. Keep the rest of the mechanism (including the gamma exponent) intact.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4369 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1770 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The revised candidate replacing variance with standard deviation and increasing the upper bound of `lambda_pen` has achieved a remarkable reduction in aggregate loss (from 0.4369 to 0.1770). The model now captures the deviations in Experiment 7 (0.1542 vs real 0.1450) and Experiment 8 (0.3667 vs real 0.3517) exceptionally well, demonstrating that a strongly parameterized risk-aversion/dispersion penalty is precisely the mechanism needed to explain the preference for moderate, consistent validities over extreme ones. Fits on Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4 are also very close to the human ground truth. While there is still a mismatch in Experiment 5, the overall performance across the suite of experiments is excellent and validates the theoretical direction.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The current theory beautifully captures the majority of the variance across the experiments, successfully leveraging the standard deviation penalty to explain tied-sum scenarios and deviations from simple compensatory or lexicographic rules. The mechanism is mathematically sound, the parameter ranges are well-calibrated, and the aggregate loss is low enough to accept this as a successful candidate."
