# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_4`).

Propose a fundamentally different theory of multi-attribute choice, such as a Configural Weighting model or a Heuristic-Switching model based on the variance of the cues. The new theory should account for why subjects might systematically prefer options with 'moderate' validities or even systematically violate validity-based dominance (as seen in Experiment 1). Consider mechanisms where the subjective weight of a cue is context-dependent (e.g., depends on the presence of other cues) or where subjects use a two-stage process: first comparing the total number of positive features (tallying), and only using validities to break ties or when the difference in counts is small.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Two-Stage Heuristic-Switching: Decision makers first evaluate options by comparing the simple tally of positive features. If the difference in the number of positive features between options exceeds a subjective threshold, the decision is made purely on this tally (ignoring validities). However, if the options are tied or near-tied in their feature counts (difference is within the threshold), decision makers switch to a compensatory strategy, weighing the features by their validities to break the tie.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    theta = float(parameters["theta"])
    
    count_a = np.sum(a)
    count_b = np.sum(b)

        scores = np.array([count_a, count_b])

    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)

`parameters`:
- theta: [0.0, 3.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's advice to pivot to the two-stage Heuristic-Switching model (as the previous configural weighting tweaks worsened the fit and were rejected), this model implements the alternative mechanism suggested by the arbiter. Subjects first compare the total number of positive features (tallying). If the absolute difference in counts exceeds a threshold `theta`, the decision is based on tallying. If the difference is less than or equal to `theta` (a tie or near-tie), the subject switches to using a linear sum of validities to break the tie. This necessitates a rewrite from the previous configural model, but directly instantiates the arbiter's suggested mechanism to capture systematic violations of validity-based dominance.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.4671 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.7455 -> REJECTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.7297 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4671.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The proposed Configural Weighting model with Validity-Proportional Discounting was accepted by the loop, establishing a new baseline. However, its predictions are clustering around 0.5 across most experiments (e.g., Exp 1: 0.34 vs 0.78, Exp 5: 0.55 vs 0.11, Exp 6: 0.48 vs 0.65). This suggests that the model is either being washed out by a high upper bound on the lapse rate (epsilon), or that the configural term (omega) is scaling too aggressively and dominating the linear term in unpredictable ways, causing the choice probabilities to become highly variable and effectively random when averaged across the parameter space.
Rationale: Keep the Configural Weighting family prescribed by the arbiter, but make minor adjustments to improve fit. First, constrain the `epsilon` parameter range to [0.0, 0.2] to prevent the model from washing out strong predictions. Second, reconsider the scaling of the configural penalty. Currently, `0.5 * (sum^2 - sum_sq)` scales quadratically with the number of cues, which might overwhelm the linear term for options with many cues. Try normalizing the configural term by the number of active cues, or using the variance of the active validities (as hinted by the arbiter) to control the penalty/synergy. Finally, ensure `omega` has a slightly tighter range (e.g., [-2.0, 2.0]) to prevent it from completely overriding the linear validity sum.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.4671 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.7455 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate was rejected by the accept gate, meaning the attempt to normalize the configural penalty and tighten parameters worsened the fit (loss increased from 0.4671 to 0.7455). Looking at the accepted base (iter 1), the predictions across all experiments hover around 0.5, failing to capture the strong empirical preferences in Exp 1 (real 0.78), Exp 2 (real 0.23), and Exp 4 (real 0.22). The configural weighting approach is struggling to differentiate the choices robustly without washing out.
Rationale: Since tweaking the configural weighting terms worsened the loss, let's pivot to the other mechanism explicitly suggested in the arbiter's recommendation: the two-stage Heuristic-Switching model. Implement a model where subjects first compare the total number of positive features (tallying). If the absolute difference in tally counts is greater than a threshold (e.g., a free parameter `theta` in [0, 2]), the subject chooses based on tallying. If the difference is less than or equal to `theta` (i.e., a tie or near-tie in counts), the subject switches to using the validities (either a linear sum of validities, or Take-The-Best) to break the tie. Use a softmax over the resulting evidence or a mixture model to generate probabilities. This directly addresses the arbiter's prompt and may naturally capture the systematic violations of validity-based dominance seen in the data.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.7455 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.7297 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The two-stage tallying-first heuristic model was rejected by the gate, as it severely missed the empirical patterns across all experiments (e.g., predicting 0.14 vs real 0.78 in Exp 1, and 0.85 vs real 0.23 in Exp 2). The loop will now revert to the accepted base from Iteration 1 (the configural weighting model). The configural model from Iter 1 achieved a better loss (0.4671) but its predictions were still clustering around 0.5. Since our previous attempt to fix it by normalizing the penalty failed, we need a different approach within the context-dependent/configural family.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Since the Tallying-first switching model was rejected, the loop resets to the Iter 1 configural base. To improve the configural model without overcomplicating the penalty term (which caused Iter 2 to fail), implement a simpler context-dependent weighting mechanism: Diminishing Returns or Attention-Sharing. For instance, let the subjective value of an option be the sum of its validities divided by the number of positive features raised to a free parameter `alpha` (e.g., `score = sum(validities) / (count ** alpha)` with alpha in [0.0, 2.0]). Alternatively, use a simple fractional power `score = sum(validities ** gamma)`. This directly fulfills the arbiter's suggestion of context-dependent subjective weights while keeping the math stable and avoiding the quadratic blowups that likely ruined the previous configural attempts. Keep epsilon constrained to [0.0, 0.2] to prevent washing out."
