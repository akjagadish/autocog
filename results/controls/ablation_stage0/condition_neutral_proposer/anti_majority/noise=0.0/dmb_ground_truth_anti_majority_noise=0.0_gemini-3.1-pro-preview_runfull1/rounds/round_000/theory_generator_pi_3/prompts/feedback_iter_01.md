# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Propose a Weighted Additive (WADD) theory as a new competitor. Unlike Tallying (which ignores validities) and TTB (which is strictly non-compensatory), WADD computes a weighted sum of feature differences using the cue validities as weights. This allows for compensatory decision-making where multiple lower-validity cues might occasionally override a single high-validity cue, potentially capturing the slight deviations from pure TTB observed in the real data.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
People make decisions by computing a weighted sum of the features for each option, using the cue validities scaled by an exponent as the weights. Unlike Take The Best, which is strictly non-compensatory, the Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy integrates all available information. However, by scaling validities with an exponent (gamma), the model can flexibly capture varying degrees of compensatoriness, ranging from equal-weighting (Tallying) to highly skewed weighting that approximates one-reason decision making (TTB). Choice probabilities are generated via a softmax over the weighted sums, combined with a uniform lapse rate to account for random errors.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    weights = val ** gamma
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(weights * a)
    score_b = np.sum(weights * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Added a 'gamma' parameter to exponentiate the cue validities. Raw cue validities made the model overly compensatory (too similar to Tallying), whereas human data on critical trials leans heavily toward Take The Best. Exponentiating the validities allows the model to learn highly skewed weights (at high gamma), enabling it to bridge the gap between compensatory and non-compensatory decision making.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.8614 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3975 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.3975.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate implements a Weighted Additive (WADD) model using raw cue validities as weights. However, the simulation results show that this formulation behaves far too much like Tallying. In both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, the metrics isolate trials where TTB and Tallying make opposite predictions. In both cases, human data strongly favors the TTB prediction (Exp 1: 78.6% TTB; Exp 2: 23% Tallying / 77% TTB). The candidate model, by contrast, strongly favors the Tallying prediction (Exp 1: 16% TTB; Exp 2: 85% Tallying). This happens because the sum of multiple lower raw validities easily exceeds a single high validity, making the model overly compensatory compared to human behavior.
Rationale: To remain within the WADD family while capturing the human tendency to lean closer to TTB, the model needs a mechanism to scale the relative importance of the validities. Introduce a new free parameter `gamma` (e.g., range [0.1, 10.0]) and compute the weights as `weights = validities ** gamma`. A high `gamma` will make the weights highly skewed (approximating TTB), a `gamma` of 0 approximates Tallying, and `gamma=1` recovers the current model. This will allow the optimization process to find the correct degree of compensatoriness to match the empirical data.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.8614 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.3975 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The addition of the gamma parameter successfully shifted the model's predictions toward the empirical data (increasing TTB-like behavior), which was accepted by the gate and significantly improved the aggregate loss. However, the model still falls short of the strong TTB preference observed in human subjects (Exp 1 TTB choices: 0.55 simulated vs 0.78 real; Exp 2 Tallying choices: 0.57 simulated vs 0.23 real). The model is still too compensatory or too noisy on critical trials.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The model is likely artificially bounded by its parameter ranges. Because cue validities are less than 1, exponentiating them by a high `gamma` results in very small absolute weights. To produce sharp, deterministic choice probabilities from these small weighted-sum differences, the softmax inverse temperature (`beta`) must be correspondingly very large. Increase the upper bound of `gamma` (e.g., to 20.0 or 50.0) to allow for even stronger non-compensatory weighting, and significantly increase the upper bound of `beta` (e.g., to 100.0 or 200.0) so the model can confidently execute those skewed weights without washing out into noise. Keep the exact same WADD mechanism."
