# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=4):** [0.95, 0.85, 0.65, 0.55]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1]

**Rationale:** To maximally distinguish the exponent-scaled Weighted Additive model (THEORY 1) from the Variance Penalization model (THEORY 2), we use 'dilution' trials. In THEORY 1, adding any active feature strictly increases an option's value because all validities are positive. In THEORY 2, adding a low-validity feature to a high-validity feature increases the standard deviation of active validities, which incurs a penalty that can decrease the option's total value. We pit options with a single high-validity feature against options with that same feature plus a low-validity feature. THEORY 1 will always prefer the option with more features, while THEORY 2 can strongly prefer the option with fewer features. We also include pairs with tied linear sums but different variances to separate the non-linear scaling of validities (THEORY 1) from the explicit variance penalty (THEORY 2).

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People make decisions by computing a weighted sum of the features for each option, using the cue validities scaled by an exponent as the weights. Unlike Take The Best, which is strictly non-compensatory, the Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy integrates all available information. However, by scaling validities with an exponent (gamma), the model can flexibly capture varying degrees of compensatoriness, ranging from equal-weighting (Tallying) to highly skewed weighting that approximates one-reason decision making (TTB). Choice probabilities are generated via a softmax over the weighted sums, combined with a uniform lapse rate to account for random errors.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 200.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- gamma: [0.1, 50.0]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    weights = val ** gamma
    
    # Compute weighted sum of features for each option
    score_a = np.sum(weights * a)
    score_b = np.sum(weights * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Variance Penalization (Risk Aversion in Cue Integration): Subjects evaluate options by integrating the validities of present features, but they actively penalize options that rely on highly dispersed or extreme expert ratings. An option with moderate, consistent validities is perceived as more reliable than one with a mix of very high and very low validities. The subjective value of an option is its non-linearly weighted sum of validities minus a penalty proportional to the standard deviation of its active validities, which scales appropriately to strongly influence decisions.

**Parameters:**
- gamma: [0.1, 10.0]
- lambda_pen: [0.0, 100.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]

        # Weighted sum using exponentiated validities for compensatoriness flexibility

        # Standard deviation penalty using original validities to capture dispersion

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This metric calculates the proportion of times a subject chooses Option B over Option A when B is a strict superset of A (specifically, adding the lowest-validity 4th feature). According to the Weighted Additive model (THEORY 1), adding any feature strictly increases an option's value, so subjects should consistently prefer B. According to the Variance Penalization model (THEORY 2), adding a low-validity feature to a high-validity feature increases the variance of active features, which incurs a penalty. Thus, THEORY 2 predicts a much lower preference for B (and potentially a preference for A) on these specific trials."
