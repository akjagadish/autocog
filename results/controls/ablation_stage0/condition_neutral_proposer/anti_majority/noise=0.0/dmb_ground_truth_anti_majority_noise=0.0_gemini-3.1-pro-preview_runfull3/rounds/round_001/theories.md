# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**

    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)

        raise ValueError(

            winner = 1
            break

    if winner is None:
        # No discriminating cue — pure guess.
        return np.ones(2) / 2.0

```


### slot 2 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People use a Weighted Additive (WADD) strategy to make decisions, where each feature is weighted by its subjective importance (a non-linear transformation of its validity). The total score for an option is the sum of the weighted features it possesses. This compensatory mechanism allows multiple lower-validity cues to sometimes outweigh a single high-validity cue, naturally interpolating between Take The Best (when validity differences are heavily magnified) and Tallying (when validities are ignored). Response noise and lapses account for stochasticity in choice.

**Rationale:** Following the critic's advice, I kept the Weighted Additive (WADD) model exactly as it was, but widened the upper bounds for the `gamma` and `beta` parameters. Increasing `gamma`'s upper bound to 30.0 allows the model to approximate lexicographic weighting (Take The Best) more closely when needed, while increasing `beta`'s upper bound to 50.0 allows for more deterministic responding. This should help the model better capture the higher TTB consistency observed in Experiment 1 without losing its accurate fit on Experiment 2.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 50.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `gamma`: `[0.0, 30.0]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    
    # Transform validities into subjective weights using a power function.
    # gamma = 0 yields equal weights (Tallying); gamma -> inf yields lexicographic weights (Take The Best).
    weights = val ** gamma
    
    # Compute weighted additive scores for each option
    score_a = np.sum(weights * a)
    score_b = np.sum(weights * b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax choice rule
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** People possess an adaptive toolbox of decision heuristics, primarily Take The Best (TTB) and Tallying, and select among them probabilistically. TTB is a non-compensatory, one-reason decision rule that relies solely on the most valid discriminating cue, while Tallying is an equal-weight compensatory rule that simply counts the number of cues favoring each option. By probabilistically mixing these distinct strategies on a trial-by-trial basis (or reflecting a population-level mixture of strategy users), decision-makers exhibit intermediate compensatory behavior. This avoids the need for a unified, complex non-linear cue weighting mechanism like Weighted Additive (WADD) models. Decision stochasticity is accounted for by the probabilistic strategy selection, strategy-specific softmax response noise, and an overarching lapse rate. The mixture is heavily biased toward TTB, reflecting the empirical dominance of one-reason decision making in these environments.

**Rationale:** Kept the Adaptive Toolbox mechanism exactly as proposed but adjusted the parameter ranges based on critic feedback. The previous uniform range for `p_ttb` [0.0, 1.0] caused the model to predict an average 50/50 split between TTB and Tallying, washing out the empirical dominance of TTB observed in Experiments 1 and 4. I shifted the `p_ttb` range to [0.5, 1.0] to reflect a strong prior preference for TTB, and reduced the upper bound on the lapse rate `epsilon` from 0.5 to 0.2 to prevent excessive uniform noise from flattening the predictions.

**Parameters:**
  - `p_ttb`: `[0.5, 1.0]`
  - `beta_ttb`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `beta_tally`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.2]`
  - `validities`: `validities`
