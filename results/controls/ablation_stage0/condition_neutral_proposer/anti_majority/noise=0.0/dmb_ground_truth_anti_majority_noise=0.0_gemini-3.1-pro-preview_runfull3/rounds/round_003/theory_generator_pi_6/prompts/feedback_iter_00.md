# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Replace THEORY 2 with a 'Linear WADD + Tallying' theory. The new theory should propose that decision-makers evaluate options using a combination of the direct, unscaled linear sum of the cue validities (Linear WADD) and a simple count of the cues (Tallying). By treating validities linearly (gamma = 1), the model will naturally predict the equal choice probabilities seen in Exp 7. Adding a tallying component (weighting the sheer number of positive features) can help capture the strong compensatory shifts seen in Exp 1 and Exp 2. The parameters should include a mixing or weighting factor between the Linear WADD score and the Tallying score, along with standard decision noise.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Decision-makers evaluate options using a combination of the direct, unscaled linear sum of the cue validities (Linear WADD) and a simple count of the cues (Tallying). By treating validities linearly, the model naturally predicts the compensatory choice probabilities seen in experiments where multiple weak cues can outweigh a single strong cue. Adding a tallying component (weighting the sheer number of positive features) helps capture the strong compensatory shifts seen in specific environments. A mixing parameter controls the relative influence of the Linear WADD score versus the Tallying score before decision noise is applied.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Stimulus must be shape (2, n_features).")
    
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    w_tally = float(parameters["w_tally"])
    
    # Linear WADD scores (gamma = 1)
    wadd_a = np.sum(val * a)
    wadd_b = np.sum(val * b)
    
    # Tallying scores (simple count)
    tally_a = np.sum(a)
    tally_b = np.sum(b)
    
    # Combine scores
    score_a = (1.0 - w_tally) * wadd_a + w_tally * tally_a
    score_b = (1.0 - w_tally) * wadd_b + w_tally * tally_b

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- w_tally: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's recommendation, this theory instantiates a 'Linear WADD + Tallying' model. By mixing the unscaled linear sum of cue validities (gamma=1) with a simple cue count (Tallying), we allow the model to capture strong compensatory behavior without needing highly non-linear transformations. The mixing parameter `w_tally` determines the balance between considering the exact validity values versus just the sheer number of cues. This approach avoids the complexities of probabilistic strategy switching while naturally capturing the compensatory shifts seen in Exp 1 and Exp 2.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.7144 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.7144.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate implements the prescribed Linear WADD + Tallying model, but it struggles heavily to match human behavior. In Experiment 1 (TTB-consistency), human observed consistency is 0.65, whereas the candidate yields 0.15, meaning it consistently chooses the compensatory option. Similarly, in Experiment 2 (Tallying-consistency), the candidate over-predicts Tallying choices (0.85 vs observed 0.37). Furthermore, in Experiment 7, the candidate produces a large positive difference (0.41) while the observed data shows a strong negative difference (-0.62). The unscaled validities and raw tallying counts combine in a way that overwhelmingly favors options with more positive cues, completely washing out the impact of the most valid cues.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "To fix the over-reliance on sheer cue quantity while remaining strictly within the prescribed 'Linear WADD + Tallying' family, apply a centering transformation to the validities. Calculate the Linear WADD score using `(validities - 0.5)` instead of raw validities. This ensures that cues are treated as evidence for/against an option relative to chance, which naturally rescales the linear sum and allows the highest-validity cues to better compete against a tally of multiple weak cues. Maintain the mixing parameter `w_tally` and the rest of the mechanism intact."
