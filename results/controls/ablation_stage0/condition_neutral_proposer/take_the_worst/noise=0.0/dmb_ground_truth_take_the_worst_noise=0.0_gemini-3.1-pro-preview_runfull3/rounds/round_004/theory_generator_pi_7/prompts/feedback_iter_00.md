# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_6`).

Propose a brand-new theory that maintains Tallying as the primary decision mechanism (since the data strongly supports it over TTB in conflict trials), but uses Validity-Based Tie-Breaking (Take-The-Best) instead of right-to-left recency. Under this new theory, if the tallies are tied, the decision maker breaks the tie by choosing the option that wins on the feature with the highest objective validity, rather than the most recently read feature. This will allow us to rigorously test whether the tie-breaking behavior observed in the data is driven by reading order (recency) or by feature importance (validity).


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Tallying with Validity-Based Tie-Breaking: Decision makers primarily evaluate options using a Tallying heuristic, counting the number of features where one option strictly dominates the other. When the tallies are tied, they do not guess randomly or rely on recency. Instead, they break ties by inspecting features in descending order of their objective validity (Take-The-Best), favoring the option that wins on the most valid differentiating feature.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Primary strategy: Tallying
    a_wins = np.sum(a > b)
    b_wins = np.sum(b > a)
    
    score_a = float(a_wins)
    score_b = float(b_wins)
    
    # Validity-driven tie-breaking (Take-The-Best)
    if a_wins == b_wins:
        validities = np.array(parameters['validities'], dtype=float)
        sorted_indices = np.argsort(-validities)
        for i in sorted_indices:
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                score_a += 1.0
                break
            elif b[i] > a[i]:
                score_b += 1.0
                break
                
    beta = float(parameters['beta'])
    epsilon = float(parameters['epsilon'])
    
    # Softmax choice with epsilon-greedy lapse
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = len(scores)
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    p = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    p /= p.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(p), p=p))


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.1, 20.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the arbiter's recommendation, this theory maintains Tallying as the dominant mechanism for decision making, as it best explains choice behavior in conflict trials. However, to better capture behavior when Tallying yields a tie, we replace the right-to-left recency tie-breaker with a Validity-Based Tie-Breaker (Take-The-Best). When tallies are equal, the model resolves the tie by examining features in decreasing order of their objective validities, choosing the option that dominates on the most valid differentiating feature.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4489 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4489.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate model successfully implements the arbiter's requested mechanism: Tallying with Validity-Based Tie-Breaking (Take-The-Best) instead of right-to-left recency. By simulating this model, we can directly compare its fit to the human data against the previous recency-based tie-breaking models. The results are highly informative: the validity-based tie-breaker fails drastically on Experiment 8 (simulated 0.3903 vs observed 0.8433) and Experiment 4 (simulated 0.8611 vs observed 0.1433). Experiment 8 explicitly measures right-to-left tie-breaking adherence, and the data strongly shows humans use recency (0.8433) when tallies tie. The validity-based tie-breaker predicts the exact opposite in these designs.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The proposer faithfully implemented the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family (Validity-Based Tie-Breaking). Although the model fails to capture the empirical pattern in Experiments 4 and 8, this failure is highly diagnostic: it conclusively demonstrates that the tie-breaking behavior observed in the human data is driven by reading order (recency) rather than feature importance (validity). Since the proposer executed the requested test perfectly and we have obtained a clear scientific answer, we should accept this candidate so the arbiter can observe the outcome of their hypothesis."
