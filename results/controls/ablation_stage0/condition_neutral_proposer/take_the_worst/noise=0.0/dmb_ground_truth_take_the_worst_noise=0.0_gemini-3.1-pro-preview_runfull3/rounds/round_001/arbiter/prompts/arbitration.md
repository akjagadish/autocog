# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_3" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_3
Weighted Additive Model (WADD): People evaluate options by integrating all available features, weighting each feature by its given validity. Unlike Take The Best, WADD is fully compensatory, meaning multiple lower-validity cues can override a single higher-validity cue. A subjective transformation parameter (gamma) allows the model to scale the validities, seamlessly interpolating between equal-weighting (Tallying, gamma=0) and validity-sensitive compensatory evaluation.

def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Subjective transformation of validities
    gamma = float(parameters["gamma"])
    w = val ** gamma
    
    # Compute weighted sums for both options
    score_a = np.sum(w * a)
    score_b = np.sum(w * b)

    # Softmax choice with numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)

    probabilities = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_3)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.8, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To maximally distinguish WADD from Tallying, we use a 5-feature design with a wide spread of validities. Tallying relies exclusively on the count of winning features, ignoring their validities, whereas WADD integrates all features weighted by their subjective validity. The design includes 'Tallying-tie' trials where both options win on an equal number of features but WADD strongly prefers one option due to higher validities. It also includes 'compensatory' trials where Tallying prefers the option with more winning features, but WADD favors the option with fewer but higher-validity features. This structural dissociation allows us to identify whether subjects are weighting by validity or simply counting feature wins.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates trials where Tallying and WADD diverge sharply. Trials 1, 2, 5, and 8 are 'Tallying-ties' where both options win on an equal number of features, leading Tallying to guess (50% choice probability). However, WADD has a strong preference driven by the validities. Trial 6 is a 'compensatory' trial where Tallying prefers option A (which wins on 3 features), but WADD prefers option B (which wins on 2 but much higher-validity features). By averaging the choice probability in the direction of WADD's preference across these 5 trial types, we expect a value near 0.42 for Tallying and > 0.8 for WADD, providing a large and reliable contrast.

**Rationale:** To maximally distinguish Tallying from the Weighted Additive Model (WADD), we use a 6-feature design with a wide range of validities to create structural dissociations. Tallying relies solely on the count of winning features, completely ignoring their validities, whereas WADD integrates all features weighted by their subjective validity. The design includes 'Tallying-tie' trials where both options win on an equal number of features but WADD strongly prefers one option due to higher validities. It also includes 'compensatory' trials where Tallying prefers the option with more winning features, but WADD favors the option with fewer but higher-validity features. This allows us to cleanly identify whether subjects are weighting by validity or simply counting feature wins.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric isolates trials where Tallying predicts a perfect tie (equal number of feature wins for both options). On these trials, the Tallying heuristic has no basis for preference and must guess, resulting in a 50% choice rate regardless of its beta or epsilon parameters. In contrast, WADD integrates the feature validities, and the experimental design guarantees that WADD has a strict, directionally consistent preference on these tie trials for any gamma > 0. The metric calculates the proportion of choices that align with WADD's preference on these Tallying-tie trials. Tallying will yield ~0.50, while WADD will yield significantly > 0.50.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.
