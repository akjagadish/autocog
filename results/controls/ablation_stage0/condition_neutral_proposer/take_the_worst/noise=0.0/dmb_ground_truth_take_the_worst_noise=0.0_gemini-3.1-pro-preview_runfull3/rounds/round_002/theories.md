# Round 2 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_4` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Take The Best (Lexicographic Heuristic)

**Rationale:** Take The Best (TTB) evaluates options lexicographically by consulting features in decreasing order of validity. The first feature that discriminates between the options determines the choice entirely, and all remaining lower-validity features are ignored. This embodies a fast-and-frugal heuristic that is strictly non-compensatory, contrasting sharply with exhaustive integration models like WADD or Tallying. The model uses a softmax over the binary TTB choice to account for decision noise, coupled with a lapse rate for random guessing.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Expected state to have shape (2, n_features)")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort features by validity in descending order
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(-validities, kind="mergesort")
    
    scores = np.zeros(2)
    discriminated = False
    
    # Lexicographic search: stop at the first discriminating feature
    for f_idx in sorted_indices:
        if a[f_idx] != b[f_idx]:
            if a[f_idx] > b[f_idx]:
                scores[0] = 1.0
            else:
                scores[1] = 1.0
            discriminated = True
            break
            
    if not discriminated:
        return np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax conversion with numerical stability
    logits = beta * scores
    logits -= np.max(logits)
    probs = np.exp(logits) / np.sum(np.exp(logits))
    
    # Mixture with uniform lapse
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * probs + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    p = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    p /= p.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(p), p=p))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_5` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Tallying with Right-to-Left Position-Based Tie-Breaking

**Rationale:** Applying a minimal edit to the tie-breaking logic based on critic feedback. The previous left-to-right search failed on Experiments 3 and 4's tie-trials. Reversing the search direction to right-to-left (perhaps reflecting a recency effect in evaluating sequentially presented features) explains the systematic deviations observed in those experiments while maintaining the core Tallying performance on conflict trials.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Tallying: count strict feature-wise wins
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])
    
    # Position-based lexicographic tie-breaking (right-to-left)
    if a_wins == b_wins:
        for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                scores[0] += 1.0
                break
            elif b[i] > a[i]:
                scores[1] += 1.0
                break
                
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Softmax with numerical stability
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    p = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    p /= p.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities
    return int(np.random.choice(len(p), p=p))
```
