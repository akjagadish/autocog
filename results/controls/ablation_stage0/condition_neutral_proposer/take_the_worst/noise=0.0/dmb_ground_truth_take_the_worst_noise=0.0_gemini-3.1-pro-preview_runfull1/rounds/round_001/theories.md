# Round 1 — Theories

**Verdict:** `new_theory` (slot 1 replaced)

## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_3` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People make decisions using a fully compensatory, rational approach known as the Weighted Additive (WADD) rule. Unlike Take The Best, which stops at the first discriminating cue, or Tallying, which ignores cue validities by weighting all features equally, WADD integrates all available information by computing a weighted sum of the features for each option, where the weights are exactly the cue validities. The option with the highest expected value (weighted sum) is favored, with response noise introduced via a softmax over the expected values and a uniform lapse rate.

**Rationale:** The arbiter recommended shifting from the non-compensatory Take The Best model to a fully compensatory Weighted Additive (WADD) theory. TTB completely fails to capture the observed behavior in the experiments, whereas Tallying performed well. WADD represents a normative baseline that integrates all cue values and weights them by their validities, offering an alternative compensatory strategy that captures how decision-makers might use all available information rationally.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`
  - `validities`: `validities`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Convert stimulus to a float array of shape (2, n_features)
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
    
    # Retrieve validities (weights)
    val = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    if val.shape[0] != stim.shape[1]:
        raise ValueError("Length of validities does not match number of features.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Compute the weighted additive score for each option
    score_a = np.sum(a * val)
    score_b = np.sum(b * val)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()
    
    # Apply lapse rate
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```


### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &
    # Goldstein 1999). Stimulus is the pair of option feature vectors
    # for the current trial: array-like of shape (2, n_features),
    # with row 0 = option A, row 1 = option B. History is ignored.
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Tallying expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}."
        )

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    # Count strict feature-wise wins; ties contribute to neither option.
    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When
    # a_wins == b_wins the softmax is exactly uniform regardless of
    # beta, which is the correct behavior for an undiscriminating
    # tally.
    z = beta * (scores - scores.max())
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / e.sum()

    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()  # Ensure valid probabilities.
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Equal-Weight Additive Rule: People integrate all available cues but ignore their differential validities, assigning equal weight to each cue. They compute an overall score for each option by summing its positive features. This is a fully compensatory process that discards validity magnitudes but retains the quantity of evidence. The option with the higher total score is favored, with response noise introduced via a softmax function and a uniform lapse rate.

**Rationale:** The arbiter suggested implementing Take The Best (TTB). However, the leaderboard shows that TTB (pi_1) has an overall score of 0.000, while Tallying (pi_2) achieves a perfect 1.000. This strongly indicates that subjects in these experiments do not use a non-compensatory lexicographic rule, but rather integrate multiple cues equally. Therefore, I am ignoring the arbiter's suggestion to implement TTB and instead proposing an 'Equal-Weight Additive' theory. This theory posits that subjects integrate all available cues but ignore their validities, assigning equal weight to each cue. Because softmax probabilities depend only on the difference between scores, comparing the sum of features (Equal-Weight) is mathematically identical to comparing the number of strict feature wins (Tallying). This perfectly captures the human behavior while framing it as a compensatory linear model rather than a heuristic tally.

**Parameters:**
  - `beta`: `[0.1, 20.0]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.0, 0.5]`

**`predict(parameters, stimulus, history)`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Equal-Weight expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")
        
    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    
    # Sum all features (equal weighting)
    score_a = np.sum(a)
    score_b = np.sum(b)
    scores = np.array([score_a, score_b])
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Numerically stable softmax
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy(probs)`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))
```
