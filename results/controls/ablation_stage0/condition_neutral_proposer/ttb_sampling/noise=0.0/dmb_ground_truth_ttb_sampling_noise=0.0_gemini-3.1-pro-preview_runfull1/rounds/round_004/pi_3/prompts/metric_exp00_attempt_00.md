# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.63, 0.8, 0.58, 0.73, 0.68]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** To maximally distinguish Take The Best (TTB) from the Weighted Additive (WADD) model, we exploit the fundamental difference in their decision rules: TTB is purely non-compensatory and stops at the first discriminating feature, whereas WADD integrates all features using their log-odds validities as weights. We define a set of validities where the log-odds of the most valid feature is outweighed by the sum of the log-odds of several less valid features. By pitting the single highest-validity feature against a combination of lower-validity features, we create 'pure reversal' trials where TTB deterministically chooses the option favored by the single best cue, while WADD consistently prefers the option supported by the aggregate weight of the smaller cues. The validities are scrambled in their presentation order to ensure heuristics that rely on validity-ordering must actively re-sort them.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Take The Best (TTB) posits that decision-makers consider features sequentially in order of their subjective validities and stop searching as soon as they find a feature that discriminates between the two options. The choice is then based entirely on this single cue, providing a non-compensatory heuristic alternative to compensatory models like WADD.

**Parameters:**
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Sort indices by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities)[::-1]
    
    a_wins = False
    b_wins = False
    
    # Search for the first discriminating cue
    for idx in order:
        if stim[0, idx] > stim[1, idx]:
            a_wins = True
            break
        elif stim[1, idx] > stim[0, idx]:
            b_wins = True
            break
            
    if a_wins:
        p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
    elif b_wins:
        p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    else:
        p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** The Weighted Additive (WADD) model posits a fully compensatory decision strategy. Decision-makers evaluate all available cues for both options, weighting each cue by its subjective importance (operationalized as the log-odds of its validity). These weighted cues are integrated into a single compensatory score for each option. The option with the higher score is more likely to be chosen, with choices being probabilistic according to a softmax function over the scores. This provides a strong compensatory baseline to contrast with non-compensatory heuristics like Take The Best.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.1, 15.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"WADD expects a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    # Convert validities to log-odds to serve as weights
    validities = np.clip(validities, 1e-5, 1.0 - 1e-5)
    weights = np.log(validities / (1.0 - validities))
    
    # Calculate compensatory scores for each option
    scores = stim @ weights
    
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Convert scores to probabilities via softmax with max-subtraction for stability
    z = beta * scores
    z = z - np.max(z)
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Incorporate uniform lapse rate
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities /= probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- metric: Python source defining def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this metric; used when interpreting results.


## Response

```json
{
  "metric_source": "def metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    # The experimental design consists of 'pure reversal' trials where\n    # Take The Best (TTB) deterministically prefers Option A (response == 0),\n    # while Weighted Additive (WADD) consistently prefers Option B (response == 1).\n    # We simply compute the proportion of times Option A was chosen.\n    return float((data['response'] == 0).mean())",
  "rationale": "The experimental trials were carefully designed such that the single most valid discriminating cue always favors Option A, while the sum of the remaining less valid cues always favors Option B. Thus, TTB universally predicts choosing Option A across all 8 trial types, whereas WADD universally predicts choosing Option B. The overall proportion of Option A choices perfectly separates the two models."
