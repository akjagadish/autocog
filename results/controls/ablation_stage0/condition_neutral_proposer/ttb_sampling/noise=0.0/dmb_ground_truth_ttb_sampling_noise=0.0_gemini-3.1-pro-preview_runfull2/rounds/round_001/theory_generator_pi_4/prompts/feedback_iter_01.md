# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace the Weighted Additive model with a new heuristic-based theory, such as a 'Probabilistic Cue Search' or 'Tallying' model. For instance, a 'Tallying with Validity Threshold' theory where subjects only count features whose validity exceeds a certain subjective threshold, or a 'Stochastic Take-The-Best' where the search order is probabilistic rather than strictly deterministic. This provides a more plausible boundedly rational alternative to the strict TTB rule.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Stochastic Take-The-Best (STTB): People use a non-compensatory, one-reason heuristic to compare options, but their search order is probabilistic rather than strictly deterministic. The probability of examining a cue next is determined by a softmax over the subjective validities of the remaining unexamined cues. The search stops at the first feature that discriminates between the two options, and the decision is based solely on that feature. If the selected feature ties, it is ignored and the search continues. If all features are exhausted without a discriminator, the decision maker guesses. This model interpolates between strict Take-The-Best (at high inverse temperature) and the Minimalist heuristic with random cue search (at zero inverse temperature).

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("STTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])

            return np.array([0.5, 0.5])
        
        v = validities[available_cues]
        z = beta * v
        z = z - np.max(z)  # numerical stability
        p = np.exp(z)
        p = p / np.sum(p)

            if a[cue_idx] > b[cue_idx]:
                ans[0] += p[i]
            elif b[cue_idx] > a[cue_idx]:

                ans += p[i] * get_prob(new_cues)
        return ans

    n_features = len(validities)
    p_core = get_prob(list(range(n_features)))

`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.0, 200.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
Following the critic's feedback, the upper bound of the softmax inverse temperature (beta) for cue selection is increased from 20.0 to 200.0. In the previous iteration, a beta of 20.0 was insufficient to produce the highly deterministic search orders required to capture the strong Take-The-Best compliance observed in Experiments 3 and 4, since validities often differ by only small amounts (e.g., 0.1). Expanding the upper bound allows the model to closely approximate strict deterministic TTB when fit to subjects who exhibit that behavior, while preserving the ability to model more stochastic search paths via lower beta values.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3307 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0593 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0593.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The Stochastic Take-The-Best (STTB) model successfully captures the behavior in Experiment 2 and improves the overall loss, but it drastically underestimates the deterministic Take-The-Best (TTB) compliance observed in Experiments 3 and 4 (predicting ~0.48-0.59 where humans are at ~0.84-0.85). This suggests that the model is forced to be too stochastic.
Rationale: The candidate is on the right track within the prescribed family, but the search order is too random. The upper bound on `beta` (20.0) is likely too low to allow for a mostly deterministic search when differences in cue validities are relatively small (e.g., a difference of 0.1 with beta=20 only yields a logit difference of 2.0). Increase the upper bound of `beta` significantly (e.g., to 100.0 or 200.0) so the model can closely approximate strict TTB when the data demands it. Alternatively, transform the validities into log-odds before applying the beta multiplier to better separate the cues.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3307 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0593 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Stochastic Take-The-Best (STTB) model with an increased beta upper bound (up to 200.0) captures the empirical data exceptionally well across all four experiments. The aggregate loss dropped significantly to 0.0593. The model closely matches the Tallying difference variance in Experiment 1, correctly predicts the heuristic choices in Experiment 2, and accurately models the high rate of deterministic Take-The-Best compliance observed in Experiments 3 and 4. The increased beta range successfully allowed the model to act almost deterministically when needed while retaining the capacity for stochastic search paths.",
