# metric_exp00_attempt_01

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=5):** [0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.75]

**Trial pairs (n=10):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
  trial 8: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 10: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** To distinguish Take The Best (TTB) from Stochastic Take-The-Best (STTB), we use a set of closely spaced validities. TTB strictly orders features by validity and will always base its decision on the single most valid discriminating cue, regardless of how many lower-validity cues point the other way. STTB, however, selects the cue to examine probabilistically based on a softmax over validities. By creating trials where the most valid discriminating cue favors Option A, but several slightly less valid cues favor Option B, TTB will deterministically choose Option A, whereas STTB will predict a non-trivial probability of choosing Option B (since it might sample one of the many cues favoring B first). We also include trials with ties on the most valid cues to test the secondary search probabilities.

**Computed schedule:** 10 unique pairs × 9 reps = 90 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Take The Best (TTB): People compare two options by ordering features by their subjective validity and searching through them sequentially. The search stops at the first feature that discriminates between the two options (i.e., one option has a higher value than the other), and the decision is based entirely on that single feature. This non-compensatory strategy ignores all other features, preventing any compensatory trade-offs. If no feature discriminates, the learner guesses. Response noise is modeled via an independent lapse rate epsilon, which replaces the deterministic TTB choice with a uniform random pick.

**Parameters:**
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**
```python
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    import numpy as np
    stim = np.asarray(stimulus, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError("TTB expects a (2, n_features) stimulus.")

    a, b = stim[0], stim[1]
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    
    # Order features by validity in descending order
    order = np.argsort(validities, kind='stable')[::-1]
    
    # Default to guessing if no cue discriminates
    p_core = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    
    # Sequential search for the first discriminating cue
    for idx in order:
        if a[idx] > b[idx]:
            p_core = np.array([1.0, 0.0])
            break
        elif b[idx] > a[idx]:
            p_core = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
            break
            
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    n_opts = p_core.shape[0]
    
    # Blend deterministic choice with uniform lapse
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * (np.ones(n_opts) / n_opts)
```

**`policy source code`:**
```python
def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np
    probabilities = np.asarray(probabilities, dtype=np.float64)
    probabilities = probabilities / probabilities.sum()
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities)
```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Stochastic Take-The-Best (STTB): People use a non-compensatory, one-reason heuristic to compare options, but their search order is probabilistic rather than strictly deterministic. The probability of examining a cue next is determined by a softmax over the subjective validities of the remaining unexamined cues. The search stops at the first feature that discriminates between the two options, and the decision is based solely on that feature. If the selected feature ties, it is ignored and the search continues. If all features are exhausted without a discriminator, the decision maker guesses. This model interpolates between strict Take-The-Best (at high inverse temperature) and the Minimalist heuristic with random cue search (at zero inverse temperature).

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.0, 200.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

        v = validities[available_cues]
        z = beta * v
        z = z - np.max(z)  # numerical stability
        p = np.exp(z)
        p = p / np.sum(p)
        
        ans = np.zeros(2)

            if a[cue_idx] > b[cue_idx]:
                ans[0] += p[i]
            elif b[cue_idx] > a[cue_idx]:
                ans[1] += p[i]
            else:
                new_cues = [c for c in available_cues if c != cue_idx]
                ans += p[i] * get_prob(new_cues)
        return ans

    n_features = len(validities)
    p_core = get_prob(list(range(n_features)))
    
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])

def policy(probabilities):
    import numpy as np

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
[0] rationale: By design, Take The Best (TTB) will deterministically choose Option A on every single trial because the most valid discriminating cue always points to A. Any deviations from choosing A under TTB are solely due to uniform response noise. In contrast, Stochastic Take-The-Best (STTB) probabilistically samples cues based on their validities, and since there are multiple lower-validity cues favoring Option B on many trials, STTB will frequently choose Option B. Therefore, the overall proportion of times Option A is chosen (response == 0) will be near 1.0 for TTB (minus noise) and significantly lower for STTB.

TTB strictly follows this cue, meaning its probability of choosing Option A is constant across all trials (subject only to uniform response noise). STTB, however, samples cues probabilistically. Its probability of choosing Option A depends on the total number of cues favoring each option. By comparing trials where Option A has more positive ratings than Option B (sum(A) > sum(B)) against trials where Option B has more positive ratings (sum(A) < sum(B)), we can cleanly separate the theories. TTB predicts a difference of ~0 between these trial types, whereas STTB predicts a significantly higher rate of choosing A when A has more overall positive features."
