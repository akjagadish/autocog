# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Propose a 'Rank-Based Weighting' theory. Instead of using the raw objective validities or transforming them via a power function (as in NLSW), subjects might rank the features based on their provided validities and assign subjective weights that decay as a function of their ordinal rank (e.g., exponential or inverse rank decay). This theory would remain compensatory and allow for overrides (similar to NLSW) but would predict that the exact numerical differences between validities matter less than their ordered priority. This provides a strong, plausible alternative to NLSW that dispenses with the raw validity values entirely.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Rank-Based Weighting Model: Subjects evaluate options by computing a weighted sum of their features, but instead of using the raw objective validities, they rank the features based on their validities. Subjective weights are assigned using an inverse rank decay function, where the weight of a feature is inversely proportional to its ordinal rank raised to an individual-specific power (alpha). This mechanism unifies multiple decision strategies: an alpha near 0 flattens the weights (yielding Equal-Weight/Tallying), while a large alpha strongly amplifies the top-ranked cues (yielding non-compensatory Take The Best behavior). It predicts that the exact numerical differences between validities matter less than their ordered priority.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.stats import rankdata
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")
        
    validities = np.asarray(parameters["validities"], dtype=float)
    alpha = float(parameters["alpha"])
    beta = float(parameters["beta"])
    epsilon = float(parameters["epsilon"])
    
    # Rank features by validity (highest validity = rank 1)
    # Using method='dense' so tied validities get the same rank
    ranks = rankdata(-validities, method='dense')
    
    # Inverse rank decay: w = 1 / (rank ^ alpha)
    w = 1.0 / (ranks ** alpha)
    
    # Option scores are the weighted sum of features
    scores = stim @ w
    
    # Softmax over scores with inverse temperature beta
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Add independent lapse noise
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- alpha: [0.0, 10.0]
- beta: [0.1, 15.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
This theory implements the arbiter's suggestion of a 'Rank-Based Weighting' model. By transforming validities into ordinal ranks and applying an inverse rank decay function, the model dispenses with raw validity values while retaining a fully compensatory architecture. The alpha parameter controls the steepness of the rank decay, smoothly interpolating between Tallying (alpha=0) and Take The Best (large alpha). This provides a robust alternative to NLSW that captures the intuition that decision-makers prioritize cues by their ordinal standing rather than their exact numerical validities.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.5735 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.5735.

In Experiment 3, the real data shows a strong preference for WADD-like compensatory behavior (metric = 0.2317), whereas the candidate strongly predicts PHS/TTB-like non-compensatory behavior (metric = 0.8337). A similar discrepancy occurs in Experiment 4, where the model significantly underpredicts the target choice rate. This suggests that the current inverse rank decay function (1 / rank^alpha) with alpha up to 10.0 heavily penalizes lower-ranked cues, forcing the model into a hyper-non-compensatory regime that fails to capture human compensatory strategies.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The rank-based weighting concept is sound but the specific decay function and parameter ranges are forcing too much non-compensatory behavior. Please regenerate within the same family but change the weight decay to an exponential rank decay, e.g., `w = lambda_param ** (ranks - 1)`, where `lambda_param` is bounded between [0.0, 1.0]. A `lambda_param` near 1 yields equal weighting (Tallying), while near 0 yields Take The Best. This form might offer a smoother and more robust interpolation for compensatory behavior. Additionally, ensure the temperature parameter `beta` has a reasonable range (e.g., [0.1, 10.0])."
