# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real (human / ground-truth) data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Replace the Rank-Based Weighting Model with a brand-new theory, such as a 'Threshold-Gated Compensatory Model' or a 'Semi-Lexicographic Heuristic'. This new theory should posit that subjects evaluate the numerical gaps between cue validities: if a gap between adjacent cues exceeds a certain subjective threshold, all lower-ranked cues are heavily discounted or outright ignored (acting non-compensatory). If the validities are clustered closely together, subjects integrate them additively. This differs from Theory 2's continuous power-law scaling by introducing discrete strategy shifts or step-function discounting based on validity gaps, which might better capture the high override rates seen in Experiments 7 and 8.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Threshold-Gated Compensatory Model: Subjects sort cues by their validities and evaluate the numerical gaps between adjacent cues in this sorted order. If the validities are closely clustered, subjects integrate them additively, functioning as a weighted additive model. However, if a gap exceeds a subjective threshold, all subsequent lower-ranked cues are heavily discounted or completely ignored, triggering a shift toward a non-compensatory, semi-lexicographic heuristic.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    import numpy as np
    
    stim = np.asarray(state, dtype=float)
    if stim.ndim != 2 or stim.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected a (2, n_features) stimulus; got shape {stim.shape}.")

        w_sorted[0] = sorted_vals[0]
        current_discount = 1.0
        
        for i in range(1, len(sorted_vals)):
            # If the gap between adjacent sorted validities exceeds the threshold, apply discount
            if (sorted_vals[i-1] - sorted_vals[i]) > gap_threshold:
                current_discount *= discount_factor
            w_sorted[i] = sorted_vals[i] * current_discount
            
    # Map subjective weights back to original feature order
    w = np.zeros_like(validities)
    w[order] = w_sorted
    
    # Option scores are the sum of feature values weighted by the threshold-gated subjective weights
    scores = stim @ w
    
    # Softmax over scores with inverse temperature beta
    z = beta * (scores - np.max(scores))
    e = np.exp(z)
    p_core = e / np.sum(e)
    
    # Add independent lapse noise
    return (1.0 - epsilon) * p_core + epsilon * np.array([0.5, 0.5])


`policy(probs) -> int`:
def policy(probs):
    import numpy as np
    probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64)
    probs /= probs.sum()
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs))


`parameters`:
- gap_threshold: [0.0, 0.5]
- discount_factor: [0.0, 1.0]
- beta: [0.1, 15.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.5]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
The Threshold-Gated Compensatory Model directly implements the arbiter's suggestion to evaluate numerical gaps between cue validities. It posits that subjects behave compensatorily (like WADD) when cue validities are close together, but switch to a non-compensatory strategy (like Take-The-Best) when they encounter a large drop-off in cue validity. This step-function discounting captures discrete strategy shifts better than continuous power-law scaling, offering a mechanistic explanation for the high override rates and variance seen in Experiments 7 and 8 where specific cue spacing dictates heuristic use.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.3141 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.3141.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The Threshold-Gated Compensatory Model successfully implemented the arbiter's recommendation and was ACCEPTED by the gate, establishing a new running best. It captures the general direction of most experiments but significantly underestimates the magnitude of effects in Experiments 1, 2, 5, and 6, while overestimating Experiment 7. Notably, the underestimation in Experiment 5 (0.0958 vs real 0.4767) suggests that the shift to non-compensatory behavior isn't triggering frequently enough or strongly enough when facing weak vs strong opposing cues.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The candidate is conceptually well-aligned with the arbiter's prescribed family and improved the loss, but parameter ranges should be tuned to better capture the magnitude of the threshold-gated strategy shifts. Specifically, narrow the `gap_threshold` range to [0.0, 0.3] to ensure the discrete shift triggers more readily for typical validity distributions, and consider widening `beta` to [0.1, 25.0] to allow for sharper determinism when the non-compensatory heuristic is engaged. Maintain the same core gap-evaluating mechanism."
