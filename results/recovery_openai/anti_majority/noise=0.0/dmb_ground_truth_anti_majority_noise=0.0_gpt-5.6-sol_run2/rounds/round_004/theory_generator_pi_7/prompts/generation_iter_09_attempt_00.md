# generation_iter_09_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Replace pi_6 with a new task-invariant theory of semantic-polarity inference and display-invariant compressive evidence accumulation. The new theory should retain a stable subject-level interpretation of whether marks are adverse or beneficial, but represent the tally margin through a flexible sublinear function of the absolute count difference—such as a signed power/logarithmic accumulator followed by mild saturation—whose scale depends on margin magnitude rather than on the fraction or number of discriminating cues. This should yield no systematic sparse-versus-dense effect when count and validity evidence are fixed, as required by Experiment 1, while producing continued but diminishing growth from moderate to large margins: stronger than pi_6's near-immediate saturation yet far weaker than pi_4's linear extrapolation, as required jointly by Experiments 2 and 10. Add a modest, continuously available count-residualized validity channel, with partial reliability standardization and attentional attenuation as display complexity increases, but do not impose pi_6's discrimination-fraction scaling or strong conflict normalization. Allow stable subject heterogeneity in count curvature, validity attention, polarity confidence, and precision so the model can reproduce the elevated variances in several experiments. The critical competitor should therefore predict: condition invariance in Experiment 1; approximately 0.875 fewer-mark choices at large margins in Experiment 2; an intermediate margin contrast near -28 in Experiment 10; and weaker validity slopes in Experiments 8 and 9 without eliminating the validity modulation seen in Experiment 7.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.696)

**Description**
Discrepancy-Evoked Residual Audit with Capacity-Limited Tie Escalation: people first form an adverse-markedness preference from a nonlinear count difference, while count-residualized validity information remains continuously available. Count discrepancies evoke an additional validity audit, but exact count ties trigger a distinct escalation because tallying provides no provisional winner. This tie escalation is strongest when the cue set fits within a fixed attentional capacity and rapidly dilutes as the number of cues exceeds that capacity. Stable subject differences in tie escalation complement existing differences in count reliance, discrepancy auditing, semantic polarity, precision, and lapses.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.645)

**Description**
Semantic-Polarity Smooth Integration theory: people first interpret what the marked binary state means rather than assuming that 1 is intrinsically desirable. Each subject forms a stable posterior belief that a mark is adverse or suspicious. Conditional on either the adverse interpretation or its residual beneficial alternative, the subject smoothly integrates two continuous signals: the difference in total marks and a partially count-residualized validity-weighted difference. The count signal normally dominates, while the weighted signal supplies graded sensitivity to which experts carry the marks on every trial. The two semantic interpretations generate opposite choice distributions, which are averaged according to the subject's polarity confidence. A small lapse process captures stimulus-independent errors.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.419)

**Description**
Capacity-Calibrated Dual-Channel Integration theory: people continuously integrate a rapid representation of the relative number of marked ratings with a validity-sensitive representation of where those marks occur. Neither representation is encoded in raw additive units. The count channel expresses the tally margin relative to the proportion of displayed cues that discriminate and then passes it through a smooth saturating response, so large margins remain decisive without producing indefinitely increasing evidence. A stable discrimination-scaling exponent governs how strongly sparse cue sets dilute count evidence. The validity channel represents count-residualized reliability evidence using softly standardized units and divisively normalizes it according to display size, the number of discriminating cues, and cue conflict. Partial rather than full reliability-energy standardization preserves psychologically meaningful differences between sharply separated and shallow validity profiles without allowing low-dispersion profiles to become artificially amplified. Validity remains available on every trial, including count ties, but there are no special tie, audit, or selected-margin rules. A stable allocation parameter controls the balance between channels. Capacity also contracts the behavioral expression of individual differences in allocation and precision as displays become large, yielding appreciable heterogeneity in compact tasks but more homogeneous behavior in very high-dimensional tasks. Stable semantic-polarity confidence determines whether marked states are interpreted as adverse or beneficial, while stable response precision and lapse rate govern stochasticity.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1753 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2331 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1357 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4: loss=0.1189 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5: loss=0.1760 -> REJECTED
- iter 6: loss=0.1429 -> REJECTED
- iter 7: loss=0.1648 -> REJECTED
- iter 8: loss=0.1313 -> REJECTED
- iter 9: loss=0.1331 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 4 at loss=0.1189 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Polarity-Anchored Dual-Timescale Margin Integration theory: subjects maintain a stable semantic interpretation of whether binary marks are adverse or beneficial. Conditional on that interpretation, tally evidence depends only on the signed absolute count margin, never on display density or the number of discriminating cues. A rapidly compressing accumulator supplies strong evidence at the first nonzero margin, while a very small logarithmic tail preserves continued but sharply diminishing growth across moderate and large margins. Count-residualized validity evidence remains continuously available but is softly standardized and subject to a later, steeper capacity curve that slightly reduces average validity influence at 11 features, preserves relatively more influence at 15 features, and strongly attenuates it by 19 and 37 features. Stable subject differences in count strength, compression, validity attention, semantic polarity, precision, and lapses produce persistent behavioral heterogeneity.

`rationale`: This is a parameter-localized refinement of the accepted architecture. The logarithmic-tail range is reduced and narrowed while remaining strictly positive. Thus the saturated fast component continues to support the already accurate large-margin choice rate in Experiment 10, but there is less incremental count evidence between margins 1 and 5, targeting Experiment 8's residual +44 contrast and limiting its excessive variance. The validity-capacity knee is moved later and made steeper while mean validity attention is reduced. Relative to the previous curve, this can slightly reduce average validity influence at 11 cues while retaining more at 15 cues, allowing residual validity to compete with the first count increment in Experiment 7 without restoring the Experiment 9 density association at 19 cues or validity effects at 37 cues. Reliability standardization is moved close to zero so smooth, low-energy profiles are no longer disproportionately strengthened, targeting the excessive Experiment 6 slope relative to Experiment 5. Finally, the validity-attention range is widened around its revised mean to increase subject heterogeneity in Experiments 1 and 3–6, while the narrowed tail avoids adding further heterogeneity to Experiment 8.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed mechanism family and improves the large-margin prediction: Experiment 10 is close to the target (0.9016 versus 0.8750), and Experiments 2 and 3 also show the correct qualitative behavior. However, it fails the central margin-contrast constraint spectacularly. In Experiment 8, the predicted contrast is +268 rather than the observed -28, indicating far too much growth in fewer-mark choice between margins 1 and 5. This is not an intermediate extrapolation between immediate saturation and linear accumulation. Experiment 9 also shows a substantial unintended density association (-1.3435 versus -0.0407), despite the intended display invariance. Smaller but systematic errors occur in Experiments 1 and 4, where adverse tally alignment is too weak, and in Experiments 5–7, where the validity channel is underpowered in Experiment 5 but overpowered in Experiments 6 and 7. Between-subject variance is also markedly underestimated in Experiments 1, 3–6, and 10.
Rationale: Retain the polarity-anchored, absolute-margin, count-residualized-validity architecture, but recalibrate it. The count transform currently allocates too little evidence to small margins and far too much incremental evidence from margin 1 to 5. Use lower count curvature and a compensating gain/offset adjustment that raises margin-1 evidence while holding or slightly reducing evidence at margins 5 and above. This should move Experiment 8 sharply downward, strengthen the underpredicted tally effects in Experiments 1 and 4, and slightly reduce the overprediction in Experiments 3 and 10 without reverting to pi_6-style immediate saturation. Separately, suppress validity-induced density effects on larger displays: strengthen display-load attenuation above roughly 11 features while compensating with modestly higher baseline validity attention so Experiment 5 is not weakened further. Reducing the reliability-standardization exponent may also help distinguish Experiments 5 and 6, because the present normalization appears to amplify the smoother validity profile in Experiment 6 disproportionately. These changes should reduce the excessive Experiment 7 modulation and bring Experiment 9 toward zero. Finally, widen subject heterogeneity primarily in count curvature/gain and precision rather than adding trial-specific normalization; current variances are much too contracted in most small and medium displays. The current iteration was accepted by the gate, so it is a useful base, but the sign-and-magnitude failure in Experiment 8 is too large to ship.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1753 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2331 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is faithful to the prescribed polarity-anchored, absolute-margin family, but it is decisively worse than the accepted iteration and was rejected by the gate (loss 0.2331 versus 0.1753). The previous coordinated push toward very low curvature, tiny offsets, stronger overload attenuation, and greater validity attention did not work and should not be repeated. Most importantly, Experiment 8 moved farther from the required intermediate margin contrast: +326 versus the observed -28, compared with +268 in the accepted base. At the same time, large-margin behavior became too weak in Experiments 3 (0.5967 versus 0.7367) and 10 (0.8194 versus 0.8750). Thus the revised power law reduced overall large-margin evidence without solving the excessive margin-1-to-margin-5 contrast. Tally effects also weakened in Experiments 1 and 4. The validity recalibration produced mixed and unstable results: Experiment 5 improved, but Experiment 6 worsened, Experiment 7 remains much too positive, and Experiment 9 crossed from a negative error to an even larger positive error (2.6317 versus -0.0407). Because feature count is constant within Experiment 9, a display-level overload multiplier cannot by itself remove that trial-level density association; the relevant problem is the balance between the count signal and validity residual across those stimuli. Between-subject variance remains too low in Experiments 1 and 3–6, although the current broad widening overshoots variance in Experiment 8 and therefore is not an adequate general solution.
Rationale: Build the next candidate on the unchanged accepted iteration-1 base, but do not repeat the rejected package of lower curvature, tiny offsets, and an exponential overload term. Instead, make a localized in-family change to the compressive accumulator's shape. A two-timescale sublinear function—such as a dominant rapidly compressing component plus a smaller logarithmic tail—can give strong evidence at margin 1, little additional growth from 1 to 5, and continued mild growth from 5 through 13. This directly addresses Experiment 8 while preserving the accepted base's good Experiments 3 and 10 performance and strengthening the small-margin effects needed in Experiments 1 and 4. Calibrate the three anchor points explicitly rather than changing curvature and gain jointly: margin 1 should be stronger than in the accepted base, margin 5 should be approximately unchanged or slightly reduced, and margins 7–13 should retain enough slow-tail growth to keep Experiment 10 near 0.875.

For the validity channel, replace the problematic combination of power normalization and thresholded exponential overload with a smoother shrinkage normalization and a continuously decreasing capacity curve. A normalization such as division by sqrt(lambda + profile_energy^2) raised to a modest exponent can avoid disproportionately amplifying low-energy profiles, helping reduce Experiment 6 while preserving Experiment 5. Calibrate complexity attenuation separately at the observed display sizes: substantial validity access at 11 features, weaker access at 15, and near-negligible residual influence by 19 and 37 features. This should retain the small modulation required in Experiment 7 while moving Experiment 9 toward zero. Because Experiment 9 has a constant count margin, directly verify that the residual-validity contribution there is nearly flat across its discrimination-density sequence; changing only an n_features multiplier is insufficient unless the resulting residual channel is genuinely small. Finally, use mean-preserving subject heterogeneity rather than another blanket widening of all ranges—for example, dispersion in polarity confidence and count-channel gain around fixed means—so the low variances in Experiments 1 and 3–6 can increase without recreating Experiment 8's excessive variance.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2331 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1357 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted iteration is a meaningful improvement and remains faithful to the prescribed mechanism family. It now fits Experiment 1 reasonably well (-0.3825 versus -0.4355), eliminates the unwanted density association in Experiment 9 (0.0939 versus -0.0407), and nearly exactly captures large-margin choice in Experiment 10 (0.8694 versus 0.8750). Experiment 3 is also close, and Experiment 2 is matched. The two-timescale accumulator and smooth capacity attenuation were therefore productive changes. Nevertheless, two important failures remain. Experiment 7 is severely overpredicted: the margin-one validity-alignment contrast is 0.4263 rather than 0.0392. The fast accumulator is allowing the first count increment to overwhelm or sharply reverse the validity-based tie behavior. Experiment 8 has improved dramatically from +268 to +44, but it still misses the observed -28 and therefore retains too much margin-1-to-margin-5 growth. There are secondary errors: adverse count alignment is too strong in Experiment 4 (-0.6538 versus -0.4825), and the validity channel has the wrong relative calibration across the two 11-feature experiments—slightly too weak in Experiment 5 (0.1949 versus 0.2306) but substantially too strong in Experiment 6 (0.1999 versus 0.1062). Between-subject variance remains too low in Experiments 1, 3–6, and 10, while it is already too high for the Experiment 8 contrast, so blanket range widening would be inappropriate.
Rationale: Build on this accepted candidate and retain the polarity-anchored absolute-margin architecture. The prior recommendation to introduce a fast component plus logarithmic tail was accepted and should be refined rather than replaced. First, reduce and narrow the logarithmic-tail gain. The current large-margin choice level is already correct because the fast component is saturated, whereas the remaining positive Experiment 8 contrast indicates excessive incremental evidence from margin 1 to margin 5. A smaller but still positive tail should move that contrast toward zero or modestly negative while preserving continued diminishing growth and leaving Experiment 10 close to 0.875. Avoid a broad reduction in count gain, which would sacrifice the successful large-margin fit. The excessive Experiment 7 contrast and Experiment 4 alignment require reducing the abrupt behavioral impact of the first count increment specifically when it competes with residual validity evidence. Rebalance the smooth capacity curve rather than adding density scaling: use lower baseline validity gain at 11 cues but a later/flatter capacity knee so relative validity access at 15 cues is not reduced as strongly. More validity competition at 15 cues should prevent the margin-one count signal from producing the enormous Experiment 7 reversal, while attenuation can remain strong by 19 and 37 cues to preserve Experiment 9. For the Experiment 5/6 dissociation, move reliability standardization still closer to zero or make shrinkage more dominant, then retune overall attention modestly; the current normalization disproportionately strengthens the smoother, lower-energy Experiment 6 profile. Finally, narrow heterogeneity in the tail parameter to reduce Experiment 8 variance, while modestly increasing mean-preserving heterogeneity in stable polarity confidence or validity attention to raise the broadly underestimated subject variances. This should be a localized recalibration of the accepted model, not another change of mechanism family.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1357 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.1189 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iteration 4 is accepted and improves the aggregate loss from 0.1357 to 0.1189, so the previous localized refinement was productive. The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed polarity-anchored, display-invariant margin family. It now captures Experiment 8 very well (-36 versus -28), exactly matches Experiment 3, preserves the null classification in Experiment 2, and keeps Experiment 9 near zero. However, it is not yet experiment-invariant enough to ship. The dominant failure is Experiment 7: the predicted margin-one validity-alignment contrast is 0.4063 rather than 0.0392. The later capacity knee barely improved this error from 0.4263, showing that further validity-attention rebalancing alone is unlikely to solve it. Experiment 4 also remains too strongly driven by the adverse count majority (-0.6238 versus -0.4825), while large-margin choice in Experiment 10 has fallen below target (0.8406 versus 0.8750). Together, these results indicate that the fast count component is still too close to immediate saturation: margin 1 has excessive impact, whereas margins 5 and above now need slightly more evidence. Experiment 1 is moderately underpredicted (-0.3558 versus -0.4355). The validity channel also retains the wrong relative calibration across Experiments 5 and 6—too weak in Experiment 5 and too strong in Experiment 6—and most small-display between-subject variances remain underestimated, although Experiment 8 variance is already excessive.
Rationale: Retain the accepted architecture and the now-successful small logarithmic tail; do not reverse the tail reduction that brought Experiment 8 close to target. Instead, recalibrate the fast component at explicit margin anchors. Increase `fast_margin_scale` enough to reduce evidence at margin 1, while modestly increasing `count_gain` so evidence at margins 3–13 is preserved or slightly strengthened. This is a different and more targeted adjustment than further changing the capacity curve: it should sharply reduce Experiment 7's margin-one jump and soften Experiment 4, while restoring Experiment 10 toward 0.875 and potentially strengthening the larger conflict margins in Experiment 1. Keep the change moderate because Experiment 8 is already close: the desired shift is from -36 toward -28, not back to the previously rejected large positive contrasts, and Experiment 3 should remain near its exact fit. Preserve the present strong attenuation at 19 and 37 features because Experiment 9 is already satisfactory. Avoid another broad change in validity attention, since the accepted later-knee adjustment barely affected Experiment 7 and further movement risks damaging Experiments 5, 8, and 9. If tuning the Experiment 5/6 dissociation, make only a small shrinkage/normalization adjustment within the residual-validity channel and evaluate the two profiles jointly. Finally, do not widen all heterogeneity ranges: variance is low in Experiments 1 and 3–6 but already high in Experiments 7–8, so any added dispersion should be confined to stable polarity or profile-specific validity attention rather than count-tail curvature.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.1189 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.1760 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains faithful to the prescribed polarity-anchored, absolute-margin mechanism, but it was rejected by the accept gate: loss rose from the accepted iteration-4 value of 0.1189 to 0.1760. The latest increase in fast-margin scale with compensating count gain should therefore not be repeated. It improved Experiment 1 substantially (-0.4407 versus -0.4355) and restored Experiment 10 (0.8856 versus 0.8750), but it destroyed the previously successful margin contrast in Experiment 8, moving from -36 to +202 against the observed -28. It also worsened Experiment 9 from 0.1417 to 0.8792 and Experiment 6 from 0.1747 to 0.2187. Experiment 7 remains grossly overpredicted at 0.3296 versus 0.0392 despite its modest improvement, while Experiment 4 remains too count-dominated (-0.6192 versus -0.4825). Thus lowering the isolated margin-one count signal while compensating at larger margins creates too much margin-one-to-five growth and is incompatible with the successful Experiment 8 fit. Subject variances also remain too small in Experiments 1 and 3-6 and 10.
Rationale: Build again from the unchanged accepted iteration-4 base, not from this rejected parameter move. Preserve iteration 4's count-gain and fast-scale ranges, because their near-immediate compression was what produced the accurate Experiment 8 contrast. The previous recommendation to increase fast scale and count gain was rejected by the gate and should not be retried, even in a similarly large step. Instead, address Experiment 7 through a different in-family integration knob: add mild saturation to the combined count-plus-validity evidence before response precision, or an equivalent smooth bounded integration nonlinearity. This can reduce the incremental effect of a margin-one count signal when substantial validity evidence is already present, as in Experiment 7, without changing the raw count accumulator or introducing discrimination-fraction scaling. Refit the saturation threshold jointly with response precision so that large count-only margins remain near the Experiment 10 target and the margin-one versus margin-five contrast in Experiment 8 stays near -28. Keep this saturation mild and display invariant; avoid strong conflict normalization or a feature-density gate. Preserve the accepted strong validity attenuation at 19 and 37 cues, since iteration 4 already made Experiment 9 approximately null. Do not broadly retune validity attention again: prior capacity changes barely affected Experiment 7, and the current attempt produced collateral errors in Experiments 6 and 9. If the Experiment 5/6 mismatch is adjusted, use only a small profile-energy shrinkage change and require improvement in both experiments rather than optimizing either alone. Finally, any variance adjustment should be mean-preserving and confined to stable polarity confidence or validity attention; widening count-shape parameters would jeopardize the already delicate Experiment 8 contrast.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.1760 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.1429 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 6
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed polarity-anchored, absolute-margin family, and several core predictions remain good: Experiment 2 is correct, Experiment 1 is close (-0.4090 versus -0.4355), Experiment 3 is close (0.7483 versus 0.7367), Experiment 8 remains near target (-38 versus -28), and Experiment 10 is reasonable (0.8559 versus 0.8750). Nevertheless, the candidate was rejected by the gate: aggregate loss increased from the accepted iteration-4 value of 0.1189 to 0.1429. The newly added post-integration saturation did not solve its intended target—Experiment 7 is essentially unchanged at 0.4042 versus 0.4063 previously, still far above the observed 0.0392—and caused collateral deterioration. Experiment 4 became much too count-dominated (-0.7092 versus -0.4825), Experiment 6's validity slope rose farther above target (0.2224 versus 0.1062), and Experiment 9 moved away from its near-null target (-0.4694 versus -0.0407). Experiment 5 remains underpredicted (0.1673 versus 0.2306). Thus generic saturation of the combined evidence is not selectively compressing the margin-one effect in Experiment 7; after compensatory precision is applied, it mainly distorts other count–validity balances. Between-subject variances also remain too low in most small-display experiments.
Rationale: Build from the unchanged accepted iteration-4 base and do not retain or strengthen the rejected post-integration tanh saturation. The latest advice to use generic combined-evidence saturation was rejected by the gate and produced virtually no Experiment 7 benefit, so repeating it would be unproductive. Also preserve iteration 4's count gain, fast scale, and logarithmic tail: that geometry is responsible for the successful Experiment 8 contrast, and the earlier attempt to alter fast scale and compensate with gain was likewise rejected.

Use a different in-family knob in the count-residualized validity channel: revise how centered validities are represented before accumulation. A mild contrast-sensitive transformation such as signed-power centered weights, `sign(v-mean)*abs(v-mean)^q` with q only modestly above 1 and partial RMS/shrinkage normalization, can emphasize clearly high-versus-low reliability groups while suppressing shallow graded differences. Calibrate this jointly across Experiments 5 and 6: it should increase sensitivity to the clustered validity structure in Experiment 5 while reducing the excessive slope generated by the smoother validity gradient in Experiment 6. The same transformation can strengthen the validity-defined baseline in Experiment 7 and thereby reduce the incremental margin-one contrast through ordinary bounded choice probabilities, without changing the raw count transform or introducing density scaling or strong conflict normalization. It may also provide more counterweight to the excessive count alignment in Experiment 4. Keep the accepted capacity curve and strong attenuation at 19 and 37 features so Experiment 9 remains near zero, and avoid compensating changes to global response precision until this profile transformation is evaluated. Any heterogeneity adjustment should remain mean-preserving and limited to polarity confidence or validity attention; do not widen count-shape parameters, since Experiment 8 variance and mean are already delicate.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.1429 -> iter 7 candidate loss=0.1648 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 7
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains broadly faithful to the prescribed polarity-anchored, absolute-margin mechanism, but it was rejected by the accept gate: loss increased from the iteration-4 best of 0.1189 to 0.1648. The signed-power validity transformation therefore did not provide the intended selective correction. Relative to iteration 4, Experiment 5 improved modestly (0.1921 versus 0.1726; target 0.2306), but Experiment 6 worsened (0.2003 versus 0.1747; target 0.1062), and the principal Experiment 7 failure was unchanged or slightly worse (0.4137 versus 0.4063; target 0.0392). More seriously, previously successful constraints regressed: Experiment 8 moved from -36 to +80 against the target of -28, and Experiment 9 moved from 0.1417 to 0.9470 against the near-zero target. Experiment 4 also remains much too count-dominated (-0.6950 versus -0.4825). Large-margin behavior remains acceptable in Experiments 3 and 10, and Experiment 2 is correct, but these successes were already present in the accepted base. The model also continues to underestimate between-subject variance in most small-display experiments.
Rationale: Return to the unchanged iteration-4 base. The latest recommendation to contrast-enhance centered validities was rejected and produced collateral failures in Experiments 8 and 9 without improving Experiment 7, so do not retain the signed-power transform or retry it with a stronger exponent. Likewise, preserve iteration 4's raw count transform, logarithmic tail, and capacity curve: previous changes to fast-margin scale, generic combined-evidence saturation, and now validity-shape transformation have all been rejected, whereas iteration 4 already fit the crucial Experiment 8 margin contrast and kept Experiment 9 near zero.

Try a different in-family parameterization of stable subject heterogeneity rather than another stimulus-level transform. At present, count gain, validity attention, and precision are effectively varied independently. Introduce a modest stable negative covariance between count strength and validity attention—for example, a single mean-zero subject allocation factor that raises count gain while lowering validity attention, and vice versa—while preserving their iteration-4 marginal means and ranges. This remains a polarity-anchored dual-channel accumulator, but represents a stable count-versus-validity attentional tradeoff. It may reduce the pooled Experiment 7 jump through nonlinear averaging: validity-attentive subjects retain the tie baseline but have weaker margin-one count impact, while count-attentive subjects contribute less validity-defined alignment. It can also increase the currently deficient subject variance without widening count curvature or tail ranges, which would endanger Experiment 8. Keep the covariance modest and explicitly require that Experiment 8 remain near -28 and Experiment 9 remain near zero; reject any coupling that changes those anchors substantially.

Do not attempt to solve the secondary Experiment 5/6 discrepancy with another nonlinear validity-profile transformation in the next iteration. First test whether correlated, mean-preserving heterogeneity improves Experiment 7 and Experiment 4 while retaining iteration 4's successful means. If a small mean adjustment is necessary, alter only the center of validity attention or response precision after establishing the covariance, not the count geometry or display-load function.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 7 candidate loss=0.1648 -> iter 8 candidate loss=0.1313 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 8
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is faithful in broad architecture, and it preserves several important successes: Experiment 2 is exact, Experiments 3 and 10 are very close, Experiment 1 is reasonably close, and the Experiment 8 margin contrast is excellent (-22 versus -28). However, it was rejected by the gate because its loss (0.1313) remains worse than the accepted iteration-4 base (0.1189). The new negative covariance between count gain and validity attention did not solve the intended failures. Relative to iteration 4, Experiment 7 improves only trivially, from 0.4063 to 0.3875, and remains almost ten times the observed 0.0392. Experiment 4 becomes more count-dominated (-0.6538 versus -0.4825), Experiment 6 worsens sharply (0.2185 versus 0.1062), and Experiment 9 moves farther from its near-zero target (0.2824 versus -0.0407). Thus the allocation factor adds variance but changes the wrong mean relationships. More generally, the candidate's description of a dominant component that saturates at the first nonzero margin and an almost negligible logarithmic tail remains close to the near-immediate saturation that the arbiter asked the replacement theory to move beyond, although its current numerical anchors happen to fit Experiments 8 and 10 well.
Rationale: Build from the unchanged accepted iteration-4 base and do not retain or strengthen the rejected count–validity allocation covariance. That intervention barely reduced Experiment 7 while worsening Experiments 4, 6, and 9. Also preserve iteration 4's count-gain, fast-scale, and logarithmic-tail settings for the next test: previous direct changes to count geometry, generic combined-evidence saturation, and validity-weight transformations were all rejected, whereas the accepted geometry fits Experiments 3, 8, and much of 10.

Try a different, narrowly targeted normalization adjustment within the prescribed residual-validity channel. The current reliability-standardization exponent is constrained to be nonnegative and nearly zero. Because the profile-energy scale is generally below or near one, positive exponents can relatively amplify lower-energy, smooth validity profiles—the likely reason Experiment 6 remains much stronger than Experiment 5. Permit a modest negative exponent, so validity residuals are multiplied by a fractional power of the shrinkage-adjusted profile energy rather than divided by it. Compensate with a small increase in the center of global validity attention. This can preserve or raise Experiment 5 while selectively attenuating the smoother Experiment 6 profile. It may also reduce Experiment 7 because its validity residual at tally ties is behaviorally opposed to the metric's high-validity-mark alignment; weakening that tie-specific anti-alignment raises the tie baseline and therefore reduces the excessive margin-one-minus-tie contrast without altering the raw margin accumulator. Keep the adjustment mild and calibrate it jointly against Experiments 5, 6, 7, and 9; strong attenuation or another signed-power cue transform should be avoided.

Do not add further heterogeneity in this iteration. The covariance manipulation increased variance in Experiments 7 and 8 beyond their observed levels while leaving several small-display variances too low, showing that another broad dispersion increase is unlikely to improve aggregate fit. First establish whether the reversed profile-energy normalization improves the mean pattern while retaining Experiment 8 near -28, Experiment 9 near zero, and Experiment 10 near 0.875.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 8 candidate loss=0.1313 -> iter 9 candidate loss=0.1331 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 9 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains within the prescribed polarity-anchored, absolute-margin family, but it was rejected by the accept gate: loss 0.1331 is worse than the iteration-4 running best of 0.1189. The reversed profile-energy exponent recommended previously therefore should not be retained. It modestly improves Experiment 6 relative to iteration 4 (0.1655 versus 0.1747, target 0.1062), but leaves the central Experiment 7 failure essentially unchanged (0.4079 versus 0.0392), weakens Experiment 5 (0.1768 versus 0.2306), and causes regressions in Experiment 8 (+52 versus -28), Experiment 4 (-0.7046 versus -0.4825), and Experiment 9 (0.2527 versus -0.0407). The candidate still performs well on the binary classification in Experiment 2 and remains reasonably close on Experiments 3 and 10, but those successes do not compensate for the non-invariant validity effects. In particular, one global profile-energy exponent cannot distinguish the modest validity slope required in Experiment 5 from the excessive effects in Experiments 6 and 7. Between-subject variance also remains too low in most small-display experiments. Finally, the dominant tanh component is numerically almost saturated at the first nonzero margin, so the implementation remains closer to near-immediate saturation than the arbiter's intended flexible sublinear accumulator, even though iteration 4's anchors happen to fit Experiments 8 and 10 well.
Rationale: Build from the unchanged iteration-4 base. Do not repeat the rejected negative reliability-standardization range, and do not again alter fast-margin scale, add combined-evidence saturation, introduce signed-power cue weights, or impose count–validity covariance; all of those directions were rejected by the gate.

Try a localized compression of the validity residual itself rather than another profile-level exponent. For example, replace the linear residual mapping with a mild odd saturating transform such as `s_v * tanh(raw_validity_residual / s_v)` after partial shrinkage standardization but before display-load attention. Keep the scale large enough that the smaller residuals driving Experiment 5 remain approximately linear, while the unusually large complementary-profile residuals in Experiments 6 and 7 are selectively compressed. This stays within the prescribed continuously available, count-residualized validity channel and avoids discrimination-fraction scaling or conflict normalization. Calibrate the residual scale jointly: Experiment 5 should rise toward 0.23, Experiment 6 should fall toward 0.11, and Experiment 7 must decrease materially from 0.41 while retaining a small positive modulation near 0.04. Preserve iteration 4's capacity curve so attenuation at 19 and 37 features continues to protect Experiment 9.

For this test, leave the accepted count geometry and heterogeneity ranges unchanged. Experiment 8's accepted-base value of -36 and Experiment 3's exact fit are fragile, and the current candidate's +52 demonstrates that ostensibly small global validity rescalings can disturb their count–validity balance. Require the new residual compression to retain Experiment 8 near -28, Experiment 9 near zero, and Experiment 10 near 0.875. If a mild validity-only compression cannot substantially reduce Experiment 7 without damaging those anchors, it should be discarded rather than compensated by another broad precision or count-gain change.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 9 candidate loss=0.1331 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "rationale": "This is a localized edit to the accepted iteration-4 model. The successful count geometry, polarity mixture, shrinkage normalization, and display-capacity curve are unchanged. The only new mechanism is an odd saturating transform of the standardized validity residual. Its scale keeps the smaller residuals important in Experiment 5 approximately linear while selectively compressing the larger complementary-profile residuals implicated in the excessive Experiment 6 and Experiment 7 effects. A small upward shift in validity attention compensates for compression of ordinary residuals and targets Experiment 5 without restoring strong validity influence at 19 or 37 features, where the accepted steep load curve remains protective. No discrimination-fraction scaling, conflict normalization, count-shape change, combined-evidence saturation, signed-power cue transform, or channel covariance is introduced, avoiding the directions previously rejected by the accept gate."
