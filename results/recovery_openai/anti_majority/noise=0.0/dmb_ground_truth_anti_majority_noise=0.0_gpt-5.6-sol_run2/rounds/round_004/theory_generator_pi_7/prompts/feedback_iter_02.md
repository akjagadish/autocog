# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Replace pi_6 with a new task-invariant theory of semantic-polarity inference and display-invariant compressive evidence accumulation. The new theory should retain a stable subject-level interpretation of whether marks are adverse or beneficial, but represent the tally margin through a flexible sublinear function of the absolute count difference—such as a signed power/logarithmic accumulator followed by mild saturation—whose scale depends on margin magnitude rather than on the fraction or number of discriminating cues. This should yield no systematic sparse-versus-dense effect when count and validity evidence are fixed, as required by Experiment 1, while producing continued but diminishing growth from moderate to large margins: stronger than pi_6's near-immediate saturation yet far weaker than pi_4's linear extrapolation, as required jointly by Experiments 2 and 10. Add a modest, continuously available count-residualized validity channel, with partial reliability standardization and attentional attenuation as display complexity increases, but do not impose pi_6's discrimination-fraction scaling or strong conflict normalization. Allow stable subject heterogeneity in count curvature, validity attention, polarity confidence, and precision so the model can reproduce the elevated variances in several experiments. The critical competitor should therefore predict: condition invariance in Experiment 1; approximately 0.875 fewer-mark choices at large margins in Experiment 2; an intermediate margin contrast near -28 in Experiment 10; and weaker validity slopes in Experiments 8 and 9 without eliminating the validity modulation seen in Experiment 7.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Polarity-Anchored Dual-Timescale Margin Integration theory: subjects maintain a stable semantic interpretation of whether binary marks are adverse or beneficial. Conditional on that interpretation, tally evidence depends only on the signed absolute count margin, never on display density or the number of discriminating cues. A rapidly compressing accumulator supplies strong evidence at the first nonzero margin, while a much smaller logarithmic tail preserves diminishing growth across moderate and large margins. Count-residualized validity evidence remains continuously available but is softly standardized and subject to a steep, smooth capacity curve that preserves validity access in compact displays while making it weak in large displays. Stable subject differences in count strength, compression, validity attention, semantic polarity, precision, and lapses produce persistent behavioral heterogeneity.

`rationale`:
This is a localized edit of the accepted architecture. The offset power law is replaced by the critic-recommended two-timescale accumulator. Its fast component gives margin 1 almost all of the dominant count evidence, sharply reducing the excessive margin-1-to-margin-5 growth responsible for Experiment 8's +268 contrast. The small logarithmic tail still distinguishes margins 5 through 13, while the count-gain range preserves strong large-margin choices in Experiments 3 and 10. Because this transform uses only absolute margin, it introduces no sparse-versus-dense count scaling. The validity channel remains count-residualized and continuously active, but profile normalization now uses smooth shrinkage rather than a potentially amplifying raw power denominator. The revised continuous capacity curve leaves appreciable validity access at 11 cues, declines around 15 cues, and becomes small at 19 and 37 cues, targeting the Experiment 5–7 ordering and suppressing the unwanted Experiment 9 density association. Finally, response precision is widened around essentially the same midpoint as before, increasing subject heterogeneity without substantially shifting mean predictions.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1753 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2331 -> REJECTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1357 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.1357.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed mechanism family and improves the large-margin prediction: Experiment 10 is close to the target (0.9016 versus 0.8750), and Experiments 2 and 3 also show the correct qualitative behavior. However, it fails the central margin-contrast constraint spectacularly. In Experiment 8, the predicted contrast is +268 rather than the observed -28, indicating far too much growth in fewer-mark choice between margins 1 and 5. This is not an intermediate extrapolation between immediate saturation and linear accumulation. Experiment 9 also shows a substantial unintended density association (-1.3435 versus -0.0407), despite the intended display invariance. Smaller but systematic errors occur in Experiments 1 and 4, where adverse tally alignment is too weak, and in Experiments 5–7, where the validity channel is underpowered in Experiment 5 but overpowered in Experiments 6 and 7. Between-subject variance is also markedly underestimated in Experiments 1, 3–6, and 10.
Rationale: Retain the polarity-anchored, absolute-margin, count-residualized-validity architecture, but recalibrate it. The count transform currently allocates too little evidence to small margins and far too much incremental evidence from margin 1 to 5. Use lower count curvature and a compensating gain/offset adjustment that raises margin-1 evidence while holding or slightly reducing evidence at margins 5 and above. This should move Experiment 8 sharply downward, strengthen the underpredicted tally effects in Experiments 1 and 4, and slightly reduce the overprediction in Experiments 3 and 10 without reverting to pi_6-style immediate saturation. Separately, suppress validity-induced density effects on larger displays: strengthen display-load attenuation above roughly 11 features while compensating with modestly higher baseline validity attention so Experiment 5 is not weakened further. Reducing the reliability-standardization exponent may also help distinguish Experiments 5 and 6, because the present normalization appears to amplify the smoother validity profile in Experiment 6 disproportionately. These changes should reduce the excessive Experiment 7 modulation and bring Experiment 9 toward zero. Finally, widen subject heterogeneity primarily in count curvature/gain and precision rather than adding trial-specific normalization; current variances are much too contracted in most small and medium displays. The current iteration was accepted by the gate, so it is a useful base, but the sign-and-magnitude failure in Experiment 8 is too large to ship.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1753 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2331 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is faithful to the prescribed polarity-anchored, absolute-margin family, but it is decisively worse than the accepted iteration and was rejected by the gate (loss 0.2331 versus 0.1753). The previous coordinated push toward very low curvature, tiny offsets, stronger overload attenuation, and greater validity attention did not work and should not be repeated. Most importantly, Experiment 8 moved farther from the required intermediate margin contrast: +326 versus the observed -28, compared with +268 in the accepted base. At the same time, large-margin behavior became too weak in Experiments 3 (0.5967 versus 0.7367) and 10 (0.8194 versus 0.8750). Thus the revised power law reduced overall large-margin evidence without solving the excessive margin-1-to-margin-5 contrast. Tally effects also weakened in Experiments 1 and 4. The validity recalibration produced mixed and unstable results: Experiment 5 improved, but Experiment 6 worsened, Experiment 7 remains much too positive, and Experiment 9 crossed from a negative error to an even larger positive error (2.6317 versus -0.0407). Because feature count is constant within Experiment 9, a display-level overload multiplier cannot by itself remove that trial-level density association; the relevant problem is the balance between the count signal and validity residual across those stimuli. Between-subject variance remains too low in Experiments 1 and 3–6, although the current broad widening overshoots variance in Experiment 8 and therefore is not an adequate general solution.
Rationale: Build the next candidate on the unchanged accepted iteration-1 base, but do not repeat the rejected package of lower curvature, tiny offsets, and an exponential overload term. Instead, make a localized in-family change to the compressive accumulator's shape. A two-timescale sublinear function—such as a dominant rapidly compressing component plus a smaller logarithmic tail—can give strong evidence at margin 1, little additional growth from 1 to 5, and continued mild growth from 5 through 13. This directly addresses Experiment 8 while preserving the accepted base's good Experiments 3 and 10 performance and strengthening the small-margin effects needed in Experiments 1 and 4. Calibrate the three anchor points explicitly rather than changing curvature and gain jointly: margin 1 should be stronger than in the accepted base, margin 5 should be approximately unchanged or slightly reduced, and margins 7–13 should retain enough slow-tail growth to keep Experiment 10 near 0.875.

For the validity channel, replace the problematic combination of power normalization and thresholded exponential overload with a smoother shrinkage normalization and a continuously decreasing capacity curve. A normalization such as division by sqrt(lambda + profile_energy^2) raised to a modest exponent can avoid disproportionately amplifying low-energy profiles, helping reduce Experiment 6 while preserving Experiment 5. Calibrate complexity attenuation separately at the observed display sizes: substantial validity access at 11 features, weaker access at 15, and near-negligible residual influence by 19 and 37 features. This should retain the small modulation required in Experiment 7 while moving Experiment 9 toward zero. Because Experiment 9 has a constant count margin, directly verify that the residual-validity contribution there is nearly flat across its discrimination-density sequence; changing only an n_features multiplier is insufficient unless the resulting residual channel is genuinely small. Finally, use mean-preserving subject heterogeneity rather than another blanket widening of all ranges—for example, dispersion in polarity confidence and count-channel gain around fixed means—so the low variances in Experiments 1 and 3–6 can increase without recreating Experiment 8's excessive variance.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2331 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1357 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The accepted iteration is a meaningful improvement and remains faithful to the prescribed mechanism family. It now fits Experiment 1 reasonably well (-0.3825 versus -0.4355), eliminates the unwanted density association in Experiment 9 (0.0939 versus -0.0407), and nearly exactly captures large-margin choice in Experiment 10 (0.8694 versus 0.8750). Experiment 3 is also close, and Experiment 2 is matched. The two-timescale accumulator and smooth capacity attenuation were therefore productive changes. Nevertheless, two important failures remain. Experiment 7 is severely overpredicted: the margin-one validity-alignment contrast is 0.4263 rather than 0.0392. The fast accumulator is allowing the first count increment to overwhelm or sharply reverse the validity-based tie behavior. Experiment 8 has improved dramatically from +268 to +44, but it still misses the observed -28 and therefore retains too much margin-1-to-margin-5 growth. There are secondary errors: adverse count alignment is too strong in Experiment 4 (-0.6538 versus -0.4825), and the validity channel has the wrong relative calibration across the two 11-feature experiments\u2014slightly too weak in Experiment 5 (0.1949 versus 0.2306) but substantially too strong in Experiment 6 (0.1999 versus 0.1062). Between-subject variance remains too low in Experiments 1, 3\u20136, and 10, while it is already too high for the Experiment 8 contrast, so blanket range widening would be inappropriate.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Build on this accepted candidate and retain the polarity-anchored absolute-margin architecture. The prior recommendation to introduce a fast component plus logarithmic tail was accepted and should be refined rather than replaced. First, reduce and narrow the logarithmic-tail gain. The current large-margin choice level is already correct because the fast component is saturated, whereas the remaining positive Experiment 8 contrast indicates excessive incremental evidence from margin 1 to margin 5. A smaller but still positive tail should move that contrast toward zero or modestly negative while preserving continued diminishing growth and leaving Experiment 10 close to 0.875. Avoid a broad reduction in count gain, which would sacrifice the successful large-margin fit. The excessive Experiment 7 contrast and Experiment 4 alignment require reducing the abrupt behavioral impact of the first count increment specifically when it competes with residual validity evidence. Rebalance the smooth capacity curve rather than adding density scaling: use lower baseline validity gain at 11 cues but a later/flatter capacity knee so relative validity access at 15 cues is not reduced as strongly. More validity competition at 15 cues should prevent the margin-one count signal from producing the enormous Experiment 7 reversal, while attenuation can remain strong by 19 and 37 cues to preserve Experiment 9. For the Experiment 5/6 dissociation, move reliability standardization still closer to zero or make shrinkage more dominant, then retune overall attention modestly; the current normalization disproportionately strengthens the smoother, lower-energy Experiment 6 profile. Finally, narrow heterogeneity in the tail parameter to reduce Experiment 8 variance, while modestly increasing mean-preserving heterogeneity in stable polarity confidence or validity attention to raise the broadly underestimated subject variances. This should be a localized recalibration of the accepted model, not another change of mechanism family."
