# generation_iter_02_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Replace pi_6 with a new task-invariant theory of semantic-polarity inference and display-invariant compressive evidence accumulation. The new theory should retain a stable subject-level interpretation of whether marks are adverse or beneficial, but represent the tally margin through a flexible sublinear function of the absolute count difference—such as a signed power/logarithmic accumulator followed by mild saturation—whose scale depends on margin magnitude rather than on the fraction or number of discriminating cues. This should yield no systematic sparse-versus-dense effect when count and validity evidence are fixed, as required by Experiment 1, while producing continued but diminishing growth from moderate to large margins: stronger than pi_6's near-immediate saturation yet far weaker than pi_4's linear extrapolation, as required jointly by Experiments 2 and 10. Add a modest, continuously available count-residualized validity channel, with partial reliability standardization and attentional attenuation as display complexity increases, but do not impose pi_6's discrimination-fraction scaling or strong conflict normalization. Allow stable subject heterogeneity in count curvature, validity attention, polarity confidence, and precision so the model can reproduce the elevated variances in several experiments. The critical competitor should therefore predict: condition invariance in Experiment 1; approximately 0.875 fewer-mark choices at large margins in Experiment 2; an intermediate margin contrast near -28 in Experiment 10; and weaker validity slopes in Experiments 8 and 9 without eliminating the validity modulation seen in Experiment 7.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.696)

**Description**
Discrepancy-Evoked Residual Audit with Capacity-Limited Tie Escalation: people first form an adverse-markedness preference from a nonlinear count difference, while count-residualized validity information remains continuously available. Count discrepancies evoke an additional validity audit, but exact count ties trigger a distinct escalation because tallying provides no provisional winner. This tie escalation is strongest when the cue set fits within a fixed attentional capacity and rapidly dilutes as the number of cues exceeds that capacity. Stable subject differences in tie escalation complement existing differences in count reliance, discrepancy auditing, semantic polarity, precision, and lapses.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.645)

**Description**
Semantic-Polarity Smooth Integration theory: people first interpret what the marked binary state means rather than assuming that 1 is intrinsically desirable. Each subject forms a stable posterior belief that a mark is adverse or suspicious. Conditional on either the adverse interpretation or its residual beneficial alternative, the subject smoothly integrates two continuous signals: the difference in total marks and a partially count-residualized validity-weighted difference. The count signal normally dominates, while the weighted signal supplies graded sensitivity to which experts carry the marks on every trial. The two semantic interpretations generate opposite choice distributions, which are averaged according to the subject's polarity confidence. A small lapse process captures stimulus-independent errors.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.419)

**Description**
Capacity-Calibrated Dual-Channel Integration theory: people continuously integrate a rapid representation of the relative number of marked ratings with a validity-sensitive representation of where those marks occur. Neither representation is encoded in raw additive units. The count channel expresses the tally margin relative to the proportion of displayed cues that discriminate and then passes it through a smooth saturating response, so large margins remain decisive without producing indefinitely increasing evidence. A stable discrimination-scaling exponent governs how strongly sparse cue sets dilute count evidence. The validity channel represents count-residualized reliability evidence using softly standardized units and divisively normalizes it according to display size, the number of discriminating cues, and cue conflict. Partial rather than full reliability-energy standardization preserves psychologically meaningful differences between sharply separated and shallow validity profiles without allowing low-dispersion profiles to become artificially amplified. Validity remains available on every trial, including count ties, but there are no special tie, audit, or selected-margin rules. A stable allocation parameter controls the balance between channels. Capacity also contracts the behavioral expression of individual differences in allocation and precision as displays become large, yielding appreciable heterogeneity in compact tasks but more homogeneous behavior in very high-dimensional tasks. Stable semantic-polarity confidence determines whether marked states are interpreted as adverse or beneficial, while stable response precision and lapse rate govern stochasticity.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1753 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2331 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1753 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Polarity-Anchored Diminishing-Margin Integration theory: subjects form a stable semantic belief about whether a displayed mark denotes an adverse or beneficial property. Conditional on that interpretation, the tally channel encodes only the signed absolute count margin, independently of display density and the number or fraction of discriminating cues. Count evidence follows a subject-specific offset power law and then undergoes only mild saturation, producing continued but diminishing growth from small through large margins. A separate, continuously available validity channel represents the component of reliability-weighted evidence left after removing mean-validity count evidence. This residual is partially standardized by the overall reliability-profile energy and attenuated smoothly as the full display exceeds attentional capacity. Stable individual differences in margin curvature, count gain, validity attention, capacity, semantic-polarity confidence, precision, and lapses generate persistent between-subject heterogeneity.

`rationale`: The model directly removes pi_6's principal failure: count evidence is never divided by display size, discrimination fraction, cue conflict, or the number of discriminating cues. Trials with the same tally margin therefore receive the same count signal, supporting the required sparse-versus-dense invariance in Experiments 1 and 9. Unlike pi_6's near-immediate tanh saturation, the offset power law continues to grow between margins 1, 5, and the larger margins in Experiment 10. Its curvature below one and high saturation threshold nevertheless make that growth much weaker than pi_4's linear extrapolation, targeting an intermediate Experiment 8 margin contrast while retaining strong fewer-mark choices at large margins in Experiments 3 and 10. The validity channel is fully count-residualized and always active, avoiding special tie or selected-margin rules. Its soft profile-level standardization does not introduce trial-specific density normalization, while display-load attenuation weakens validity effects in the 19- and 37-feature tasks without removing the modulation in the 15-feature task. Broad subject-level ranges in curvature, validity attention, capacity, polarity, and precision are intended to recover the substantial observed heterogeneity rather than artificially contracting it on large displays.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed mechanism family and improves the large-margin prediction: Experiment 10 is close to the target (0.9016 versus 0.8750), and Experiments 2 and 3 also show the correct qualitative behavior. However, it fails the central margin-contrast constraint spectacularly. In Experiment 8, the predicted contrast is +268 rather than the observed -28, indicating far too much growth in fewer-mark choice between margins 1 and 5. This is not an intermediate extrapolation between immediate saturation and linear accumulation. Experiment 9 also shows a substantial unintended density association (-1.3435 versus -0.0407), despite the intended display invariance. Smaller but systematic errors occur in Experiments 1 and 4, where adverse tally alignment is too weak, and in Experiments 5–7, where the validity channel is underpowered in Experiment 5 but overpowered in Experiments 6 and 7. Between-subject variance is also markedly underestimated in Experiments 1, 3–6, and 10.
Rationale: Retain the polarity-anchored, absolute-margin, count-residualized-validity architecture, but recalibrate it. The count transform currently allocates too little evidence to small margins and far too much incremental evidence from margin 1 to 5. Use lower count curvature and a compensating gain/offset adjustment that raises margin-1 evidence while holding or slightly reducing evidence at margins 5 and above. This should move Experiment 8 sharply downward, strengthen the underpredicted tally effects in Experiments 1 and 4, and slightly reduce the overprediction in Experiments 3 and 10 without reverting to pi_6-style immediate saturation. Separately, suppress validity-induced density effects on larger displays: strengthen display-load attenuation above roughly 11 features while compensating with modestly higher baseline validity attention so Experiment 5 is not weakened further. Reducing the reliability-standardization exponent may also help distinguish Experiments 5 and 6, because the present normalization appears to amplify the smoother validity profile in Experiment 6 disproportionately. These changes should reduce the excessive Experiment 7 modulation and bring Experiment 9 toward zero. Finally, widen subject heterogeneity primarily in count curvature/gain and precision rather than adding trial-specific normalization; current variances are much too contracted in most small and medium displays. The current iteration was accepted by the gate, so it is a useful base, but the sign-and-magnitude failure in Experiment 8 is too large to ship.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1753 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2331 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is faithful to the prescribed polarity-anchored, absolute-margin family, but it is decisively worse than the accepted iteration and was rejected by the gate (loss 0.2331 versus 0.1753). The previous coordinated push toward very low curvature, tiny offsets, stronger overload attenuation, and greater validity attention did not work and should not be repeated. Most importantly, Experiment 8 moved farther from the required intermediate margin contrast: +326 versus the observed -28, compared with +268 in the accepted base. At the same time, large-margin behavior became too weak in Experiments 3 (0.5967 versus 0.7367) and 10 (0.8194 versus 0.8750). Thus the revised power law reduced overall large-margin evidence without solving the excessive margin-1-to-margin-5 contrast. Tally effects also weakened in Experiments 1 and 4. The validity recalibration produced mixed and unstable results: Experiment 5 improved, but Experiment 6 worsened, Experiment 7 remains much too positive, and Experiment 9 crossed from a negative error to an even larger positive error (2.6317 versus -0.0407). Because feature count is constant within Experiment 9, a display-level overload multiplier cannot by itself remove that trial-level density association; the relevant problem is the balance between the count signal and validity residual across those stimuli. Between-subject variance remains too low in Experiments 1 and 3–6, although the current broad widening overshoots variance in Experiment 8 and therefore is not an adequate general solution.
Rationale: Build the next candidate on the unchanged accepted iteration-1 base, but do not repeat the rejected package of lower curvature, tiny offsets, and an exponential overload term. Instead, make a localized in-family change to the compressive accumulator's shape. A two-timescale sublinear function—such as a dominant rapidly compressing component plus a smaller logarithmic tail—can give strong evidence at margin 1, little additional growth from 1 to 5, and continued mild growth from 5 through 13. This directly addresses Experiment 8 while preserving the accepted base's good Experiments 3 and 10 performance and strengthening the small-margin effects needed in Experiments 1 and 4. Calibrate the three anchor points explicitly rather than changing curvature and gain jointly: margin 1 should be stronger than in the accepted base, margin 5 should be approximately unchanged or slightly reduced, and margins 7–13 should retain enough slow-tail growth to keep Experiment 10 near 0.875.

For the validity channel, replace the problematic combination of power normalization and thresholded exponential overload with a smoother shrinkage normalization and a continuously decreasing capacity curve. A normalization such as division by sqrt(lambda + profile_energy^2) raised to a modest exponent can avoid disproportionately amplifying low-energy profiles, helping reduce Experiment 6 while preserving Experiment 5. Calibrate complexity attenuation separately at the observed display sizes: substantial validity access at 11 features, weaker access at 15, and near-negligible residual influence by 19 and 37 features. This should retain the small modulation required in Experiment 7 while moving Experiment 9 toward zero. Because Experiment 9 has a constant count margin, directly verify that the residual-validity contribution there is nearly flat across its discrimination-density sequence; changing only an n_features multiplier is insufficient unless the resulting residual channel is genuinely small. Finally, use mean-preserving subject heterogeneity rather than another blanket widening of all ranges—for example, dispersion in polarity confidence and count-channel gain around fixed means—so the low variances in Experiments 1 and 3–6 can increase without recreating Experiment 8's excessive variance.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2331 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "rationale": "This is a localized edit of the accepted architecture. The offset power law is replaced by the critic-recommended two-timescale accumulator. Its fast component gives margin 1 almost all of the dominant count evidence, sharply reducing the excessive margin-1-to-margin-5 growth responsible for Experiment 8's +268 contrast. The small logarithmic tail still distinguishes margins 5 through 13, while the count-gain range preserves strong large-margin choices in Experiments 3 and 10. Because this transform uses only absolute margin, it introduces no sparse-versus-dense count scaling. The validity channel remains count-residualized and continuously active, but profile normalization now uses smooth shrinkage rather than a potentially amplifying raw power denominator. The revised continuous capacity curve leaves appreciable validity access at 11 cues, declines around 15 cues, and becomes small at 19 and 37 cues, targeting the Experiment 5–7 ordering and suppressing the unwanted Experiment 9 density association. Finally, response precision is widened around essentially the same midpoint as before, increasing subject heterogeneity without substantially shifting mean predictions."
