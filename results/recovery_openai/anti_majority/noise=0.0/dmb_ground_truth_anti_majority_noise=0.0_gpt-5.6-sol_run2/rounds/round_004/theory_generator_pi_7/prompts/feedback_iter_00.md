# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Replace pi_6 with a new task-invariant theory of semantic-polarity inference and display-invariant compressive evidence accumulation. The new theory should retain a stable subject-level interpretation of whether marks are adverse or beneficial, but represent the tally margin through a flexible sublinear function of the absolute count difference—such as a signed power/logarithmic accumulator followed by mild saturation—whose scale depends on margin magnitude rather than on the fraction or number of discriminating cues. This should yield no systematic sparse-versus-dense effect when count and validity evidence are fixed, as required by Experiment 1, while producing continued but diminishing growth from moderate to large margins: stronger than pi_6's near-immediate saturation yet far weaker than pi_4's linear extrapolation, as required jointly by Experiments 2 and 10. Add a modest, continuously available count-residualized validity channel, with partial reliability standardization and attentional attenuation as display complexity increases, but do not impose pi_6's discrimination-fraction scaling or strong conflict normalization. Allow stable subject heterogeneity in count curvature, validity attention, polarity confidence, and precision so the model can reproduce the elevated variances in several experiments. The critical competitor should therefore predict: condition invariance in Experiment 1; approximately 0.875 fewer-mark choices at large margins in Experiment 2; an intermediate margin contrast near -28 in Experiment 10; and weaker validity slopes in Experiments 8 and 9 without eliminating the validity modulation seen in Experiment 7.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Polarity-Anchored Diminishing-Margin Integration theory: subjects form a stable semantic belief about whether a displayed mark denotes an adverse or beneficial property. Conditional on that interpretation, the tally channel encodes only the signed absolute count margin, independently of display density and the number or fraction of discriminating cues. Count evidence follows a subject-specific offset power law and then undergoes only mild saturation, producing continued but diminishing growth from small through large margins. A separate, continuously available validity channel represents the component of reliability-weighted evidence left after removing mean-validity count evidence. This residual is partially standardized by the overall reliability-profile energy and attenuated smoothly as the full display exceeds attentional capacity. Stable individual differences in margin curvature, count gain, validity attention, capacity, semantic-polarity confidence, precision, and lapses generate persistent between-subject heterogeneity.

`rationale`:
The model directly removes pi_6's principal failure: count evidence is never divided by display size, discrimination fraction, cue conflict, or the number of discriminating cues. Trials with the same tally margin therefore receive the same count signal, supporting the required sparse-versus-dense invariance in Experiments 1 and 9. Unlike pi_6's near-immediate tanh saturation, the offset power law continues to grow between margins 1, 5, and the larger margins in Experiment 10. Its curvature below one and high saturation threshold nevertheless make that growth much weaker than pi_4's linear extrapolation, targeting an intermediate Experiment 8 margin contrast while retaining strong fewer-mark choices at large margins in Experiments 3 and 10. The validity channel is fully count-residualized and always active, avoiding special tie or selected-margin rules. Its soft profile-level standardization does not introduce trial-specific density normalization, while display-load attenuation weakens validity effects in the 19- and 37-feature tasks without removing the modulation in the 15-feature task. Broad subject-level ranges in curvature, validity attention, capacity, polarity, and precision are intended to recover the substantial observed heterogeneity rather than artificially contracting it on large displays.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1753 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1753.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is faithful to the prescribed mechanism family and improves the large-margin prediction: Experiment 10 is close to the target (0.9016 versus 0.8750), and Experiments 2 and 3 also show the correct qualitative behavior. However, it fails the central margin-contrast constraint spectacularly. In Experiment 8, the predicted contrast is +268 rather than the observed -28, indicating far too much growth in fewer-mark choice between margins 1 and 5. This is not an intermediate extrapolation between immediate saturation and linear accumulation. Experiment 9 also shows a substantial unintended density association (-1.3435 versus -0.0407), despite the intended display invariance. Smaller but systematic errors occur in Experiments 1 and 4, where adverse tally alignment is too weak, and in Experiments 5\u20137, where the validity channel is underpowered in Experiment 5 but overpowered in Experiments 6 and 7. Between-subject variance is also markedly underestimated in Experiments 1, 3\u20136, and 10.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Retain the polarity-anchored, absolute-margin, count-residualized-validity architecture, but recalibrate it. The count transform currently allocates too little evidence to small margins and far too much incremental evidence from margin 1 to 5. Use lower count curvature and a compensating gain/offset adjustment that raises margin-1 evidence while holding or slightly reducing evidence at margins 5 and above. This should move Experiment 8 sharply downward, strengthen the underpredicted tally effects in Experiments 1 and 4, and slightly reduce the overprediction in Experiments 3 and 10 without reverting to pi_6-style immediate saturation. Separately, suppress validity-induced density effects on larger displays: strengthen display-load attenuation above roughly 11 features while compensating with modestly higher baseline validity attention so Experiment 5 is not weakened further. Reducing the reliability-standardization exponent may also help distinguish Experiments 5 and 6, because the present normalization appears to amplify the smoother validity profile in Experiment 6 disproportionately. These changes should reduce the excessive Experiment 7 modulation and bring Experiment 9 toward zero. Finally, widen subject heterogeneity primarily in count curvature/gain and precision rather than adding trial-specific normalization; current variances are much too contracted in most small and medium displays. The current iteration was accepted by the gate, so it is a useful base, but the sign-and-magnitude failure in Experiment 8 is too large to ship."
