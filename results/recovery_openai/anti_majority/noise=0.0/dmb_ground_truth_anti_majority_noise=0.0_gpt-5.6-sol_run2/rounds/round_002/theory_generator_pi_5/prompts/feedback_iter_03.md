# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_3`).

Replace pi_3 with a task-invariant hierarchical audit theory of adverse markedness. Subjects should first form a provisional preference from the marked-count difference, but validity information must remain continuously available rather than being excluded on non-ties. Its influence should be modulated by trial structure: use a nonzero baseline validity gain on count ties and a stronger discrepancy-triggered validity audit when counts differ, allowing the validity slope to be larger in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2. A suitable evidence architecture is an adverse-polarity signal combining a nonlinear count term with a count-margin-modulated, count-residualized validity term, for example E = alpha*f(count_difference) + beta*g(abs(count_difference))*residualized_validity_difference, with g(0) greater than zero and g(1) permitted to exceed g(0). The count function should become strong or saturating at large margins, preserving the markedness choices in Experiments 3, 5, and 6. Include stable subject-level variation in count reliance, validity-audit propensity, semantic polarity, precision, and lapse rate to reproduce the consistently elevated observed variances. This theory differs from pi_3 by rejecting the hard count gate and differs from pi_4 by making validity gain structurally conditional rather than uniformly smooth. It should be tested against pi_4 using joint parameter constraints across all experiments, especially the requirement to produce approximately 0.23 validity sensitivity for one-mark count conflicts while producing only approximately 0.11 on equal-count redistributions.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Discrepancy-Evoked Residual Audit theory: people make binary-feature choices using a hierarchical but non-gated process. They first construct a provisional preference from the difference in the number of marked states, interpreting marks as adverse by default. This count signal is nonlinear and saturates, so sufficiently large count margins yield a stable preference for the less-marked option. An additional extreme-margin tail makes count evidence selectively more decisive once the absolute count difference reaches five. Validity information nevertheless remains continuously available. It is represented as a validity-weighted difference after removing the component that merely duplicates total mark count. On equal-count trials this residual signal receives a nonzero baseline gain. A small count discrepancy triggers an additional audit because it creates a plausible conflict between the provisional tally and the identities of the experts supporting it. Audit gain is strongest near a one-mark discrepancy and declines at large margins, while a smaller localized audit is evoked specifically at a three-mark discrepancy. Subjects differ stably in count reliance, audit propensity, semantic polarity, response precision, and lapse rate. Thus, the model predicts stronger validity sensitivity in one-mark conflicts than in equal-count redistributions, additional scrutiny of intermediate discrepancies, and robust adverse-markedness choices at extreme margins.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal edit to the accepted iteration-1 model. The tie baseline, margin-one audit, global count curve, precision, polarity, and lapse distributions are unchanged, preserving the near-joint fits in Experiments 4–6. A small audit increment is added only when the count margin is exactly three, so it can alter the intermediate conflicts represented in Experiment 1 without affecting Experiment 4's margin-one/two trials, Experiment 5's margin-one slope, Experiment 6's count ties, or Experiment 3's diagnostic extreme margins. Separately, an adverse-polarity count tail activates only at margins of at least five. This directly targets the underpredicted large-margin markedness in Experiment 3 and should also strengthen the decisive conflict trials in Experiment 1, while leaving the successful small-margin predictions intact. Subject variation is introduced only in these two localized mechanisms, avoiding the rejected strategy of broadly widening polarity, precision, or lapse ranges.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0711 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0773 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0729 -> REJECTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0632 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.0632.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate successfully captures the recommendation’s central cross-experiment signature: validity sensitivity is strong for one-mark conflicts in Experiment 5 (0.2545 versus 0.2306 observed) but much weaker on equal-count redistributions in Experiment 6 (0.0993 versus 0.1062). It also matches Experiment 4 closely (-0.4958 versus -0.4825) and passes Experiment 2. However, it is not yet experiment-invariant enough. Experiment 1 is substantially attenuated (-0.2312 versus -0.4355), indicating too little differentiation between tally ties and count-conflict trials. Experiment 3 also underpredicts adverse markedness at large margins (0.6167 versus 0.7367), so the saturating count signal is not decisive enough. In addition, between-subject variance is systematically too low: for example, 0.0168 versus 0.0764 in Experiment 1, 0.0302 versus 0.0708 in Experiment 4, 0.0084 versus 0.0353 in Experiment 5, and 0.0035 versus 0.0136 in Experiment 6. Thus, the mean audit contrast is convincing, but stable heterogeneity and the margin profile remain miscalibrated.
Rationale: Keep the discrepancy-evoked residual-audit family, which is strongly supported by the near-joint match to Experiments 5 and 6, but tune it further. First, reshape rather than globally increase validity gain: Experiment 5 is already slightly too validity-sensitive, while Experiment 1 needs a much stronger tie-versus-conflict contrast. A sharper margin-one audit activation, potentially normalized by the trial’s validity spread or residual-evidence scale, should increase structural contrast without simply raising all one-mark slopes. Preserve the current nonzero tie baseline because Experiment 6 is nearly exact. Second, strengthen large-margin count evidence selectively. A less prematurely saturated count curve—or jointly increasing count scale and strength while holding margin-one evidence approximately fixed—could raise Experiment 3 without materially disturbing the good Experiment 4 fit. Finally, substantially widen effective subject-level heterogeneity in count reliance, audit propensity, polarity, precision, and lapse while recentering distributions to preserve pooled means. The present parameterization nominally includes these dimensions but does not generate anything close to the observed variance, especially for the validity-slope metrics. These are in-family calibration changes, not a change of mechanism.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0711 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0773 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed discrepancy-evoked residual-audit family and retains several successes: Experiment 2 is correct, Experiment 4 is essentially exact (-0.4796 versus -0.4825), and the key conditional-validity ordering remains present, with greater sensitivity in Experiment 5 (0.2136) than Experiment 6 (0.0837). However, this iteration was rejected because aggregate loss increased from 0.0711 to 0.0773. Although Experiment 1 improved modestly and several variances increased, the revision degraded two important fits: large-margin adverse markedness in Experiment 3 fell from 0.6167 to 0.5783, moving farther from 0.7367, and the equal-count validity slope in Experiment 6 fell from 0.0993 to 0.0837, moving away from 0.1062. Experiment 1 also remains substantially too weakly negative (-0.2687 versus -0.4355), and its variance remains far too low (0.0258 versus 0.0764). The Gaussian audit appears too narrowly concentrated at margin one, while the widened polarity/precision heterogeneity likely attenuates aggregate adverse responding despite the stronger nominal count asymptote.
Rationale: Because this iteration was rejected, build on the unchanged iteration-1 base rather than repeating the rejected combination of a Gaussian margin-one audit, jointly stronger count saturation, and broadly widened heterogeneity. Try a different in-family calibration: give discrepancy-triggered auditing a margin-one peak plus a limited shoulder at margins two to three, while suppressing it only at genuinely large margins such as five or more. This can strengthen the Experiment 1 tie-versus-conflict contrast without allowing validity evidence to erode the strong-count trials in Experiment 3. Preserve the iteration-1 tie baseline, which already produced the near-exact Experiment 6 slope, rather than lowering its effective influence. To improve Experiment 3, avoid further broadening semantic-polarity and lapse distributions; instead, constrain adverse-polarity confidence toward the adverse interpretation and keep lapses modest, since widening those dimensions appears to have canceled the intended increase in large-margin count evidence. Add missing variance more selectively through mean-preserving heterogeneity in baseline validity gain and audit propensity, especially for the slope metrics, rather than through polarity or global precision. The next target should jointly restore Experiment 6 near 0.10, raise Experiment 3 toward 0.74, retain Experiment 5 near 0.23 and Experiment 4 near -0.48, and make Experiment 1 more negative through moderate-margin auditing rather than a global validity increase.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0773 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0729 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed discrepancy-evoked residual-audit family and still captures its central qualitative signature: validity sensitivity is stronger for one-mark conflicts in Experiment 5 (0.2184) than for equal-count redistributions in Experiment 6 (0.0891). It also passes Experiment 2 and remains highly accurate in Experiment 4 (-0.4979 versus -0.4825). Nevertheless, the current iteration was rejected by the gate because its loss, 0.0729, exceeds the accepted iteration-1 loss of 0.0711. Relative to that accepted base, the broad margin-two/three audit shoulder improved Experiment 1 but did not close its large gap (-0.2828 versus -0.4355), while large-margin markedness in Experiment 3 deteriorated sharply from 0.6167 to 0.5517 instead of approaching 0.7367. Experiment 6 also moved away from its previously near-exact fit, from 0.0993 to 0.0891 versus 0.1062 observed. Between-subject variance remains too low in Experiments 1, 4, 5, and 6. Thus the mechanism is promising, but the latest smooth shoulder and count-range adjustment are not experiment-invariant improvements.
Rationale: Build on the unchanged iteration-1 base and do not repeat the rejected broad margin-two/three shoulder or another general widening of heterogeneity. Use more localized in-family margin shaping. Experiment 1 contains informative non-tie conflicts at margins one, three, and five, whereas Experiment 5 principally identifies the margin-one audit and is already close to target. Keep the accepted base's margin-one gain and tie baseline, then add a smaller, separately parameterized audit bump centered specifically at margin three, with negligible activation at margin two and a hard or very steep suppression by margin five. This should make Experiment 1 more negative without lowering the already good Experiment 5 slope, perturbing Experiment 4's margin-one/two choices, or allowing validity evidence into Experiment 3's decisive trials. Separately strengthen only the extreme-margin branch of the nonlinear count signal—for example, an additive saturating tail activated around |count_difference| >= 5—rather than jointly changing global count strength and scale. That targets Experiment 3 while preserving the accepted base's fits at small margins. Restore the iteration-1 baseline-validity and precision distributions to recover Experiment 6 near 0.10. Because indiscriminate range widening was rejected, address variance only through localized heterogeneity in the new margin-three audit parameter and extreme-margin count-tail parameter; avoid broadening polarity, lapse, or global precision. The immediate targets are Experiment 1 near -0.44 and Experiment 3 near 0.74 while retaining Experiments 4–6 at approximately -0.48, 0.23, and 0.11.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0729 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0632 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

  "interpretation": "The accepted revision is a genuine improvement and remains faithful to the prescribed discrepancy-evoked residual-audit family. The extreme-margin count tail successfully raises Experiment 3 from 0.6167 in the previous accepted base to 0.6733, with variance nearly exact (0.0500 versus 0.0520). Experiments 4 and 5 are also excellent at the pooled level (-0.4892 versus -0.4825 and 0.2247 versus 0.2306), Experiment 2 passes, and the key conditional-validity signature is preserved: one-mark sensitivity in Experiment 5 is substantially greater than equal-count sensitivity in Experiment 6. However, Experiment 1 remains the decisive failure: -0.2467 is much less negative than the observed -0.4355. The localized margin-three audit produced only a small improvement over the iteration-1 base and is worse than the rejected broad-shoulder model on this metric, suggesting that additional validity auditing at margin three is not the most effective way to generate the required conflict alignment. Experiment 6 is also modestly low at 0.0889 versus 0.1062. Finally, stable heterogeneity remains insufficient: variance is markedly underestimated in Experiments 1, 4, 5, and 6, despite the good Experiment 3 variance.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Build on this accepted candidate because the localized extreme-count tail clearly helped, but make a different localized adjustment for Experiment 1. Its conflict trials span margins one through five, and stronger adverse count evidence makes their choices align with the first discriminating cue; the remaining attenuation therefore points to insufficient moderate-margin count decisiveness rather than too little margin-three validity auditing. Reduce or hold fixed the margin-three audit bump and add a bounded intermediate count reinforcement concentrated at margins three and four, with negligible activation at margins one and two and no added growth beyond the existing extreme branch at margin five. This stays within the recommended nonlinear count-plus-conditional-audit architecture while protecting Experiment 4's margin-one/two fit, Experiment 5's margin-one slope, Experiment 6's ties, and the newly improved Experiment 3 extreme margins. Do not repeat the rejected broad audit shoulder or broad widening of polarity, precision, and lapse. If further variance calibration is attempted, use mean-preserving correlated heterogeneity in count reliance and audit propensity rather than wider independent global ranges; the current means are mostly strong, but the model still makes subjects too homogeneous. A very small upward recentering of baseline validity gain may also recover Experiment 6, but it should be secondary to the moderate-margin count correction and constrained so Experiment 5 remains near 0.23."
