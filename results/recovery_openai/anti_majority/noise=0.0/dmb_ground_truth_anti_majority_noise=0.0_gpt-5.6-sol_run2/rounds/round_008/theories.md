**Description:** Relative-Evidence Conflict Arbitration theory: people construct two density-invariant summaries of a binary-feature display. A signed count accumulator represents only the difference in the numbers of marks carried by the options. It grows approximately linearly across ordinary margins and saturates only at relatively large margins, so adding equal numbers of opposing marks cannot dilute count evidence. In parallel, communicated validities are centered around their profile mean and bound to cue directions. Access to this reliability residual is governed by its absolute magnitude and signed coherence: consistently directed reliability contributions become accessible, whereas additions containing genuinely opposing contributions reduce access by increasing gross support without increasing the residual. Accessibility never depends directly on display size, the number of discriminating cues, or active-validity dispersion. A shallow, band-limited calibration discounts intermediate reliability magnitudes but recovers for genuinely strong residuals, representing temporary ambiguity in mapping moderately accumulated reliability evidence onto a categorical preference rather than generic overload. The two summaries are combined by relative-evidence arbitration. Congruent summaries receive modest mutual reinforcement. During conflict, balanced channels inhibit confidence, while sufficiently asymmetric conflicts recruit a winner-enhancement process favoring whichever signed summary is stronger. Thus pure count problems show robust margin growth, but structured count-reliability conflicts can be compressed or reversed without invoking density overload. After arbitration, a mild bounded-confidence transformation imposes diminishing decisional returns on repeatedly accumulated coherent evidence without altering the raw channel ratio used to resolve conflicts. Stable but moderate differences in channel balance and response precision coexist with stable semantic polarity and occasional lapses.

**Rationale:** This is an isolated parameter-range recalibration of the accepted iteration-6 model; no prediction equation, notch, arbitration branch, terminal bound, or sampling policy has been changed. The reliability floor is modestly lowered, while coherence gain and coherence curvature are increased. Consequently, weak or internally opposed signed reliability contributions receive less influence, targeting the insufficient tally dominance in Experiment 1 and the excessive reliability-related contrasts in Experiments 7 and 9. The magnitude half-saturation is lowered so moderate but highly coherent residuals remain accessible, protecting and potentially strengthening the structured reliability effects needed in Experiments 5 and 8. The midpoint of reliability_floor plus coherence_gain remains approximately unchanged from the accepted base, preserving asymptotic high-coherence reliability strength for Experiments 10, 11, and 13. The successful recovering magnitude notch is retained verbatim to protect the negative Experiment 16 result. Because only parameter domains changed, matched parameter dictionaries produce exactly the same probabilities as iteration 6 on every stimulus, including all count-neutral Experiment 16 trials; this avoids the hidden branch collateral effects seen in the two rejected edits.

### slot 2 — `pi_9` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Channel-Specific Coherence Integration theory: binary counts and cue reliabilities are encoded by distinct cognitive channels before being combined. The count channel rapidly computes the difference between option-level numbers of marked ratings. It depends only on that signed margin, so adding mutually canceling cues does not dilute count evidence. Its response is smooth and bounded, reflecting saturation of an approximate magnitude representation rather than unlimited linear accumulation. The reliability channel instead binds each discriminating cue's identity to its communicated validity. It first removes the validity component redundant with the count margin and then measures the signed coherence of the remaining cue-validity contributions. A reliability residual supported by mutually consistent contributions receives high gain, whereas the same residual embedded in opposing contributions receives lower gain because maintaining the required cue-identity bindings is difficult. This loss is determined by evidence coherence and communicated validity-profile contrast, not by feature count, diagnostic-cue count, or a generic load threshold. Stable subject differences govern relative allocation to the two channels and response precision. A stable semantic-polarity belief determines whether marks are interpreted as adverse or beneficial, and a small lapse process captures stimulus-independent choices.

**Rationale:** The model directly addresses the prior mechanistic failures by making count and reliability genuinely different summaries. Count evidence is a bounded function of signed margin alone. Consequently, adding any number of mutually canceling cues leaves it unchanged, predicting the count invariance required by Experiments 2, 11, and 14 while avoiding pi_8's diagnostic-load compression. Gradual tanh saturation preserves strong large-margin choices in Experiments 3 and 10 but limits the excessive linear margin separation seen for pi_4 in Experiment 8 and supports a moderate trajectory in Experiment 12. Reliability modulation is independently identified: coherence is the absolute residual divided by the absolute reliability support, so two trials can have identical residuals, margins, diagnostic counts, and display sizes while differing in internal cancellation. This predicts positive attenuation in Experiment 13 and weaker reliability influence in internally opposing conditions such as Experiment 1. Coherent high-versus-low profiles retain substantial reliability sensitivity, supporting Experiment 11, while the continuously varying coherence and profile terms produce intermediate rather than all-or-none reliability slopes in Experiments 6–9 and 13. There is no feature-count term, generic overload variable, capacity threshold, or late-load knee. Broad style and precision ranges create stable subject heterogeneity, while centered reliability evidence, global semantic reversal, and symmetric lapse mixing preserve A/B reversal symmetry.

## Replacement

### `pi_11` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Contrast-Calibrated Reliability-Precision Competition theory: people encode a binary-feature display through two stable-polarity evidence channels. The count channel accumulates only the signed difference in marks and is therefore invariant to additions that cancel in the tally. It saturates smoothly after relatively small margins, while retaining a substantial precision floor, so ordinary and large margins differ less sharply in confidence. The reliability channel computes centered validity evidence but treats that residual as an uncertain estimate. Its precision is inferred jointly from residual magnitude, signed coherence, and active-field validity contrast relative to the characteristic dispersion of the communicated validity profile. Weak residuals retain partial availability through a confidence-weighted precision floor: coherent residuals in a distinct validity field remain available, whereas diffuse weak residuals receive little precision. Reliability is selectively diluted when active validity contrast falls relative to the full validity field, rather than merely because more cues are active. Count and reliability estimates enter a smooth precision-weighted competition: count controls choices when reliability is uncertain, whereas sufficiently precise coherent reliability can dominate count or resolve count ties. Broad continuous subject variation in count weighting, relative channel precision, and response precision produces persistent heterogeneity without discrete strategy classes.

**Rationale:** This is a minimal in-family edit of the accepted candidate. First, active contrast is divided by the full communicated profile's RMS dispersion before gating. The resulting dimensionless contrast pathway, combined with a smooth cubic mapping, strengthens detection of the deliberately declining active-field contrast in Experiment 16 without adding a raw feature-count term. Second, the coherence floor was raised and the magnitude and coherence powers were narrowed toward the intermediate setting requested by the critic. This preserves superlinear magnitude-by-coherence precision while reducing the severe Experiment 18 overshoot and should also weaken the unwanted Experiment 9 trajectory. Third, the reliability floor is no longer unconditional: it is multiplied by coherence and relative-contrast confidence. Its parameter range is modestly raised so weak but coherent, high-contrast residuals can counter excessive small-margin count control in Experiment 4, while diffuse weak evidence in Experiment 6 remains strongly downweighted. The count equations are unchanged to preserve the accepted fits in Experiments 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12. Only the count-precision, reliability-precision, and response-precision ranges were slightly broadened to increase continuous between-subject heterogeneity.
