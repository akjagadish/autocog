# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** This 24-feature design isolates magnitude-dependent reliability access and the competitor's intermediate-magnitude calibration notch while eliminating count evidence and reliability-coherence changes. The validity profile consists of 12 high/low pairs symmetric around 0.75. In each base condition, an increasing prefix of pairs discriminates: the higher-validity member marks A and the lower-validity member marks B. Consequently, A and B always have equal mark counts, every nonzero centered-validity contribution has the same positive sign, and reliability coherence is exactly 1. The centered-validity residual increases through 0.10, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.90, 1.20, 1.60, 2.00, 2.48, 2.96, 3.44, and 3.92. Channel-Specific Coherence Integration therefore predicts an exactly proportional latent reliability signal: for each subject, reliability_signal/R is constant across all 12 conditions, with only the common response mapping producing bounded observable probabilities. Relative-Evidence Conflict Arbitration necessarily violates that proportionality. Its magnitude-access term strongly increases reliability_signal/R between small and moderate residuals, its notch selectively discounts residuals around 1.6–2.2, and access recovers beyond that band. It thus predicts a curved profile with accelerating per-unit sensitivity at low magnitudes, localized attenuation around the intermediate conditions, and recovery at high magnitudes. The critical analysis fits each theory's common polarity, lapse, precision, and bounded response mapping and tests the residual-magnitude profile: a single linear latent trajectory supports the advocated theory, whereas the competitor predicts magnitude-specific curvature even though count margin and coherence never change. Every base pair is also A/B reversed. The 24 unique pairs are each repeated four times, yielding exactly 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 24 unique pairs × 4 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Channel-Specific Coherence Integration theory: binary counts and cue reliabilities are encoded by distinct cognitive channels before being combined. The count channel rapidly computes the difference between option-level numbers of marked ratings. It depends only on that signed margin, so adding mutually canceling cues does not dilute count evidence. Its response is smooth and bounded, reflecting saturation of an approximate magnitude representation rather than unlimited linear accumulation. The reliability channel instead binds each discriminating cue's identity to its communicated validity. It first removes the validity component redundant with the count margin and then measures the signed coherence of the remaining cue-validity contributions. A reliability residual supported by mutually consistent contributions receives high gain, whereas the same residual embedded in opposing contributions receives lower gain because maintaining the required cue-identity bindings is difficult. This loss is determined by evidence coherence and communicated validity-profile contrast, not by feature count, diagnostic-cue count, or a generic load threshold. Stable subject differences govern relative allocation to the two channels and response precision. A stable semantic-polarity belief determines whether marks are interpreted as adverse or beneficial, and a small lapse process captures stimulus-independent choices.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Relative-Evidence Conflict Arbitration theory: people construct two density-invariant summaries of a binary-feature display. A signed count accumulator represents only the difference in the numbers of marks carried by the options. It grows approximately linearly across ordinary margins and saturates only at relatively large margins, so adding equal numbers of opposing marks cannot dilute count evidence. In parallel, communicated validities are centered around their profile mean and bound to cue directions. Access to this reliability residual is governed by its absolute magnitude and signed coherence: consistently directed reliability contributions become accessible, whereas additions containing genuinely opposing contributions reduce access by increasing gross support without increasing the residual. Accessibility never depends directly on display size, the number of discriminating cues, or active-validity dispersion. A shallow, band-limited calibration discounts intermediate reliability magnitudes but recovers for genuinely strong residuals, representing temporary ambiguity in mapping moderately accumulated reliability evidence onto a categorical preference rather than generic overload. The two summaries are combined by relative-evidence arbitration. Congruent summaries receive modest mutual reinforcement. During conflict, balanced channels inhibit confidence, while sufficiently asymmetric conflicts recruit a winner-enhancement process favoring whichever signed summary is stronger. Thus pure count problems show robust margin growth, but structured count-reliability conflicts can be compressed or reversed without invoking density overload. After arbitration, a mild bounded-confidence transformation imposes diminishing decisional returns on repeatedly accumulated coherent evidence without altering the raw channel ratio used to resolve conflicts. Stable but moderate differences in channel balance and response precision coexist with stable semantic polarity and occasional lapses.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This metric measures the prevalence of weak responding when the coherent reliability residual is already large. Responses are first aligned across each A/B-reversed pair, so positive values always represent selection of the option favored by the dominant adverse-mark interpretation. It then averages aligned choices over the six largest-residual conditions and applies a bounded soft threshold centered at an aligned preference of 0.45. Channel-Specific Coherence Integration permits a substantial lower tail of subjects for whom low reliability-channel allocation, binding gain, and precision jointly leave even strong coherent residuals weakly expressed. Relative-Evidence Conflict Arbitration has narrower channel allocation and increasingly complete magnitude access at these residuals, so it predicts fewer such weak responders despite its intermediate notch. Using 48 trials per subject stabilizes the tail estimate, while the smooth threshold avoids the variance of a hard subject classification. The pooled implementation averages the same subject-level score used by the between-subject evaluation."
