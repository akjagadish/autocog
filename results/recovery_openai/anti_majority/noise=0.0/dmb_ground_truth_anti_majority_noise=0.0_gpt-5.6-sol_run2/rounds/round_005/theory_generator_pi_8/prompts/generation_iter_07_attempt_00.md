# generation_iter_07_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_7`).

Replace pi_7 with a Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration theory that is a stronger competitor to pi_4. Retain stable semantic-polarity inference, but reject both a fixed feature-count capacity curve and universally smooth, context-free integration. The new theory should propose that attention is allocated according to diagnostic structure—reliability contrast, organization/salience, redundancy, conflict, and the number or fraction of discriminating cues—rather than total displayed feature count alone. Consequently, a structured high-versus-low validity contrast can remain strongly available even in a 37-feature display, as required by Experiment 1. Count evidence should accumulate smoothly across ordinary margins, as required by Experiment 2, but undergo divisive normalization or context-dependent compression in dense, extreme, or highly redundant displays, allowing the attenuated margin contrast in Experiment 10 without imposing pi_7's abrupt margin-one saturation. Validity and count evidence should be represented jointly so that adding a count cue can change normalization and conflict, but the theory should not impose the large discontinuity rejected by Experiment 9 or a systematic density effect rejected by Experiment 11. Include stable subject-level latent differences—or a stable mixture between predominantly tally-oriented and reliability-sensitive integration policies—to reproduce the elevated observed variances while preserving polarity across experiments. The replacement must make falsifiable cross-task predictions from common parameters and should be calibrated simultaneously to all experiments, not by separate feature-count-specific knees.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.710)

**Description**
Discrepancy-Evoked Residual Audit with Capacity-Limited Tie Escalation: people first form an adverse-markedness preference from a nonlinear count difference, while count-residualized validity information remains continuously available. Count discrepancies evoke an additional validity audit, but exact count ties trigger a distinct escalation because tallying provides no provisional winner. This tie escalation is strongest when the cue set fits within a fixed attentional capacity and rapidly dilutes as the number of cues exceeds that capacity. Stable subject differences in tie escalation complement existing differences in count reliance, discrepancy auditing, semantic polarity, precision, and lapses.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.674)

**Description**
Semantic-Polarity Smooth Integration theory: people first interpret what the marked binary state means rather than assuming that 1 is intrinsically desirable. Each subject forms a stable posterior belief that a mark is adverse or suspicious. Conditional on either the adverse interpretation or its residual beneficial alternative, the subject smoothly integrates two continuous signals: the difference in total marks and a partially count-residualized validity-weighted difference. The count signal normally dominates, while the weighted signal supplies graded sensitivity to which experts carry the marks on every trial. The two semantic interpretations generate opposite choice distributions, which are averaged according to the subject's polarity confidence. A small lapse process captures stimulus-independent errors.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.379)

**Description**
Polarity-Anchored Dual-Timescale Margin Integration theory: subjects maintain a stable semantic interpretation of whether binary marks are adverse or beneficial. Conditional on that interpretation, tally evidence depends only on the signed absolute count margin, never on display density or the number of discriminating cues. A rapidly compressing accumulator supplies strong evidence at the first nonzero margin, while a very small logarithmic tail preserves continued but sharply diminishing growth across moderate and large margins. Count-residualized validity evidence remains continuously available but is softly standardized and subject to a later, steeper capacity curve that slightly reduces average validity influence at 11 features, preserves relatively more influence at 15 features, and strongly attenuates it by 19 and 37 features. Stable subject differences in count strength, compression, validity attention, semantic polarity, precision, and lapses produce persistent behavioral heterogeneity.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1102 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0846 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1005 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0672 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5: loss=0.0812 -> REJECTED
- iter 6: loss=0.0568 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 7: loss=0.0814 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 6 at loss=0.0568 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

**Description**
Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Field Integration theory: people establish a stable interpretation of whether marked ratings are adverse or beneficial, then allocate attention to currently discriminating evidence rather than total displayed feature count. Count and reliability information form a joint diagnostic field. Tally evidence accumulates smoothly with count margin, while reliability attention increases when discriminating cues expose a salient and internally organized reliability contrast. Accessibility is additionally calibrated by the clustering structure of the full communicated validity profile: coherent high-versus-low reliability blocks preserve attention, whereas uniformly graded profiles receive less reliability amplification. Only an unusually large set of simultaneously discriminating cues creates overload; under such overload, count evidence is divisively compressed, especially at larger margins. Opposing count and reliability signals usually inhibit one another through smooth conflict normalization. However, this normalization is locally weaker when the first count advantage appears, because a single additional mark is treated as diagnostic evidence rather than as a reason to globally discount the pre-existing reliability field. Stable subject-level integration style follows a softly polarized continuum between predominantly tally-oriented and predominantly reliability-sensitive policies, producing persistent individual differences without changing semantic polarity across tasks.

`rationale`: This is a one-mechanism edit of the accepted iteration-4 source. All parameter ranges, style allocation, profile-level clustering, reliability attention, and overload computations are unchanged. The only computational change is a smooth, narrow 40% reduction in conflict normalization around count margin one. Iteration 5 showed that increasing margin-one conflict normalization moved Experiment 7 sharply in the wrong direction; this edit applies the empirically indicated opposite adjustment. The notch is effectively absent by margin two, has no effect on count ties because their count signal cannot conflict with reliability, and leaves the dense-field pathways governing Experiments 8–10 unchanged. In Experiment 7, reliability commonly dominates a newly opposing one-mark tally signal; weaker normalization preserves that reliability-directed net evidence rather than pulling it excessively toward indifference, thereby reducing the predicted margin-one-minus-tie contrast. The same change can modestly steepen the ordinary margin trajectory in Experiment 12, while avoiding the rejected changes to overload tails, extreme-density compression, style polarization, or global reliability attention.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family and achieves several important cross-experiment successes: Experiment 2 is correctly below the TTB threshold; Experiments 3, 7, 10, and especially 11 are close to the human point estimates; and Experiment 12 recovers the positive margin trajectory that pi_7 missed. The strong Experiment 11 fit (0.862 versus 0.844) shows that organized reliability structure remains accessible in a 37-feature display, as required. However, the dense-display behavior is not yet experiment-invariant. Experiment 8 has the wrong sign (16 versus -28), indicating insufficient selective attenuation of the margin-five response relative to margin one. Experiment 9 also shows a substantial density effect where humans show essentially none (1.084 versus -0.041). The likely source is that overload begins around 12–17 discriminating cues and the margin activation at margin one remains appreciable: with the stated ranges it is roughly 0.21–0.36, so increasing diagnostic density still compresses margin-one count evidence. This directly contradicts the candidate's claim that margin-one trials receive little compression. There are secondary underfits in Experiments 1 (-0.280 versus -0.436), 4 (-0.393 versus -0.483), 5 (0.183 versus 0.231), and 12 (0.058 versus 0.079), while reliability sensitivity is excessive in Experiment 6 (0.181 versus 0.106). Finally, between-subject variance is much too low in many experiments—especially 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12—so the continuous style parameter is not generating the stable heterogeneity required by the recommendation.
Rationale: Keep the current mechanism family, but recalibrate its diagnostic-overload gate. Raise the diagnostic-span range above the densities reached in Experiment 9 and most of Experiment 10 (for example, toward roughly 18–22 cues), while increasing compression strength after that later threshold. This should spare Experiment 9's margin-one sequence and improve Experiment 10, yet still strongly compress Experiment 8's unusually large diagnostic field. Replace the current linear-fraction margin activation m/(m+s) with a steeper smooth activation such as m^p/(m^p+s^p), with p around 2–3, so compression is negligible at margin one but substantial at margin five; jointly tune the later threshold and stronger compression to move Experiment 8 from positive toward the observed negative contrast without introducing an abrupt discontinuity. Outside overload, modestly strengthen ordinary count accumulation or response gain to address Experiments 1, 4, 10, and 12. Separately, reduce baseline reliability attention for diffuse profiles while preserving or increasing the organization-dependent gain, targeting the Experiment 6 overprediction without sacrificing the organized contrast in Experiment 11. Finally, make the stable style distribution more dispersed or softly bimodal—still within the prescribed tally-oriented/reliability-sensitive mixture—so subject-level variance rises without changing polarity. These are in-family adjustments to gating, normalization, and parameter distributions rather than a change of theory.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1102 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0846 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision materially improves the cross-experiment fit: aggregate loss falls from 0.1102 to 0.0846, Experiment 8 moves to the correct sign (16 to -10), Experiment 9 is brought much closer to its near-zero target, and Experiments 4, 10, 11, and 12 now fit well. It remains faithful to the prescribed Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family, and the strong 37-feature validity effect in Experiment 11 is preserved. Nevertheless, several systematic errors remain. Experiment 1 substantially underestimates tally dominance (-0.244 versus -0.436) and worsened after the latest revision. Experiment 6 still overstates reliability sensitivity (0.186 versus 0.106), also slightly worsening, while Experiment 5 understates reliability sensitivity (0.174 versus 0.231). This combination suggests that the reliability-attention gate is responding too strongly to coherent but smoothly graded validity profiles and not strongly enough to genuinely clustered high-versus-low validity structure. The current organization ratio measures directional coherence but does not distinguish a smooth validity gradient from a salient reliability gap. Dense-display normalization is also not fully calibrated: Experiment 8 remains insufficiently negative (-10 versus -28), whereas Experiment 9 has crossed past its approximately null target to -0.368. Finally, subject-level variance remains much too low in Experiments 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 despite the transformed style parameter, so the claimed stable mixture is still behaviorally too homogeneous.
Rationale: Continue tuning within the current mechanism family. The prior advice was successful overall, so retain the late, margin-selective overload architecture, but make two localized refinements. First, replace or supplement the present contrast-salience ratio with a smooth measure of validity-profile clustering or gap strength among discriminating cues. Organization-dependent attention should be high for separated high/low blocks, as in Experiments 5 and 11, but lower for smooth gradients, as in Experiments 1 and 6. This should reduce excessive reliability influence in Experiments 1 and 6 without sacrificing Experiment 11 and may raise the currently weak Experiment 5 effect. Do not simply increase global count gain or globally reduce reliability gain, because the latest accepted revision shows that those broad changes improve some count tasks while worsening Experiment 1 and leaving the Experiment 5/6 dissociation unresolved. Second, eliminate residual overload below 20 discriminating cues by moving the span slightly higher or narrowing the softplus tail, targeting Experiment 9's null density effect; compensate only above that threshold with somewhat stronger or more rapidly increasing overload compression so Experiment 8 moves from -10 toward -28 while Experiment 10 remains intact. Finally, make the stable style mixture more behaviorally separated at its endpoints—through wider count-versus-reliability allocation differences rather than greater lapse noise—while constraining overload-parameter heterogeneity so variance rises in ordinary integration tasks without further inflating Experiments 8 and 9.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0846 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1005 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains faithful to the Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family, but it is not an improvement over the accepted iteration: aggregate loss rises from 0.0846 to 0.1005, so the gate correctly rejected it. The main failure is an overcorrection in dense displays. Experiment 8 moves from the accepted model's moderately insufficient compression (-10 versus -28) to extreme compression (-118), overshooting the target by 90 points and more than doubling the variance to 52.91. Experiment 9 also moves farther from its near-null target, from -0.368 to -1.001. Thus, the revised late overload gate does not isolate Experiment 8 from lower-density conditions as intended. The replacement of dispersion-based contrast with the largest active-cue gap is also not experiment-invariant. It improves Experiment 6 (0.146 versus 0.106) and preserves Experiment 11 (0.839 versus 0.844), but Experiment 5 worsens to 0.158 versus 0.231, Experiment 7 worsens to 0.103 versus 0.039, and Experiment 1 remains substantially too weak at -0.283 versus -0.436. A largest gap computed only among active cues can make sparse subsets of an otherwise smooth validity gradient appear artificially clustered, while failing to represent the communicated high/low organization consistently. The wider style endpoints likewise do not solve the general variance deficit: variances remain too low in Experiments 1, 3, 5, 6, and 12, while variance is now excessive in Experiments 7 and 8. Experiments 2, 3, 10, and 11 remain good, but these successes were already largely present in the accepted base.
Rationale: Build again from the unchanged accepted iteration-2 base rather than repeating the rejected combination of a wholesale largest-gap replacement, stronger post-threshold compression, and wider allocation endpoints. For overload, take an intermediate step between iterations 2 and 3: retain iteration 2's late margin-selective gate and increase high-density compression only modestly, with an explicit cap or more gradual divisor so Experiment 8 can move from -10 toward -28 rather than to -118. Do not again raise and sharpen the threshold simultaneously; that rejected move also worsened Experiment 9. For reliability attention, use a small profile-level clustering modifier based on the full communicated validity vector, not the largest gap among currently active cues. Blending this modifier with the accepted dispersion/organization signal should distinguish genuinely separated validity blocks in Experiments 5 and 11 from smooth gradients in Experiments 1 and 6 without allowing sparse active subsets to manufacture salience. Keep its gain bounded so that Experiment 7's margin-one contrast does not increase further. Restore the accepted model's endpoint allocation coefficients; widening them was rejected and produced localized excess variance rather than the desired broad heterogeneity. If heterogeneity is tuned further, adjust mixture concentration or mixture weights conservatively while holding endpoint policies near their accepted values. The immediate calibration priorities are Experiment 8 without disturbing Experiment 9, and the Experiment 5-versus-6 reliability dissociation, while preserving the already strong fits in Experiments 3, 10, and 11.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1005 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0672 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iteration 4 is a genuine improvement: the loss falls from 0.0846 to 0.0672, and the candidate remains faithful to Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration. The successful full-profile clustering modifier improves Experiment 1 (-0.308 versus -0.244 previously), Experiment 6 (0.137 versus 0.186), and Experiment 9 (0.154, near the observed -0.041), while Experiment 4 is now essentially exact. It also preserves the important qualitative successes: ordinary margin accumulation in Experiments 2 and 12, strong count effects in Experiment 3, and accessible organized reliability information in the 37-feature Experiment 11. However, the fit is not yet fully experiment-invariant. Experiment 1 still understates tally dominance (-0.308 versus -0.436), and diffuse-profile reliability remains somewhat excessive in Experiment 6 (0.137 versus 0.106). Conversely, Experiment 5 now substantially understates validity-sensitive modulation (0.153 versus 0.231). Experiment 7 overstates the effect of adding a margin-one count cue (0.096 versus 0.039). The revised margin activation also did not deliver its intended dense-display improvement: Experiment 8 moved away from its target (-2 versus -28), while large-margin performance in Experiment 10 deteriorated from 0.872 to 0.838 versus 0.875. Finally, the stable latent style remains too behaviorally homogeneous in Experiments 1, 4, 5, 6, and 12, whose simulated between-subject variances are generally only one-quarter to one-half of the observed values.
Rationale: Build conservatively on this accepted candidate. The most recent advice was successful, so retain the full-communicated-profile modifier, current allocation endpoints, and late diagnostic-overload architecture. Refine the profile-attention mapping rather than replacing it: lower attention somewhat further for genuinely smooth profiles, but use a bounded saturating transformation that returns attention to approximately one for strongly clustered profiles. That should continue moving Experiments 1 and 6 in the observed direction without further suppressing Experiment 5 or disturbing Experiment 11. Do not further increase the margin-activation exponent or broadly strengthen post-threshold compression: the former failed to improve Experiment 8 and hurt Experiment 10, while the previous large compression increase was rejected after producing the -118 overshoot. If Experiment 8 is tuned, use only a small capped adjustment confined to very high diagnostic counts, leaving the ordinary large-margin response in Experiment 10 unchanged. Experiment 7 should be addressed through a modest recalibration of conflict normalization around margin-one evidence, not a global reduction of reliability attention. Finally, increase heterogeneity conservatively through the concentration or mixture weights of the existing stable style distribution while keeping its accepted endpoint policies fixed; widening those endpoints was already rejected. Dense-display expression of this heterogeneity may be damped by the existing normalization so variance rises in Experiments 1, 4, 5, 6, and 12 without again inflating Experiments 7–9.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0672 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.0812 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family, but iteration 5 is a regression: aggregate loss rises from the accepted 0.0672 to 0.0812, so it cannot be retained. Some changes helped locally—Experiment 6 is now essentially exact (0.1045 versus 0.1062), and Experiment 10 improves to 0.865 versus 0.875—but the joint calibration deteriorates. Most notably, the margin-one conflict boost moved Experiment 7 sharply in the wrong direction, from 0.096 to 0.145 against an observed 0.039. Removing the subthreshold overload tail also worsened Experiment 9 from a near-null 0.154 to 0.697, despite the observed value being -0.041. The added extreme-density term overshot Experiment 8 from -2 to -56 rather than approaching -28 conservatively, while inflating variance. Experiment 1 remains substantially too weak (-0.297 versus -0.436), Experiment 5 still underpredicts clustered-profile validity modulation (0.154 versus 0.231), and the previously exact Experiment 4 worsens to -0.450 versus -0.483. The stronger style polarization did not solve the broad variance deficit and instead contributed excessive variance in Experiments 7–9. Thus, the rejected edits do not provide an experiment-invariant improvement over iteration 4.
Rationale: Build from the unchanged accepted iteration-4 base and do not repeat the coupled iteration-5 changes. The previous recommendation to boost conflict normalization around margin one was rejected empirically: it increased rather than decreased Experiment 7. Try the opposite, but narrowly—use a shallow local reduction or notch in conflict normalization around margin one, leaving tie and larger-margin processing unchanged. Restore iteration 4's overload function and remove the separate extreme-density term; the logistic-tail suppression damaged Experiment 9, while the new density correction overshot Experiment 8. If Experiment 8 is revisited later, change only one existing overload parameter by a much smaller amount rather than adding another density pathway. For the Experiment 5-versus-6 dissociation, retain iteration 4's diffuse-profile baseline and modify only the clustered component: modestly increase the interaction of full-profile clustering with organization or contrast, using saturation so the already strong Experiment 11 remains near its current ceiling. This is preferable to again lowering the general profile-attention floor, which produced little gain in Experiment 1, left Experiment 5 unchanged, and worsened the aggregate fit. Also restore iteration 4's style transformation; the latest concentration change failed to deliver the required broad variance increase and exaggerated heterogeneity in dense tasks. Prioritize a one-change-at-a-time fit to Experiments 5 and 7 while preserving iteration 4's strong results in Experiments 3, 4, 9, 10, and 11.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.0812 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.0568 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 6
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iteration 6 is the best candidate so far and remains faithful to the prescribed Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family. The accepted margin-one conflict notch was empirically helpful: aggregate loss fell from 0.0672 to 0.0568, Experiment 7 moved from 0.0962 to 0.0821 toward the observed 0.0392, and Experiment 9 is now essentially exact (-0.0117 versus -0.0407). The candidate also captures the central cross-task pattern: Experiment 2 rejects excessive TTB alignment, Experiment 3 shows strong count-margin responding, Experiment 10 retains attenuated but substantial large-margin responding, and Experiments 9 and 11 avoid a generic density penalty while preserving organized reliability information in a 37-feature display. Experiment 11 is especially accurate (0.8454 versus 0.8442). Nevertheless, the remaining errors are systematic rather than merely Monte Carlo noise. Experiment 1 still substantially underestimates tally dominance (-0.2977 versus -0.4355), Experiment 5 underestimates validity-sensitive modulation (0.1622 versus 0.2306), and Experiment 6 retains somewhat excessive reliability sensitivity (0.1366 versus 0.1062). Experiment 7 remains about twice the observed contrast, while the ordinary margin slope in Experiment 12 is still shallow (0.0645 versus 0.0793). Most importantly, the claimed stable subject heterogeneity is not reproduced broadly: variances remain far too low in Experiments 1, 4, 5, 6, and 12, even though dense-task variance can be adequate or excessive. Thus the model captures the qualitative invariances well but is not yet fully calibrated across ordinary integration tasks.
Rationale: Build conservatively on this accepted candidate. The prior recommendation to reduce conflict normalization narrowly around margin one was successful, so retain the current notch; do not deepen it immediately, because Experiment 7 improved substantially and a larger step could overshoot. Also preserve the current overload and profile-clustering architecture, which jointly produced the excellent Experiments 9 and 11 fits. The most coherent next single adjustment is a small increase in ordinary count accumulation—preferably a narrow upward shift in count_gain or a slight widening of the near-linear portion of count_scale, without changing overload compression. Several deviations point in that same direction: stronger count evidence should make Experiment 1 more negative, move Experiment 4 toward its more negative target, raise the Experiment 3 large-margin effect and Experiment 12 slope, and may move Experiment 8 from -36 toward -28 by restoring some margin-five evidence. It may also further reduce Experiment 7 when the new count cue opposes reliability. Use a small step rather than a broad response-precision increase, which would also amplify the already excessive reliability effect in Experiment 6 and risk disturbing Experiment 11. If that count-only adjustment is successful, address Experiment 5 separately by modestly increasing only the clustering-by-organization contribution to reliability attention, with saturation to protect Experiment 11; do not again lower the general profile-attention floor, since that previous coupled push was rejected. Finally, the broad variance deficit still requires attention, but previous widening of style endpoints was rejected. A later in-family solution should vary stable mixture weights or subject-level count/reliability gain concentration while keeping endpoint policies and dense-display normalization fixed, rather than increasing endpoint separation or lapse noise.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.0568 -> iter 7 candidate loss=0.0814 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 7 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is faithful to the Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family, but it was correctly rejected: loss increased from 0.0568 to 0.0814. The isolated upward shift in count_gain was not experiment-invariant. It modestly improved Experiment 1 (-0.3225 versus -0.2977 previously) and left Experiment 4 close, but it overshot Experiment 3 (0.7667 versus 0.7367), moved Experiment 8 from a good -36 to the wrong-sign value 2 against -28, destroyed the nearly exact Experiment 9 fit (-1.489 versus -0.041), and displaced the excellent Experiment 11 fit (0.8679 versus 0.8442). Experiment 12 improved only trivially, and Experiment 7 did not improve. Thus, the remaining Experiment 1 deficit cannot safely be repaired through a global count-gain increase. The accepted iteration-6 base already captures the central invariances—smooth ordinary margin accumulation, dense-display compression, negligible density effect in Experiment 9, and preserved organized reliability in Experiment 11—but still has a contextual allocation problem: it gives too little reliability modulation to the clustered profile in Experiment 5, somewhat too much to the smooth profile in Experiment 6, and too little tally dominance in Experiment 1. Subject-level variances also remain systematically too small in ordinary tasks, although earlier endpoint widening was unsuccessful.
Rationale: Return to the unchanged accepted iteration-6 base and do not repeat the global count_gain increase; my previous push in that direction was rejected decisively. Preserve the accepted count gain, overload gate, margin-one conflict notch, and dense-display normalization that produced the strong Experiment 8, 9, and 11 combination. Try a different in-family knob: make allocation modestly dependent on full-profile clustering through a bounded, approximately zero-sum rebalancing. Smooth or weakly clustered profiles should shift a small amount of allocation from reliability toward count, targeting the Experiment 1 tally underfit and Experiment 6 reliability overfit; strongly clustered profiles should shift that allocation toward reliability, targeting Experiment 5. Apply the clustered boost through the existing clustering-by-organization interaction and cap or saturate it so Experiment 11, already near ceiling, is not amplified. This should be a single conservative modification rather than another coupled overload or response-precision change. Monitor Experiment 7 because its clustered conflict display could be affected; retain the successful margin-one notch and keep the new reallocation small enough not to increase its already excessive contrast. Defer variance tuning until this point-estimate dissociation is improved. When revisiting heterogeneity, alter stable mixture weights or concentration around the existing endpoint policies—not endpoint separation, global gain, or lapse rate, all of which have either failed or risk disrupting dense-task fits.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 7 candidate loss=0.0814 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Field Integration theory: people establish a stable interpretation of whether marked ratings are adverse or beneficial, then allocate attention to currently discriminating evidence rather than total displayed feature count. Count and reliability information form a joint diagnostic field. Tally evidence accumulates smoothly with count margin, while reliability attention increases when discriminating cues expose a salient and internally organized reliability contrast. Accessibility is additionally calibrated by the clustering structure of the full communicated validity profile: coherent high-versus-low reliability blocks preserve attention, whereas uniformly graded profiles receive less reliability amplification. A small bounded reallocation further shifts resources from reliability toward tallying for smooth profiles and toward reliability for strongly clustered profiles. The clustered-profile shift is expressed primarily when the diagnostic set is compact, preventing already decisive organized fields from receiving an additional boost. Only an unusually large set of simultaneously discriminating cues creates overload; under such overload, count evidence is divisively compressed, especially at larger margins. Opposing count and reliability signals usually inhibit one another through smooth conflict normalization. However, this normalization is locally weaker when the first count advantage appears, because a single additional mark is treated as diagnostic evidence rather than as a reason to globally discount the pre-existing reliability field. Stable subject-level integration style follows a softly polarized continuum between predominantly tally-oriented and predominantly reliability-sensitive policies, producing persistent individual differences without changing semantic polarity across tasks.",

Strongly clustered profiles shift allocation in the opposite direction, targeting Experiment 5.
