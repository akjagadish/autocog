# feedback_iter_08

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_7`).

Replace pi_7 with a Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration theory that is a stronger competitor to pi_4. Retain stable semantic-polarity inference, but reject both a fixed feature-count capacity curve and universally smooth, context-free integration. The new theory should propose that attention is allocated according to diagnostic structure—reliability contrast, organization/salience, redundancy, conflict, and the number or fraction of discriminating cues—rather than total displayed feature count alone. Consequently, a structured high-versus-low validity contrast can remain strongly available even in a 37-feature display, as required by Experiment 1. Count evidence should accumulate smoothly across ordinary margins, as required by Experiment 2, but undergo divisive normalization or context-dependent compression in dense, extreme, or highly redundant displays, allowing the attenuated margin contrast in Experiment 10 without imposing pi_7's abrupt margin-one saturation. Validity and count evidence should be represented jointly so that adding a count cue can change normalization and conflict, but the theory should not impose the large discontinuity rejected by Experiment 9 or a systematic density effect rejected by Experiment 11. Include stable subject-level latent differences—or a stable mixture between predominantly tally-oriented and reliability-sensitive integration policies—to reproduce the elevated observed variances while preserving polarity across experiments. The replacement must make falsifiable cross-task predictions from common parameters and should be calibrated simultaneously to all experiments, not by separate feature-count-specific knees.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Field Integration theory: people establish a stable interpretation of whether marked ratings are adverse or beneficial, then allocate attention to currently discriminating evidence rather than total displayed feature count. Count and reliability information form a joint diagnostic field. Tally evidence accumulates smoothly with count margin, while reliability attention increases when discriminating cues expose a salient and internally organized reliability contrast. Accessibility is additionally calibrated by the clustering structure of the full communicated validity profile: coherent high-versus-low reliability blocks preserve attention, whereas uniformly graded profiles receive less reliability amplification. Only an unusually large set of simultaneously discriminating cues creates overload; under such overload, count evidence is divisively compressed, especially at larger margins. Opposing count and reliability signals usually inhibit one another through smooth conflict normalization. However, this normalization is locally weaker when the first count advantage appears, because a single additional mark is treated as diagnostic evidence rather than as a reason to globally discount the pre-existing reliability field. Stable subject-level integration style follows a softly polarized continuum between predominantly tally-oriented and predominantly reliability-sensitive policies, producing persistent individual differences without changing semantic polarity across tasks.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal two-constant refinement of the accepted iteration-6 model. All allocations, parameter ranges, profile-clustering computations, reliability attention, count accumulation, and overload pathways are unchanged. The Gaussian conflict notch is narrowed from 0.55 to 0.50 and its depth is increased modestly from 0.40 to 0.45. The earlier introduction of this notch was accepted and moved Experiment 7 toward the human value, whereas global count-gain and profile-dependent resource reallocations were rejected because they disrupted Experiments 8, 9, and 11. The present change continues only that empirically successful direction. At exact margin one it slightly preserves whichever jointly integrated signal already dominates; by margin two its effect is smaller than before, and it has no effect on count ties because count–reliability conflict is then absent. Consequently, it targets the residual Experiment 7 contrast while minimizing changes to ordinary margin accumulation and to the dense-field mechanisms responsible for the accepted fits in Experiments 8–11.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1102 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0846 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1005 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.0672 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5: loss=0.0812 -> REJECTED
- iter 6: loss=0.0568 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 7: loss=0.0814 -> REJECTED
- iter 8: loss=0.0878 -> REJECTED
- iter 9 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0724 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 6 at loss=0.0568.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family and achieves several important cross-experiment successes: Experiment 2 is correctly below the TTB threshold; Experiments 3, 7, 10, and especially 11 are close to the human point estimates; and Experiment 12 recovers the positive margin trajectory that pi_7 missed. The strong Experiment 11 fit (0.862 versus 0.844) shows that organized reliability structure remains accessible in a 37-feature display, as required. However, the dense-display behavior is not yet experiment-invariant. Experiment 8 has the wrong sign (16 versus -28), indicating insufficient selective attenuation of the margin-five response relative to margin one. Experiment 9 also shows a substantial density effect where humans show essentially none (1.084 versus -0.041). The likely source is that overload begins around 12–17 discriminating cues and the margin activation at margin one remains appreciable: with the stated ranges it is roughly 0.21–0.36, so increasing diagnostic density still compresses margin-one count evidence. This directly contradicts the candidate's claim that margin-one trials receive little compression. There are secondary underfits in Experiments 1 (-0.280 versus -0.436), 4 (-0.393 versus -0.483), 5 (0.183 versus 0.231), and 12 (0.058 versus 0.079), while reliability sensitivity is excessive in Experiment 6 (0.181 versus 0.106). Finally, between-subject variance is much too low in many experiments—especially 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12—so the continuous style parameter is not generating the stable heterogeneity required by the recommendation.
Rationale: Keep the current mechanism family, but recalibrate its diagnostic-overload gate. Raise the diagnostic-span range above the densities reached in Experiment 9 and most of Experiment 10 (for example, toward roughly 18–22 cues), while increasing compression strength after that later threshold. This should spare Experiment 9's margin-one sequence and improve Experiment 10, yet still strongly compress Experiment 8's unusually large diagnostic field. Replace the current linear-fraction margin activation m/(m+s) with a steeper smooth activation such as m^p/(m^p+s^p), with p around 2–3, so compression is negligible at margin one but substantial at margin five; jointly tune the later threshold and stronger compression to move Experiment 8 from positive toward the observed negative contrast without introducing an abrupt discontinuity. Outside overload, modestly strengthen ordinary count accumulation or response gain to address Experiments 1, 4, 10, and 12. Separately, reduce baseline reliability attention for diffuse profiles while preserving or increasing the organization-dependent gain, targeting the Experiment 6 overprediction without sacrificing the organized contrast in Experiment 11. Finally, make the stable style distribution more dispersed or softly bimodal—still within the prescribed tally-oriented/reliability-sensitive mixture—so subject-level variance rises without changing polarity. These are in-family adjustments to gating, normalization, and parameter distributions rather than a change of theory.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1102 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0846 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision materially improves the cross-experiment fit: aggregate loss falls from 0.1102 to 0.0846, Experiment 8 moves to the correct sign (16 to -10), Experiment 9 is brought much closer to its near-zero target, and Experiments 4, 10, 11, and 12 now fit well. It remains faithful to the prescribed Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family, and the strong 37-feature validity effect in Experiment 11 is preserved. Nevertheless, several systematic errors remain. Experiment 1 substantially underestimates tally dominance (-0.244 versus -0.436) and worsened after the latest revision. Experiment 6 still overstates reliability sensitivity (0.186 versus 0.106), also slightly worsening, while Experiment 5 understates reliability sensitivity (0.174 versus 0.231). This combination suggests that the reliability-attention gate is responding too strongly to coherent but smoothly graded validity profiles and not strongly enough to genuinely clustered high-versus-low validity structure. The current organization ratio measures directional coherence but does not distinguish a smooth validity gradient from a salient reliability gap. Dense-display normalization is also not fully calibrated: Experiment 8 remains insufficiently negative (-10 versus -28), whereas Experiment 9 has crossed past its approximately null target to -0.368. Finally, subject-level variance remains much too low in Experiments 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 despite the transformed style parameter, so the claimed stable mixture is still behaviorally too homogeneous.
Rationale: Continue tuning within the current mechanism family. The prior advice was successful overall, so retain the late, margin-selective overload architecture, but make two localized refinements. First, replace or supplement the present contrast-salience ratio with a smooth measure of validity-profile clustering or gap strength among discriminating cues. Organization-dependent attention should be high for separated high/low blocks, as in Experiments 5 and 11, but lower for smooth gradients, as in Experiments 1 and 6. This should reduce excessive reliability influence in Experiments 1 and 6 without sacrificing Experiment 11 and may raise the currently weak Experiment 5 effect. Do not simply increase global count gain or globally reduce reliability gain, because the latest accepted revision shows that those broad changes improve some count tasks while worsening Experiment 1 and leaving the Experiment 5/6 dissociation unresolved. Second, eliminate residual overload below 20 discriminating cues by moving the span slightly higher or narrowing the softplus tail, targeting Experiment 9's null density effect; compensate only above that threshold with somewhat stronger or more rapidly increasing overload compression so Experiment 8 moves from -10 toward -28 while Experiment 10 remains intact. Finally, make the stable style mixture more behaviorally separated at its endpoints—through wider count-versus-reliability allocation differences rather than greater lapse noise—while constraining overload-parameter heterogeneity so variance rises in ordinary integration tasks without further inflating Experiments 8 and 9.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0846 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1005 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains faithful to the Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family, but it is not an improvement over the accepted iteration: aggregate loss rises from 0.0846 to 0.1005, so the gate correctly rejected it. The main failure is an overcorrection in dense displays. Experiment 8 moves from the accepted model's moderately insufficient compression (-10 versus -28) to extreme compression (-118), overshooting the target by 90 points and more than doubling the variance to 52.91. Experiment 9 also moves farther from its near-null target, from -0.368 to -1.001. Thus, the revised late overload gate does not isolate Experiment 8 from lower-density conditions as intended. The replacement of dispersion-based contrast with the largest active-cue gap is also not experiment-invariant. It improves Experiment 6 (0.146 versus 0.106) and preserves Experiment 11 (0.839 versus 0.844), but Experiment 5 worsens to 0.158 versus 0.231, Experiment 7 worsens to 0.103 versus 0.039, and Experiment 1 remains substantially too weak at -0.283 versus -0.436. A largest gap computed only among active cues can make sparse subsets of an otherwise smooth validity gradient appear artificially clustered, while failing to represent the communicated high/low organization consistently. The wider style endpoints likewise do not solve the general variance deficit: variances remain too low in Experiments 1, 3, 5, 6, and 12, while variance is now excessive in Experiments 7 and 8. Experiments 2, 3, 10, and 11 remain good, but these successes were already largely present in the accepted base.
Rationale: Build again from the unchanged accepted iteration-2 base rather than repeating the rejected combination of a wholesale largest-gap replacement, stronger post-threshold compression, and wider allocation endpoints. For overload, take an intermediate step between iterations 2 and 3: retain iteration 2's late margin-selective gate and increase high-density compression only modestly, with an explicit cap or more gradual divisor so Experiment 8 can move from -10 toward -28 rather than to -118. Do not again raise and sharpen the threshold simultaneously; that rejected move also worsened Experiment 9. For reliability attention, use a small profile-level clustering modifier based on the full communicated validity vector, not the largest gap among currently active cues. Blending this modifier with the accepted dispersion/organization signal should distinguish genuinely separated validity blocks in Experiments 5 and 11 from smooth gradients in Experiments 1 and 6 without allowing sparse active subsets to manufacture salience. Keep its gain bounded so that Experiment 7's margin-one contrast does not increase further. Restore the accepted model's endpoint allocation coefficients; widening them was rejected and produced localized excess variance rather than the desired broad heterogeneity. If heterogeneity is tuned further, adjust mixture concentration or mixture weights conservatively while holding endpoint policies near their accepted values. The immediate calibration priorities are Experiment 8 without disturbing Experiment 9, and the Experiment 5-versus-6 reliability dissociation, while preserving the already strong fits in Experiments 3, 10, and 11.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1005 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.0672 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iteration 4 is a genuine improvement: the loss falls from 0.0846 to 0.0672, and the candidate remains faithful to Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration. The successful full-profile clustering modifier improves Experiment 1 (-0.308 versus -0.244 previously), Experiment 6 (0.137 versus 0.186), and Experiment 9 (0.154, near the observed -0.041), while Experiment 4 is now essentially exact. It also preserves the important qualitative successes: ordinary margin accumulation in Experiments 2 and 12, strong count effects in Experiment 3, and accessible organized reliability information in the 37-feature Experiment 11. However, the fit is not yet fully experiment-invariant. Experiment 1 still understates tally dominance (-0.308 versus -0.436), and diffuse-profile reliability remains somewhat excessive in Experiment 6 (0.137 versus 0.106). Conversely, Experiment 5 now substantially understates validity-sensitive modulation (0.153 versus 0.231). Experiment 7 overstates the effect of adding a margin-one count cue (0.096 versus 0.039). The revised margin activation also did not deliver its intended dense-display improvement: Experiment 8 moved away from its target (-2 versus -28), while large-margin performance in Experiment 10 deteriorated from 0.872 to 0.838 versus 0.875. Finally, the stable latent style remains too behaviorally homogeneous in Experiments 1, 4, 5, 6, and 12, whose simulated between-subject variances are generally only one-quarter to one-half of the observed values.
Rationale: Build conservatively on this accepted candidate. The most recent advice was successful, so retain the full-communicated-profile modifier, current allocation endpoints, and late diagnostic-overload architecture. Refine the profile-attention mapping rather than replacing it: lower attention somewhat further for genuinely smooth profiles, but use a bounded saturating transformation that returns attention to approximately one for strongly clustered profiles. That should continue moving Experiments 1 and 6 in the observed direction without further suppressing Experiment 5 or disturbing Experiment 11. Do not further increase the margin-activation exponent or broadly strengthen post-threshold compression: the former failed to improve Experiment 8 and hurt Experiment 10, while the previous large compression increase was rejected after producing the -118 overshoot. If Experiment 8 is tuned, use only a small capped adjustment confined to very high diagnostic counts, leaving the ordinary large-margin response in Experiment 10 unchanged. Experiment 7 should be addressed through a modest recalibration of conflict normalization around margin-one evidence, not a global reduction of reliability attention. Finally, increase heterogeneity conservatively through the concentration or mixture weights of the existing stable style distribution while keeping its accepted endpoint policies fixed; widening those endpoints was already rejected. Dense-display expression of this heterogeneity may be damped by the existing normalization so variance rises in Experiments 1, 4, 5, 6, and 12 without again inflating Experiments 7–9.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.0672 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.0812 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family, but iteration 5 is a regression: aggregate loss rises from the accepted 0.0672 to 0.0812, so it cannot be retained. Some changes helped locally—Experiment 6 is now essentially exact (0.1045 versus 0.1062), and Experiment 10 improves to 0.865 versus 0.875—but the joint calibration deteriorates. Most notably, the margin-one conflict boost moved Experiment 7 sharply in the wrong direction, from 0.096 to 0.145 against an observed 0.039. Removing the subthreshold overload tail also worsened Experiment 9 from a near-null 0.154 to 0.697, despite the observed value being -0.041. The added extreme-density term overshot Experiment 8 from -2 to -56 rather than approaching -28 conservatively, while inflating variance. Experiment 1 remains substantially too weak (-0.297 versus -0.436), Experiment 5 still underpredicts clustered-profile validity modulation (0.154 versus 0.231), and the previously exact Experiment 4 worsens to -0.450 versus -0.483. The stronger style polarization did not solve the broad variance deficit and instead contributed excessive variance in Experiments 7–9. Thus, the rejected edits do not provide an experiment-invariant improvement over iteration 4.
Rationale: Build from the unchanged accepted iteration-4 base and do not repeat the coupled iteration-5 changes. The previous recommendation to boost conflict normalization around margin one was rejected empirically: it increased rather than decreased Experiment 7. Try the opposite, but narrowly—use a shallow local reduction or notch in conflict normalization around margin one, leaving tie and larger-margin processing unchanged. Restore iteration 4's overload function and remove the separate extreme-density term; the logistic-tail suppression damaged Experiment 9, while the new density correction overshot Experiment 8. If Experiment 8 is revisited later, change only one existing overload parameter by a much smaller amount rather than adding another density pathway. For the Experiment 5-versus-6 dissociation, retain iteration 4's diffuse-profile baseline and modify only the clustered component: modestly increase the interaction of full-profile clustering with organization or contrast, using saturation so the already strong Experiment 11 remains near its current ceiling. This is preferable to again lowering the general profile-attention floor, which produced little gain in Experiment 1, left Experiment 5 unchanged, and worsened the aggregate fit. Also restore iteration 4's style transformation; the latest concentration change failed to deliver the required broad variance increase and exaggerated heterogeneity in dense tasks. Prioritize a one-change-at-a-time fit to Experiments 5 and 7 while preserving iteration 4's strong results in Experiments 3, 4, 9, 10, and 11.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.0812 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.0568 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 6
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iteration 6 is the best candidate so far and remains faithful to the prescribed Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family. The accepted margin-one conflict notch was empirically helpful: aggregate loss fell from 0.0672 to 0.0568, Experiment 7 moved from 0.0962 to 0.0821 toward the observed 0.0392, and Experiment 9 is now essentially exact (-0.0117 versus -0.0407). The candidate also captures the central cross-task pattern: Experiment 2 rejects excessive TTB alignment, Experiment 3 shows strong count-margin responding, Experiment 10 retains attenuated but substantial large-margin responding, and Experiments 9 and 11 avoid a generic density penalty while preserving organized reliability information in a 37-feature display. Experiment 11 is especially accurate (0.8454 versus 0.8442). Nevertheless, the remaining errors are systematic rather than merely Monte Carlo noise. Experiment 1 still substantially underestimates tally dominance (-0.2977 versus -0.4355), Experiment 5 underestimates validity-sensitive modulation (0.1622 versus 0.2306), and Experiment 6 retains somewhat excessive reliability sensitivity (0.1366 versus 0.1062). Experiment 7 remains about twice the observed contrast, while the ordinary margin slope in Experiment 12 is still shallow (0.0645 versus 0.0793). Most importantly, the claimed stable subject heterogeneity is not reproduced broadly: variances remain far too low in Experiments 1, 4, 5, 6, and 12, even though dense-task variance can be adequate or excessive. Thus the model captures the qualitative invariances well but is not yet fully calibrated across ordinary integration tasks.
Rationale: Build conservatively on this accepted candidate. The prior recommendation to reduce conflict normalization narrowly around margin one was successful, so retain the current notch; do not deepen it immediately, because Experiment 7 improved substantially and a larger step could overshoot. Also preserve the current overload and profile-clustering architecture, which jointly produced the excellent Experiments 9 and 11 fits. The most coherent next single adjustment is a small increase in ordinary count accumulation—preferably a narrow upward shift in count_gain or a slight widening of the near-linear portion of count_scale, without changing overload compression. Several deviations point in that same direction: stronger count evidence should make Experiment 1 more negative, move Experiment 4 toward its more negative target, raise the Experiment 3 large-margin effect and Experiment 12 slope, and may move Experiment 8 from -36 toward -28 by restoring some margin-five evidence. It may also further reduce Experiment 7 when the new count cue opposes reliability. Use a small step rather than a broad response-precision increase, which would also amplify the already excessive reliability effect in Experiment 6 and risk disturbing Experiment 11. If that count-only adjustment is successful, address Experiment 5 separately by modestly increasing only the clustering-by-organization contribution to reliability attention, with saturation to protect Experiment 11; do not again lower the general profile-attention floor, since that previous coupled push was rejected. Finally, the broad variance deficit still requires attention, but previous widening of style endpoints was rejected. A later in-family solution should vary stable mixture weights or subject-level count/reliability gain concentration while keeping endpoint policies and dense-display normalization fixed, rather than increasing endpoint separation or lapse noise.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.0568 -> iter 7 candidate loss=0.0814 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 7
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate is faithful to the Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family, but it was correctly rejected: loss increased from 0.0568 to 0.0814. The isolated upward shift in count_gain was not experiment-invariant. It modestly improved Experiment 1 (-0.3225 versus -0.2977 previously) and left Experiment 4 close, but it overshot Experiment 3 (0.7667 versus 0.7367), moved Experiment 8 from a good -36 to the wrong-sign value 2 against -28, destroyed the nearly exact Experiment 9 fit (-1.489 versus -0.041), and displaced the excellent Experiment 11 fit (0.8679 versus 0.8442). Experiment 12 improved only trivially, and Experiment 7 did not improve. Thus, the remaining Experiment 1 deficit cannot safely be repaired through a global count-gain increase. The accepted iteration-6 base already captures the central invariances—smooth ordinary margin accumulation, dense-display compression, negligible density effect in Experiment 9, and preserved organized reliability in Experiment 11—but still has a contextual allocation problem: it gives too little reliability modulation to the clustered profile in Experiment 5, somewhat too much to the smooth profile in Experiment 6, and too little tally dominance in Experiment 1. Subject-level variances also remain systematically too small in ordinary tasks, although earlier endpoint widening was unsuccessful.
Rationale: Return to the unchanged accepted iteration-6 base and do not repeat the global count_gain increase; my previous push in that direction was rejected decisively. Preserve the accepted count gain, overload gate, margin-one conflict notch, and dense-display normalization that produced the strong Experiment 8, 9, and 11 combination. Try a different in-family knob: make allocation modestly dependent on full-profile clustering through a bounded, approximately zero-sum rebalancing. Smooth or weakly clustered profiles should shift a small amount of allocation from reliability toward count, targeting the Experiment 1 tally underfit and Experiment 6 reliability overfit; strongly clustered profiles should shift that allocation toward reliability, targeting Experiment 5. Apply the clustered boost through the existing clustering-by-organization interaction and cap or saturate it so Experiment 11, already near ceiling, is not amplified. This should be a single conservative modification rather than another coupled overload or response-precision change. Monitor Experiment 7 because its clustered conflict display could be affected; retain the successful margin-one notch and keep the new reallocation small enough not to increase its already excessive contrast. Defer variance tuning until this point-estimate dissociation is improved. When revisiting heterogeneity, alter stable mixture weights or concentration around the existing endpoint policies—not endpoint separation, global gain, or lapse rate, all of which have either failed or risk disrupting dense-task fits.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 7 candidate loss=0.0814 -> iter 8 candidate loss=0.0878 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 8 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed Resource-Adaptive Diagnostic Integration family, but it is decisively worse than the accepted iteration-6 model: aggregate loss rises from 0.0568 to 0.0878. The new profile-dependent zero-sum reallocation was therefore not experiment-invariant. It provides only modest local movement in the intended tasks—Experiment 5 improves from 0.1622 to 0.1793 but remains below 0.2306, while Experiment 1 remains substantially too weak at -0.3127 versus -0.4355 and Experiment 6 remains too high at 0.1294 versus 0.1062. In exchange, it destroys the accepted dense-display balance. Experiment 8 changes from -36, close to the observed -28, to the wrong-sign value 16. Experiment 9 changes from an almost exact -0.0117 versus -0.0407 to -1.8076, introducing a very large density trajectory that humans do not show. Experiment 7 also worsens from 0.0821 to 0.1100 versus 0.0392, and Experiment 11 drifts away from its previously near-exact fit. Experiments 2, 10, and 12 remain good, but these successes were already present in iteration 6. The likely problem is that transferring resources between count and reliability changes their relative balance before nonlinear conflict normalization; even a profile-constant allocation shift can therefore generate large trial-density effects when count and reliability vary differently across conditions. Variance remains too low in ordinary tasks such as Experiments 1, 4, 5, 6, and 12, while Experiment 9 variance is now excessive, so the added reallocation does not solve the heterogeneity problem either.
Rationale: Build from the unchanged accepted iteration-6 base and remove cluster_reallocation rather than weakening it incrementally. My previous recommendation for approximately zero-sum profile-dependent allocation was rejected by the gate and should not be repeated. Preserve iteration 6's count gain, overload gate, margin-selective compression, profile-clustering computation, and margin-one conflict notch; that combination produced the crucial joint fit in Experiments 8, 9, and 11. For the next adjustment, use a much more localized in-family refinement of the already successful conflict notch: slightly deepen it only very near an exact margin of one, or narrow its width while modestly increasing its depth. The earlier introduction of this notch was accepted and moved Experiment 7 in the correct direction, whereas the current reallocation moved it back. Keep the step small and explicitly check that Experiment 8 remains near -28 and Experiment 9 remains near zero. If the Experiment 5-versus-6 dissociation is addressed in the same candidate, do not move count resources. Instead, make only a small bounded multiplicative calibration of reliability attention using the existing full-profile clustering score: mildly attenuate reliability for smooth profiles and mildly enhance it for strongly clustered profiles, with signal-level saturation so the dense, already decisive Experiment 11 cannot be amplified. This should be implemented by tuning the existing profile-attention mapping, not by adding another allocation or density gate. Given that earlier coupled changes to this mapping were rejected, change it conservatively and preferably separately from the notch calibration. Defer heterogeneity tuning until the accepted Experiment 8/9/11 pattern is preserved; later variance work should alter stable mixture concentration or weights without changing endpoint policies, count gain, or lapse rate.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 8 candidate loss=0.0878 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0724 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.
