# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with a new Capacity-Normalized Bounded Integration theory rather than revising its discrepancy-audit implementation. The new theory should claim that subjects continuously combine a fast count accumulator with validity-sensitive evidence, but that both signals are encoded relative to the size and complexity of the displayed cue set. Count evidence should saturate smoothly, preserving the strong extreme-margin behavior observed in Experiment 5 while producing a smaller margin-one-to-margin-five contrast in Experiment 2. Validity evidence should undergo divisive normalization or reliability compression that strengthens with feature count, total discriminating cues, and cue conflict; it should not receive discontinuous bonuses at exact ties or selected margins. This would preserve the positive direction in Experiment 1, reduce pi_4's excessive magnitude in Experiments 1 and 8, and attenuate its extreme Experiment 2 prediction without reinstating pi_5's falsified audit reversal. Stable subject-level parameters should govern semantic polarity, relative count-versus-validity allocation, compression/capacity, precision, and lapse rate. Parameterization should allow greater heterogeneity in compact tasks, as suggested by Experiments 3 and 5–8, while avoiding the excessive heterogeneity predicted for the 37-feature task. This replacement would be a principled competitor to pi_4: both posit continuous integration, but the new theory predicts scale- and conflict-dependent compression rather than globally additive accumulation.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Capacity-Calibrated Dual-Channel Integration theory: people continuously integrate a rapid representation of the relative number of marked ratings with a validity-sensitive representation of where those marks occur. Neither representation is encoded in raw additive units. The count channel expresses the tally margin relative to the proportion of displayed cues that discriminate and then passes it through a smooth saturating response, so large margins remain decisive without producing indefinitely increasing evidence. The validity channel represents count-residualized reliability evidence in standardized units and divisively normalizes it according to display size, a nonlinear capacity ratio for the number of discriminating cues, cue conflict, and disagreement between count and validity. Thus validity remains available on every trial, including count ties, but there are no special tie, audit, or selected-margin rules. A stable allocation parameter controls the balance between channels. A Hill-shaped capacity function contracts the behavioral expression of individual differences as displays become large, yielding appreciable heterogeneity in compact tasks but more homogeneous behavior in very high-dimensional tasks. Stable semantic-polarity confidence determines whether marked states are interpreted as adverse or beneficial, while stable response precision and lapse rate govern stochasticity.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal recalibration of the accepted dual-channel model. The bounded discrimination-load term is replaced by a smooth power ratio, so validity is preserved or slightly strengthened when few cues discriminate but is much more strongly compressed when the discriminating set approaches or exceeds capacity. This targets the excessive Experiment 6 slope and limits validity-driven contrasts in Experiment 8 without globally lowering validity sensitivity needed in Experiments 1 and 5. Conflict now also includes continuous count-validity disagreement; this selectively attenuates validity evidence that opposes the adverse count signal and should strengthen the negative count alignment in Experiment 4 without introducing gates or margin-specific rules. The count equation itself is unchanged to protect the nearly exact Experiment 3 result. Finally, Hill-shaped feature-load contraction replaces the shallow capacity ratio and also contracts expressed polarity variation, reducing the excessive mean contrast and between-subject variance in the 37-feature task while retaining parameter heterogeneity in compact displays.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1604 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1866 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1604.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed capacity-normalized continuous-integration family and successfully captures several important qualitative constraints. Experiment 2 is classified correctly, Experiment 3's extreme-margin effect is essentially exact (0.738 versus 0.737), and Experiment 7 is close in both direction and magnitude (0.058 versus 0.039), showing that the removal of discontinuous audit/tie rules was beneficial. Nevertheless, the fit is not yet experiment-invariant. The largest failure is Experiment 6, where validity-sensitive variation is almost three times too strong (0.310 versus 0.106). At the same time, validity sensitivity is too weak in Experiment 5 (0.159 versus 0.231), so a global reduction of validity_sensitivity would be inappropriate. Count-driven adverse-markedness is also too weak in Experiment 4 (-0.228 versus -0.483), and Experiment 1 remains insufficiently negative (-0.277 versus -0.436). In the 37-feature Experiment 8, the margin contrast is still substantially too negative (-62 versus -28), with excessive between-subject variance (32.46 versus 21.15). Thus the current normalization does not discriminate sharply enough between sparse/moderate displays and highly discriminating, conflict-heavy displays.
Rationale: Keep the current dual-channel, smooth capacity-normalization architecture, but recalibrate its load and conflict functions rather than changing mechanism families. The primary adjustment should be to make discrimination-load compression more strongly nonlinear while remaining continuous: heavily compress validity evidence when nearly all cues discriminate, as in Experiment 6 and the 37-feature Experiment 8, while preserving or slightly increasing validity sensitivity on sparse and moderately discriminating trials, which is needed for Experiments 1 and 5. The present bounded term n_discriminating/(n_discriminating+capacity) appears too shallow; a smooth power/Hill or ratio-based normalization would separate these regimes better. In addition, define cue conflict continuously to include disagreement between the count and residual-validity channels, not merely an even tally split. Suppressing opposing validity evidence under strong channel disagreement should let the adverse count channel produce the stronger negative alignment required in Experiment 4 without adding special margins or tie bonuses. Recalibrate count saturation only modestly so that Experiment 3's excellent extreme-margin fit is retained while Experiment 8's margin-one versus margin-five contrast moves toward -28. Finally, use a steeper smooth capacity contraction, such as a Hill-shaped function of feature count, to reduce heterogeneity further at 37 features while retaining more parameter expression in compact tasks. The candidate was accepted and is a promising base, but the systematic Experiment 4, 6, and 8 errors are too large to stop tuning.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1604 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1866 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed capacity-normalized continuous-integration family, but this particular recalibration is worse overall and was correctly rejected by the gate. It improves Experiment 1 (-0.389 versus -0.436), Experiment 4 (-0.344 versus -0.483), and Experiment 6 (0.215 versus 0.106), while retaining the correct Experiment 2 classification. Those gains are outweighed by major regressions. Experiment 8 reverses from a moderately excessive negative contrast in the accepted base (-62 versus -28) to an extreme positive contrast (114), and its between-subject variance explodes from 32.46 to 90.88 rather than approaching the observed 21.15. Experiment 5 loses most of the required validity-sensitive slope (0.073 versus 0.231), Experiment 7 rises from near-exact (0.058 versus 0.039) to 0.171, and Experiment 3 moves away from its previously nearly exact extreme-margin fit. The unbounded power load, disagreement compression, and steep feature-count contraction therefore interact too aggressively: they suppress validity almost completely in highly discriminating displays and alter the relative behavior of margin-one and margin-five trials instead of merely compressing its magnitude.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "The previous advice to combine a strong power-ratio load, channel-disagreement compression, and steeper Hill contraction was rejected by the gate, so do not repeat that package. Build on the unchanged iteration-1 accepted base and make a smaller, isolated in-family adjustment. Replace the unbounded term (n_discriminating/capacity)^power with a bounded smooth Hill load, such as x^p/(1+x^p), using a moderate exponent or transition width. This can selectively reduce the excessive Experiment 6 slope without annihilating the validity signal needed in Experiment 5 or flipping Experiment 8. Keep the accepted base's count equation and feature-count expression functions fixed initially, since they produced the nearly exact Experiment 3 and Experiment 7 results and much lower Experiment 8 variance. If count-validity disagreement is retained, introduce it only weakly or blend it with the base conflict term; the current strength helped Experiments 1 and 4 but contributed to excessive condition-specific distortions. Tune one normalization component at a time, targeting an intermediate amount of high-discrimination compression between iterations 1 and 2. The immediate priorities are to preserve Experiment 5 near 0.16 or improve it, keep Experiment 7 near 0.04, and move Experiment 8 modestly from -62 toward -28 without crossing zero; only then pursue the remaining Experiment 4 and 6 discrepancies through small allocation or compression-range changes."
