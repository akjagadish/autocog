# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** This 15-feature design tests the advocated theory's discrepancy-evoked validity audit while making its tie-escalation bonus negligible because tie capacity is exp(-(15-7)) = exp(-8). Each of eight matched sets contains an equal-count trial and a margin-one trial. In every equal-count trial, A's marks are concentrated on low-validity experts and B's marks on high-validity experts, producing a strongly negative count-residualized validity signal. The corresponding margin-one trial differs only by changing the mean-validity expert (validity 0.75, exactly equal to the mean of all validities) from a 0 to a 1 for A. This adds one A mark while leaving residual validity exactly unchanged. Smooth Integration therefore necessarily predicts that this manipulation increases markedness evidence for A, by count_weight + validity_weight*0.75*(1-partial_centering), and hence increases choices of B under the predominant adverse interpretation. The advocated theory predicts the opposite direction: the one-mark discrepancy activates an audit gain of at least 0.9 on the unchanged negative residual. Across the eight sets, residual validity ranges from -2.58 to -3.08. Even in the weakest case, the largest possible added count signal is about 2.20, whereas the smallest audit penalty is 0.9*2.58 = 2.32; the negligible 15-cue tie bonus cannot offset this. Thus the advocated theory necessarily predicts lower B choice probability on the margin-one trial than on its matched tie trial, whereas the competing theory necessarily predicts higher B choice probability. Seven leave-one-pair-out variants provide a quantitative residual-strength gradient in addition to the full configuration. All 16 base trials are also A/B reversed, yielding 32 unique pairs repeated three times for exactly 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 32 unique pairs × 3 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Discrepancy-Evoked Residual Audit with Capacity-Limited Tie Escalation: people first form an adverse-markedness preference from a nonlinear count difference, while count-residualized validity information remains continuously available. Count discrepancies evoke an additional validity audit, but exact count ties trigger a distinct escalation because tallying provides no provisional winner. This tie escalation is strongest when the cue set fits within a fixed attentional capacity and rapidly dilutes as the number of cues exceeds that capacity. Stable subject differences in tie escalation complement existing differences in count reliance, discrepancy auditing, semantic polarity, precision, and lapses.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Semantic-Polarity Smooth Integration theory: people first interpret what the marked binary state means rather than assuming that 1 is intrinsically desirable. Each subject forms a stable posterior belief that a mark is adverse or suspicious. Conditional on either the adverse interpretation or its residual beneficial alternative, the subject smoothly integrates two continuous signals: the difference in total marks and a partially count-residualized validity-weighted difference. The count signal normally dominates, while the weighted signal supplies graded sensitivity to which experts carry the marks on every trial. The two semantic interpretations generate opposite choice distributions, which are averaged according to the subject's polarity confidence. A small lapse process captures stimulus-independent errors.

**Parameters:**

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This is the margin-one minus exact-tie change in choosing the option whose marked ratings are concentrated among the more valid experts. Residual-validity alignment folds the A/B-reversed trials together, so all 96 observations contribute coherently and each subject supplies 48 observations per margin condition. Crucially, adding the validity-0.75 mark changes the count margin but, because 0.75 is exactly the mean validity, leaves centered validity evidence unchanged. Smooth Integration therefore predicts that this added count/uncentered-weight signal increases choice of the high-validity-marked side, yielding a positive contrast. The discrepancy-evoked audit instead amplifies the unchanged adverse residual at margin one and predicts a negative contrast. Averaging across all eight matched configurations, their reversals, and three repetitions should keep trial noise and between-subject variance relatively low."
