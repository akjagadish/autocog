# feedback_iter_04

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_9`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_11`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_11`).

Replace pi_11 with a new Static Tie-Gated Configural Competition theory. It should preserve the empirically supported assumptions shared by the candidates—communicated-validity weighting, option-level coalition integration, stable subject heterogeneity, and no trial-history updating—but differ from both in four central claims. First, serial precedence should be activated by exact or psychologically categorized equality at the top, with an extremely narrow or discrete gate; it should produce strong tied-cue primacy in Experiments 3, 7, and 17 while remaining essentially absent at the 0.0052 gap in Experiment 2. Second, the theory should deny any effect of absolute cue-index span once active-cue identities, validities, directions, and active serial ranks are fixed, matching Experiments 1 and 20; presentation order may matter, but empty positions between cues should not. Third, coalition competition should be nonmonotonic in credible opponent multiplicity: sparse credible dissent can overturn an isolated validity anchor, intermediate coalitions can maximize challenge, and broad participation can trigger anchor recovery. This mechanism should be strong enough to capture Experiments 8, 11, 13, and especially 19, while still allowing coalitions to defeat the highest-validity cue in Experiments 4, 12, and 15. Fourth, adding a cue should alter context-normalized coalition coherence or response precision, not merely add independent evidence, so that the positive activation and balance effects in Experiments 5 and 14 are possible. Use a small number of theoretically meaningful latent subject orientations—such as exact-tie lexicographic, configural integrator, and anchor-restoration types—with correlated parameters rather than unrestricted mechanisms. Parameter ranges should suppress near-tie serial effects, eliminate spatial-span terms, permit stronger high-count restoration and stronger coalition overturning, and avoid the excessive crossover prevalence seen in Experiment 6. This would provide a genuinely distinct and stronger competitor to pi_9 rather than merely retuning the falsified continuous ambiguity theory.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Static Tie-Gated Configural Competition (STGCC) proposes that communicated validities establish a fixed reliability representation, but choices are made by competition between option-level coalitions rather than by adding independent cue votes. Within each coalition, support depends jointly on reliability, effective multiplicity, and context-normalized coherence, so activating an additional cue changes the organization and precision of the whole display. A uniquely strongest active cue serves as a provisional anchor. Credible opposition receives a sharply gap-selective, nonmonotonic challenge gain: singleton dissent has both a support-amplification channel and a bounded normalized-margin challenge, intermediate dissent can overturn an anchor, and sufficiently broad opposition can reactivate an isolated anchor. Sparse opposition is protected only when an isolated anchor has a clearly large communicated-validity advantage. Broad-participation restoration is jointly gated by opponent count and the fraction of the display occupied by opponents, with stronger upper-count recovery in capacity-bounded displays. Within multi-cue coalitions, the leverage of one unusually strong member is smoothly capped, preventing incidental cue allocation from producing a crossover while retaining identity-based reliability differences. Fully active, capacity-bounded configurations with multi-cue coalitions on both sides are resolved as saturated coalition competition rather than by the identity of one lower cue. Serial precedence is a separate categorical process activated only by exact or extremely narrowly categorized equality at the highest active validity. In tied-top conflict, balance compresses the competing configural margin rather than changing the serial gate itself, allowing categorical precedence to become relatively influential without creating near-tie effects. The model contains no spatial-span representation: inactive positions and distances between active cues have no effect. Stable heterogeneity is represented by three correlated orientations—exact-tie lexicographic, configural-integration, and anchor-restoration—and no trial-history updating occurs without correctness feedback.

`rationale`:
This is a localized extension of the accepted iteration-4 source. The coalition equations, exponential gap credibility, participation gate, two-member cap, saturated Experiment-4 safeguard, exact-tie tolerance, and absence of span and history terms are retained. Four targeted edits address the latest diagnosis. First, singleton dissent gains a bounded shift of the normalized anchor margin in addition to its existing support multiplier. Because the shift is multiplied by the accepted gap-credibility function, it can strongly lower lone-opponent adherence in Experiments 2, 6, and 10 without challenging clearly separated anchors. Second, an isolated sparse-anchor protection term reuses the existing sharp gap gate and is restricted to one or two opponents; this targets Experiment 9 while excluding the embedded anchor geometry of Experiment 13. Third, general restoration amplitude is reduced and its participation onset sharpened to limit the Experiment-11 overshoot, while capacity-bounded displays and the restoration orientation receive stronger upper-count recovery to preserve or improve Experiment 17 and increase behavioral heterogeneity. Fourth, positive balance precision is nearly removed. In exact tied-top conflict, balance instead compresses the configural core margin while leaving the categorical serial gate unchanged, allowing tied-cue precedence to dominate balanced displays in Experiment 3 without introducing a continuous near-tie or direct balance-dependent serial mechanism.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2701 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2082 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.2175 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.1785 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2078 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.1785.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed STGCC family: it has a narrow equality gate, no spatial-span term, static heterogeneous orientations, and configural nonmonotonic coalition competition. It also succeeds on the intended invariances and nulls, especially Experiments 7, 16, 18, and 20, and is reasonably close on Experiments 11–13. However, it does not yet capture the central cross-experiment coalition pattern. The largest failures are Experiment 6, where the predicted multiplicity contrast has the wrong sign (0.183 versus -0.545), and Experiment 17, where high-count anchor recovery is far too weak (0.048 versus 0.560). Experiment 9 likewise shows excessive coalition overturning of a strong anchor (anchor choice 0.301 versus 0.725). Conversely, highest-cue adherence remains too high in Experiment 2 (0.523 versus 0.324), showing that the model does not adequately distinguish credible close opposition from opposition to a clearly superior anchor. Experiment 4 is also a severe failure: it produces an 84% prevalence of a cue-alignment crossover that is absent in every real subject. The exact-tie/configural interaction is miscalibrated as well: Experiment 3 has the wrong sign (-0.137 versus 0.072), while tied-top adherence is somewhat excessive in Experiments 5 and 15. Across several experiments the simulated between-subject variance is much lower than observed, so the three orientations are not generating the relevant heterogeneity.
Rationale: Keep the STGCC mechanism family, but retune its existing gates rather than replacing it. The current count restoration is much too weak: strengthen restoration sharply at counts of roughly four or more and make its onset more discrete. That should address the jointly diagnostic failures in Experiments 6, 11, and especially 17. At the same time, make coalition challenge more gap-selective: combine a stronger challenge for genuinely close-validity opposition with a smaller challenge_gap_scale or sharper gap normalization, so close coalitions can lower top-cue adherence in Experiments 2, 10, and 13 without overturning the clearly superior anchor in Experiment 9. Experiment 4 indicates that coalition support is too sensitive to whether one particular strong lower cue joins the anchor; cap or normalize single-member leverage within coalition coherence so that Expert 1 alignment does not create a population-wide crossover. Finally, modestly reduce the effective tie-strength range and let the existing balance/coherence term contribute more in exactly tied displays; the present nearly lexicographic gate overpredicts Experiments 5 and 15 while yielding the wrong balanced-minus-imbalanced effect in Experiment 3. Preserve the very narrow tie tolerance and the complete absence of span terms. Broaden the correlated orientation effects—especially restoration strength and close-gap challenge—to better match the substantial human variance in Experiments 9, 11, 17, and 19 without introducing unrestricted subject-specific mechanisms.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2701 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2082 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision is a meaningful improvement and remains faithful to STGCC: the exact-tie gate is narrow, spatial span is absent, orientations are static, and coalition competition is configural and nonmonotonic. The changes successfully repaired Experiment 4 (0.84 to 0.04), improved the strong-anchor result in Experiment 9, preserved the nulls in Experiments 7, 18, and 20, and now closely fit Experiments 1, 5, and 12. Nevertheless, the central multiplicity pattern remains substantially wrong. Experiment 6 still has the opposite sign and a very large error (0.202 versus -0.545), while Experiment 17 still shows far too little high-count recovery (0.144 versus 0.560). The sharper restoration gate therefore improved recovery but remains effectively suppressed, likely because restoration is multiplicatively conditional on the validity-gap gate. The revised challenge calibration also moved several close-opposition results in the wrong direction: highest-cue adherence is now much too high in Experiments 2 (0.637 versus 0.324), 10 (0.672 versus 0.446), and 13 (0.459 versus 0.328). Experiment 3 retains the wrong interaction sign (-0.123 versus 0.072). Human heterogeneity also remains understated in important cases, particularly Experiments 9, 11, 17, and 19.
Rationale: Continue within STGCC and retain the successful cue-cap/saturated-competition repair for Experiment 4, the narrow serial equality tolerance, and the absence of span terms. The previous recommendation was accepted overall, so its high-count-restoration direction was productive, but simply increasing restoration strength further is unlikely to suffice. Instead, fix the conjunction of the restoration gates: at sufficiently high opponent counts, broad-participation recovery should have a positive floor or partially override the gap gate rather than being the product of count_gate and gap_gate. This should produce the large negative contrast in Experiment 6 and stronger positive recovery in Experiment 17 without affecting the two-opponent strong-anchor case in Experiment 9. For challenge, do not narrow the exponential gap scale further; that accepted change coincided with worse fits in Experiments 2, 10, and 13. Use a plateau-then-sharp-cutoff credibility normalization, or an intermediate gap scale between the previous and current settings, so genuinely close coalitions receive nearly full challenge while clearly separated anchors remain protected. Experiment 3 suggests a sign/allocation error in the balance modulation: increasing the serial tie gate on balanced displays appears to suppress rather than promote Expert 5's winner. Let balance increase configural coalition influence, or reduce the serial mixture weight on balanced exact ties, while retaining strong categorical tie precedence overall. Finally, increase separation specifically between the configural-challenge and restoration orientations, rather than broadly widening every parameter, to raise the currently deficient between-subject variance in recovery and anchor-choice metrics.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2082 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.2175 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains faithful to the prescribed STGCC family: serial precedence is narrowly tie-gated, coalition competition is static and configural, subject orientations are stable, and no spatial-span variable is present. It also preserves the exact fits or near-nulls in Experiments 1, 16, 18, and 20. However, this iteration was rejected by the accept gate and is worse overall than the accepted iteration 2 base. Its positive restoration floor improved the direction of Experiment 6 and raised recovery in Experiment 17, but did so too indiscriminately: Experiment 11 overshot sharply from 0.053 to 0.346 versus 0.109, while Experiment 6 remained far from the required -0.545 contrast and Experiment 17 remained below 0.560. The plateau challenge and balance changes also damaged several previously good fits. Experiment 5 fell from 0.780 to 0.687 versus 0.790, Experiment 12 fell from 0.356 to 0.224 versus 0.353, Experiment 3 became more negative rather than changing sign, and the null in Experiment 7 deteriorated. Although Experiments 2 and 13 improved, top-anchor adherence is still excessive there and in Experiment 10. Experiment 9 continues to show insufficient protection of a clearly superior anchor. Thus the rejected revision trades broad deterioration for only partial recovery on the principal multiplicity effects.
Rationale: Build the next revision on the unchanged accepted iteration 2 base. The previous recommendation to add a global positive restoration floor, replace credibility with a broad plateau, and subtract balance from the tie mixture was rejected, so do not repeat those changes. Instead, refine the existing nonmonotonic count mechanism with a broad-participation gate based jointly on opponent count and opponent_count / n_features. Restoration should remain weak for counts 2–3 and for incomplete participation, then rise steeply around four opponents or roughly 60–70% display participation and saturate. This can distinguish the count-4/5 recovery cells in Experiment 17 and the count-5/7 cells in Experiment 6 from the lower-count cells pooled into Experiment 11, avoiding the current Experiment 11 overshoot without invoking spatial span. Add a separately bounded singleton-challenge multiplier under the accepted gap-credibility function rather than globally increasing challenge or changing its normalization. Stronger close-gap singleton challenge should lower lone-opponent anchor adherence in Experiment 6 and help Experiments 2 and 10, while the existing gap cutoff should continue protecting the clearly superior two-opponent anchor in Experiment 9. Keep intermediate challenge independently calibrated so Experiment 13 can remain low without undoing Experiment 12. For Experiment 3, leave the categorical tie weight independent of display balance rather than reversing its balance slope again; place any balance effect in context-normalized coalition coherence or precision. Preserve the iteration 2 tie-strength range, which already fit Experiment 5. Finally, Experiment 19 should be addressed through active cue identities and validities, not span: modestly soften the hard 1.25 member cap for two-member opponent coalitions or use a smooth reliability cap, while retaining the saturated multi-coalition safeguard that repaired Experiment 4. These are localized in-family adjustments and should be varied by the existing challenge versus restoration orientations to raise the currently understated between-subject variance.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.2175 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.1785 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted iteration is a genuine improvement and remains faithful to the prescribed STGCC family. The participation gate and softened two-member cap improved Experiments 4, 12, 14, 17, and 19 while preserving the span nulls in Experiments 18 and 20, the history null in Experiment 16, and the exact fit in Experiment 1. Nevertheless, the model is not yet experiment-invariant. The largest failure remains Experiment 6: the predicted lone-versus-multiple-opponent contrast is essentially zero (-0.006) rather than strongly negative (-0.545). High-count recovery is still too weak in Experiment 17 (0.396 versus 0.560), yet it is already too strong in Experiment 11 (0.254 versus 0.109), showing that the new restoration gate is not sufficiently selective across configurations. Coalition challenge is also too weak for close or credible opposition: highest-cue adherence is much too high in Experiments 2 (0.636 versus 0.324), 10 (0.636 versus 0.446), and 13 (0.460 versus 0.328). At the same time, the clearly superior isolated anchor is insufficiently protected in Experiment 9 (0.461 versus 0.725). Experiment 3 still has the wrong balance-effect sign (-0.130 versus 0.072), so positive balance precision is amplifying the wrong configural winner rather than revealing tied-cue primacy. Smaller residual misses occur in Experiments 5 and 15. Between-subject variance remains markedly understated in Experiments 9, 11, 17, and 19, indicating that the three orientations differ less behaviorally than human subjects do.
Rationale: Retain the accepted participation gate, narrow equality tolerance, absence of span terms, saturated safeguard for Experiment 4, and active-identity treatment that improved Experiment 19. The previous localized advice was accepted, so these components should be extended rather than reversed. First, target Experiment 6 primarily through the singleton channel rather than by globally increasing broad restoration, which would worsen the existing Experiment 11 overshoot. Increase the effective singleton challenge or apply it as a bounded shift in normalized coalition margin instead of only a multiplicative support bonus. This should strongly reduce lone-opponent anchor adherence and also help Experiments 2 and 10. Strengthen intermediate challenge more modestly for the configural orientation to lower excessive anchor adherence in Experiment 13. Second, add a steep sparse-count, clear-validity-gap anchor-protection term within the existing restoration mechanism. It should operate for one or two opponents only when the communicated gap is clearly large, raising Experiment 9 without protecting the near-gap opposition in Experiments 2, 10, and 13. Third, slightly reduce the broad-participation restoration contribution that is producing the Experiment 11 overshoot, while sharpening its upper-count saturation rather than raising its global strength; retain a stronger restoration multiplier specifically for the anchor-restoration orientation so Experiment 17 can continue improving and human heterogeneity increases. Finally, do not alter tie tolerance or make the serial mixture directly balance-dependent. The current positive balance-precision term worsens Experiment 3; reduce it toward zero and let balance compress the configural core margin under tied-top conflict, allowing the unchanged categorical serial component to dominate balanced displays. This is a coalition-normalization adjustment, not a new serial mechanism, and should improve Experiment 3 without repeating the previously rejected negative tie-balance slope or sacrificing the reasonable tied-top fits in Experiments 5 and 15.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.1785 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2078 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

  "interpretation": "The candidate remains structurally faithful to STGCC: it is history-invariant, contains no spatial-span term, uses communicated-validity-weighted configural coalitions, and restricts serial precedence to an extremely narrow top-tie gate. It preserves strong fits for Experiments 1, 7, 14, 15, and 18 and the intended near-null in Experiment 20. However, this iteration was rejected by the accept gate and regresses from the accepted iteration-4 model on several central diagnostics. The new singleton shift and sparse protection do not work selectively: Experiment 6 moves from approximately zero to the wrong positive direction (0.128 versus -0.545), Experiment 10 rises sharply to 0.833 versus 0.446, and Experiment 2 remains much too anchor-consistent at 0.650 versus 0.324. Sparse protection repairs but overshoots Experiment 9 (0.826 versus 0.725) while likely counteracting challenge in other one- and two-opponent displays. The revision also reintroduces the crossover in Experiment 4, weakens recovery in Experiment 17, reverses the improvement in Experiment 19, and worsens Experiment 16. Although Experiment 11 improves and Experiment 3 becomes slightly less negative, neither improvement compensates for the broader deterioration. The principal unresolved empirical pattern is still the strong lone-versus-multiple reversal in Experiment 6 alongside moderate recovery in Experiment 11 and strong upper-count recovery in Experiment 17. Simulated between-subject variance also remains much too small in Experiments 9, 11, 17, and 19.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Build on the unchanged accepted iteration-4 base. The latest advice to add a normalized singleton-margin shift, sparse protection over one or two opponents, and tied-display margin compression was rejected by the gate, so do not repeat that bundle or simply increase its strengths. Instead, tune the existing nonmonotonic count/participation surface more selectively. Move the general restoration count threshold upward from roughly 3.5 toward the upper-count region, around 4.5\u20135 opponents, and make the transition sharp. This should reduce the Experiment-11 overshoot, because its high-count pool begins at three, while preferentially restoring the count-5/7 cells that can drive Experiment 6 negative. Preserve Experiment 17 through its already accepted capacity-bounded participation interaction: in six-cue displays, high participation can lower the effective threshold for the count-4/5 recovery cells without globally restoring count-3 configurations. Fit this as a count-by-participation interaction rather than another additive restoration bonus. Keep the accepted exponential gap credibility and the iteration-4 two-member cap; the rejected singleton shift and broad sparse-protection gate should be omitted. For Experiment 9, if protection is still needed, adjust only the existing gap dependence of restoration with a steeper, higher threshold and modest amplitude, so it applies to exceptionally separated isolated anchors rather than broadly to all one- or two-opponent cases such as Experiments 6 and 10. Retain the Experiment-4 saturated safeguard exactly, since modifying the surrounding challenge/protection balance allowed crossover prevalence to return. Finally, avoid another reversal of balance modulation. If tied primacy is tuned, use a narrow tie-strength range near the middle-to-upper part of the accepted range rather than balance-dependent compression; this may improve the still-negative Experiment-3 interaction and the underprediction in Experiment 5 while preserving the discrete equality gate. Maintain the absence of span terms and vary the sharpened upper-count threshold primarily across the existing restoration orientation to increase behavioral heterogeneity without adding a new mechanism family."
