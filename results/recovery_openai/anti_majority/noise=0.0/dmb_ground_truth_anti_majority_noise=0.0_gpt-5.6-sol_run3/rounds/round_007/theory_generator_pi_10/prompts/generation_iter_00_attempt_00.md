# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_9`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace ADCG with a Static Reliability-Band and Coalition-Reframing theory. The new theory should assume that communicated validities are encoded into bounded, subject-specific reliability bands rather than represented with exact numerical precision. Cues within the top band are treated as functionally tied, with presentation order used only to resolve that ambiguity; order should have little or no effect when one cue lies clearly above the band. This directly accommodates Experiments 1, 2, 6, and 7 without invoking trial-history learning.

Coalition influence should be display-based and nonmonotonic. Sparse or moderately sized, internally coherent opposition can reframe the choice and overturn the nominal best cue, accounting for Experiments 4, 12, and 15. As opposition becomes large or apparently redundant, its marginal credibility should saturate and an isolated high-reliability cue can recover, accounting for Experiments 8, 11, and 13. Activating one additional cue should be allowed to change the inferred configuration or response precision rather than merely adding linear evidence, as required by Experiment 14 and the balance effect in Experiment 5. Cue identity may affect current-display grouping, but repeated cue concurrence or opposition should not be learned in the absence of outcome feedback; this is essential for the null temporal results in Experiments 2, 9, and 16.

Unlike S3C, the new theory should frame these effects as discrete interpretation or reason-selection states—such as top-band resolution, diagnostic-coalition reframing, and high-multiplicity anchor protection—rather than smooth support restoration within one continuous competition equation. Stable subject-level variation should govern band width and the probability of entering each interpretation state, producing both mean behavior and the substantial observed between-subject variance. It should generate preregistered predictions for near-tie versus clear-maximum order effects, compact versus high-count opposition, and early-versus-late exposure null effects.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.678)

**Description**
Active-Cue Accessibility Competition (ACAC) proposes that people use a stable representation of communicated cue validity and evaluate only cues that discriminate on the current trial. Active cues first form option-specific coalitions. Coalition support accumulates smoothly but is compressed according to coalition size, validity similarity, and effective cue multiplicity, so additional concordant cues become increasingly redundant without triggering a categorical restoration rule. In unique-anchor configurations where both options have multiple active supporters, coalition evidence is additionally normalized toward effective coalition counts. This prevents the allocation of one relatively valid lower cue from producing an implicit presentation-order crossover. Decisions in this symmetrically normalized geometry are made with moderately greater response precision, reflecting reduced conflict after cue identities have been compressed; this suppresses sampling-induced primacy classifications and strengthens balanced-profile anchor evidence without introducing an order weight. The strongest currently active cue serves as a validity anchor. Opposition receives a sharply count-selective challenge enhancement centered on exactly one opponent. This enhancement is strongest for an isolated anchor and attenuated for embedded-anchor singleton dissent; larger opposing coalitions retain only a small, smooth inverse-count challenge tail. In the exact unique-anchor, isolated, one-opponent configuration, stable competition types form a heterogeneous mixture containing a small genuinely resistant group and a larger set of strongly challenge-accessible integrators. Challenge strength depends continuously on the anchor's absolute validity and validity advantage over the strongest opponent. Presentation order is consulted only when multiple currently active cues share maximal communicated validity. A bounded active-tie gate favors the earliest member of that tied set, with an additional conflict-geometry increment when lower-validity active cues precede tied maxima supporting opposing options. Inactive co-top cues cannot activate either component. Tie accessibility retains the same marginal distribution across subject types as in the previous model. Because the task provides no correctness feedback, ACAC explicitly excludes trial-history learning of cue concurrence, anti-concurrence, or discrimination frequency.

**Description**
Static Configuration-Contingent Integration (SCCI) claims that people form a fixed, instruction-based representation of cue reliability and apply it to the directional evidence profile on each trial. Each discriminating cue contributes reliability-weighted evidence, so independently supporting cues accumulate, while concordant cues are compressed as potentially redundant. This compression increases moderately convexly with coalition size, reflecting the declining informational value of each additional concordant cue. A bounded configuration gate supplements integration: strong protection of a uniquely most-valid cue is restricted to profiles in which that cue is isolated, has a sufficiently large communicated-validity advantage, and faces multiple concordant opponents. Cue uniqueness functions primarily as a tie detector, while a separate raw validity-gap criterion determines whether restoration is warranted. The transition to restoration is sharp, allowing an isolated anchor to be weak against one credible challenger but strongly protected against a redundant multi-cue bloc. Compact challenge amplification is strictly limited to isolated anchors and therefore cannot create general primacy effects when the anchor has allies. When the most-valid discriminating cues have equal communicated validity, they remain exchangeable in the integrator, but stable display order supplies a bounded tie-breaking anchor. Choices are history-invariant because concurrence, anti-concurrence, and discrimination frequency are not learned without correctness feedback. Stable profile heterogeneity arises from subject-level variation in validity sensitivity, coalition integration, redundancy, isolated-anchor challenge and restoration, tie-order bias, temperature, and lapse.

**Description**
Static Configural Coalition Competition (S3C) proposes that decisions are reconstructed from the current cue display without learning from trial history. Each discriminating expert retains an identity-specific weight derived from communicated validity, but validity evidence is bounded to prevent a uniquely most-valid cue from becoming arbitrarily dominant. Serial accessibility is a distinct regime that is exactly absent under a clear unique maximum and operates only among genuinely tied or extremely near-tied active cues. Option-specific evidence accumulates with smooth within-coalition redundancy. Compact one- and two-cue opposition receives a display-based diagnosticity bonus, while the credibility of a coalition is computed through a bounded aggregation of its members' validity gaps so that moving one cue cannot induce a quasi-discrete change in competition. The effects of credibility and anchor isolation are likewise softly bounded. At larger opposition multiplicities, compact diagnosticity decays and a saturating restoration process can return choice toward a strong isolated anchor. This restoration receives a smooth pre-sigmoid increment when an effectively isolated anchor faces more than two opponents, while embedded anchors remain protected from that increment. Exact balance versus one-step imbalance can modulate response precision without changing evidence direction, allowing activation of an additional cue to sharpen an already configured coalition preference. Stable subject differences jointly vary validity compression, tied-cue accessibility, compact-dissent sensitivity, restoration, balance sensitivity, and response precision. In the absence of outcome feedback, no aspect of the model updates from trial history.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL
Propose a novel theory from scratch based on all the information available, faithfully implementing the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed above. Do NOT simply reuse anything generated in past rounds.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- theory: The theoretical claim this theory makes about cognition.
- predict: Python source defining def predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray.
- policy: Python source defining def policy(probs) -> int.
- parameters: Parameter ranges (e.g. "[1.0, 10.0]") or choices (e.g. "{1, 2}"), sampled per subject.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this theory design; used to explain why this theory is better then the previous ones.


## Response

```json
{
  "theory": "Reliability-Band Interpretation Switching (RBIS) proposes that communicated cue validities are encoded as ordinal reliability bands rather than exact numerical weights. On each display, the decision maker identifies the highest occupied band and an initial anchor reason. If several active cues occupy that band, they are functionally tied and serial order selects the provisional anchor; if only one cue occupies it, serial order has no influence. The entire current display is then classified into one of four mutually exclusive interpretation states: top-band resolution, diagnostic-coalition reframing, high-multiplicity anchor protection, or residual banded integration. Reframing is most likely when a compact, coherent opposition supplies an alternative interpretation, including singleton dissent and balanced embedded coalitions. It reverses the provisional anchor rather than adding continuously to its evidence. Protection instead applies when an isolated anchor faces a sufficiently large and hence redundant opposition, when a high-count display stabilizes a tied top-band reason, or when a one-step count imbalance makes an embedded high-band anchor a salient minority reason. Displays not meeting a categorical state criterion are resolved by a coarse band-weighted and redundancy-compressed vote. Stable subject differences in band width, state thresholds, protection boundaries, and response precision produce persistent strategy heterogeneity.

  "rationale": "RBIS implements the arbiter's requested mechanism as genuinely discrete reason-selection states rather than as another smooth coalition competition equation. Reliability bands make order consequential when communicated validities are psychologically indistinguishable, while guaranteeing that order has no direct effect under a clearly occupied maximum band. Compact opposition can categorically replace the initial reason, explaining reversals that ordinary additive integration cannot generate. The distinct protection state makes coalition influence nonmonotonic: one or two diagnostic opponents can trigger reframing, whereas larger opposition against an isolated anchor is treated as redundant and restores the anchor. The same state architecture allows an added cue to change the interpretation of a profile—particularly through one-step minority protection—instead of merely contributing another evidence increment. Singleton dissent remains capable of reframing a large majority, accommodating displays where one conspicuous dissenter changes the selected rationale. Stable interpretation types correlate band use, reframing propensity, and protection thresholds, yielding durable between-subject variation without temporal learning. The model predicts strong order effects for conflicting cues inside the same top band, negligible order effects across a clear band boundary, minimum anchor adherence under compact coherent opposition, recovery under high-count opposition to an isolated anchor, and exactly zero systematic early-versus-late learning because history is ignored."
