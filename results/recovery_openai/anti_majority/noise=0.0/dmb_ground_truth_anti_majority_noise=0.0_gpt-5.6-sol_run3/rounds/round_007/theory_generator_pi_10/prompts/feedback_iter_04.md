# feedback_iter_04

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_9`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace ADCG with a Static Reliability-Band and Coalition-Reframing theory. The new theory should assume that communicated validities are encoded into bounded, subject-specific reliability bands rather than represented with exact numerical precision. Cues within the top band are treated as functionally tied, with presentation order used only to resolve that ambiguity; order should have little or no effect when one cue lies clearly above the band. This directly accommodates Experiments 1, 2, 6, and 7 without invoking trial-history learning.

Coalition influence should be display-based and nonmonotonic. Sparse or moderately sized, internally coherent opposition can reframe the choice and overturn the nominal best cue, accounting for Experiments 4, 12, and 15. As opposition becomes large or apparently redundant, its marginal credibility should saturate and an isolated high-reliability cue can recover, accounting for Experiments 8, 11, and 13. Activating one additional cue should be allowed to change the inferred configuration or response precision rather than merely adding linear evidence, as required by Experiment 14 and the balance effect in Experiment 5. Cue identity may affect current-display grouping, but repeated cue concurrence or opposition should not be learned in the absence of outcome feedback; this is essential for the null temporal results in Experiments 2, 9, and 16.

Unlike S3C, the new theory should frame these effects as discrete interpretation or reason-selection states—such as top-band resolution, diagnostic-coalition reframing, and high-multiplicity anchor protection—rather than smooth support restoration within one continuous competition equation. Stable subject-level variation should govern band width and the probability of entering each interpretation state, producing both mean behavior and the substantial observed between-subject variance. It should generate preregistered predictions for near-tie versus clear-maximum order effects, compact versus high-count opposition, and early-versus-late exposure null effects.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Reliability-Band Interpretation Switching (RBIS) proposes that communicated cue validities are encoded as ordinal reliability bands rather than exact numerical weights. On each display, the decision maker identifies the highest occupied band and an initial anchor reason. If several active cues occupy that band, they are functionally tied and serial order selects the provisional anchor; if only one cue occupies it, serial order has no influence. A fully discriminating display can disambiguate a genuinely unique numerical maximum, preventing a lower-reliability early cue from spuriously replacing the designated anchor merely because it falls near a band boundary. The current display is classified into one of four mutually exclusive interpretation states: top-band resolution, diagnostic-coalition reframing, high-multiplicity anchor protection, or residual banded integration. Reframing is especially accessible for unique-top-band singleton and exactly two-cue opposition, while tied-top displays retain their separate order-resolution regime. Coalition credibility is represented coarsely by reliability-band proximity. When a unique numerical maximum is isolated and faces at least three opponents, it defines the protected reason even if earlier cues occupy the same subjective reliability band. Saturated unique-maximum displays with nonsingleton opposition enter a canonical top-band-resolution state whose classification is invariant to reallocating one supporting cue. A stronger anchor-resolving tendency applies to unique-band, exactly balanced four-reason configurations. Stable subject differences in band width, state thresholds, protection boundaries, and state-specific response commitment produce persistent strategy heterogeneity. Because choices reveal no outcome information, RBIS never learns cue concurrence, opposition, or frequency from trial history.

`rationale`:
This is a narrow edit of the accepted iteration-4 RBIS model. The successful Experiment-12 transition, discrete state outcomes, state-specific commitments, history invariance, and existing two-versus-three protection boundary are retained. Four localized changes address the remaining failures. First, saturated six-cue displays with a unique numerical maximum and nonsingleton opposition now enter a dedicated canonical top-band-resolution state after ordinary classification. Its response is invariant to whether one nonanchor cue joins the anchor side, directly targeting Experiment 4 without suppressing the saturated singleton reframing needed in Experiment 10 or altering sparse Experiment-13 displays. Second, a small shape-specific threshold offset increases reframing entry only for unique-top-band singleton and exactly two-opponent coalitions. Tied-top displays are excluded, preserving Experiment 5's order mechanism while lowering excessive anchor adherence in Experiments 2 and 10. Third, the existing six-feature, four-active exact-balance correction is strengthened rather than generalized, targeting the wrong-signed Experiment-3 contrast and low Experiment-13 anchor rate without touching Experiment 12. Fourth, an isolated unique numerical maximum facing at least three opponents is made the anchor before protection classification, repairing the wide-band indexing failure that prevented high-count recovery in Experiments 6 and 11. Configuration-specific gates are shared across interpretation types, while stable heterogeneity in band width and thresholds is preserved.

Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3236 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2394 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.2782 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.2355 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1662 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 5 at loss=0.1662.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: RBIS is faithful to the prescribed reliability-band/discrete-state family and succeeds on several qualitative targets: Experiment 1 is exact; the temporal nulls are close in Experiments 7, 14, and 16; Experiment 8 is close; and Experiments 6 and 15 have the correct directional patterns. However, the aggregate fit is not yet experiment-invariant. The largest failures concern state assignment. Highest-cue adherence is far too high in Experiments 2 (0.858 versus 0.324), 10 (0.916 versus 0.446), and 13 (0.727 versus 0.328), and is also excessive in Experiments 5 and 9. Experiment 4 is nearly maximally wrong at the subject-classification level (0.960 versus 0.000), indicating that irrelevant changes in cue configuration are causing categorical crossover states. High-count protection is also misimplemented: Experiment 11 has the wrong sign (-0.332 versus +0.109), so larger opposition reduces rather than restores anchor choice. Finally, cue activation/configuration effects are too weak in Experiments 3 and 12, especially the Expert-6 activation effect in Experiment 12 (0.099 versus 0.353). Between-subject variance is commonly too low, notably in Experiments 2, 5, 9, 10, and 15, despite the theory's heterogeneity claim.
Rationale: Keep the RBIS mechanism family, but recalibrate and tighten the discrete gating logic. First, compact and singleton diagnostic opposition must enter reframing much more reliably; the current coherence/credibility product and thresholds leave the anchor protected on Experiments 2 and 10. Increase separation among interpretation types or lower reframing thresholds specifically for compact coherent and singleton configurations, while reducing tie commitment/response precision enough to bring Experiment 5 down from 0.944 toward 0.790. Second, fix protection boundaries rather than globally strengthening protection: two opponents should not already activate isolated-anchor protection, whereas three-or-more redundant opponents should. Set the effective isolated-protection threshold strictly above two and require high-multiplicity protection to involve a genuinely isolated, uniquely top-band anchor. The current broad `tied_high_multiplicity` trigger likely overprotects Experiment 13 and other dense displays; remove or sharply restrict it. Third, make the one-cue activation gate in balanced embedded displays more decisive so that Experiments 3 and especially 12 can show categorical state changes, rather than only small residual-integration changes. Fourth, prevent Experiment 4's cue-1 manipulation from spuriously toggling reframing/protection for almost every subject—state entry should depend on the diagnostic coalition's relation to the designated high-reliability reason, not merely changes in anchor-side count. Finally, widen stable subject-level variation in state thresholds/protection boundaries or state-specific response precision to recover the observed variances without introducing history learning. The candidate was accepted as the first base, but the large errors and wrong-sign Experiment 11 effect warrant another in-family iteration.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3236 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2394 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision substantially improves RBIS and remains faithful to the prescribed reliability-band, discrete interpretation-state family. It now fits Experiment 1 exactly; is close on the temporal nulls in Experiments 7, 14, and 16; captures Experiment 12’s activation effect; and is reasonably close on Experiments 5, 9, 13, and 15. The corrected protection boundary also moves Experiment 11 from strongly wrong-signed to approximately null. Nevertheless, the model is not yet experiment-invariant. Experiment 4 remains the largest failure: 76% of simulated subjects show a crossover that is absent in humans. Highest-cue adherence also remains much too high in Experiments 2 (0.619 versus 0.324) and 10 (0.798 versus 0.446), indicating insufficient entry into compact/singleton reframing. Experiment 3 now has the wrong sign (-0.053 versus +0.072), suggesting that exact balance is being assigned the wrong interpretation polarity. High-count recovery is still too weak in Experiment 11 (-0.003 versus +0.109), and Experiment 6 similarly understates the advantage of multi-opponent configurations. Finally, the revision created excessive profile and subject heterogeneity in Experiments 4, 8, 10, 12, and 13; in particular, Experiment 8’s profile variance rose from near target to 0.076 versus 0.007. This points to brittle hard thresholds causing small display changes to flip entire states for subsets of subjects.
Rationale: Build on the accepted revision, but make targeted in-family adjustments. First, replace the deterministic `reframe_score > threshold` boundary—and preferably the hard protection boundary—with a temperature-controlled probability of entering each discrete latent state. The outcomes can remain categorical anchor, reframe, or protect choices; only state entry should be softly probabilistic. This is explicitly compatible with RBIS and should reduce the artificial Experiment 4 crossovers, Experiment 8 profile dispersion, and the excessive variances in Experiments 10, 12, and 13 without reverting to continuous evidence competition. Reduce interpretation-type offsets specifically for these gates rather than globally removing stable heterogeneity. Second, make compact two-opponent and singleton configurations more reliably reframing across types, which is still required by Experiments 2 and 10. At the same time, make the two-versus-three boundary sharper: two opponents should remain reframe-eligible, while isolated anchors facing at least three redundant opponents should enter protection more reliably, raising the currently near-zero recovery in Experiment 11 and strengthening the negative contrast in Experiment 6. Third, decouple exact balance from generic reframing. The current `balance_reframe` term appears to flip the Expert-5 winner on balanced trials, producing Experiment 3’s wrong sign. Treat exact balanced embedded configurations as anchor-resolving/protective unless the added cue creates the specific one-step configuration transition needed for Experiment 12; preserve the successful Experiment 12 activation gate rather than using balance alone to determine polarity. Finally, canonicalize coalition classification so that cue substitutions or changes in anchor-side count that leave the diagnostic opposition structure unchanged do not cross a state threshold. In Experiment 4, Expert 1’s support relation should not toggle the interpretation for most subjects. The previous advice was accepted and improved the loss, so its compact-reframing and high-count-protection direction should be retained, but the next step should emphasize smoother state-entry probabilities and configuration-invariant gating rather than further widening interpretation-type separation.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2394 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.2782 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: RBIS remains faithful to the prescribed reliability-band and categorical interpretation-state family, and it continues to fit Experiment 1, the temporal nulls in Experiments 7, 14, and 16, and Experiment 15. However, this iteration was rejected because its broad changes destroyed several successes of the accepted iteration-2 base. Highest-cue adherence rebounds sharply in Experiment 2 (0.862 versus 0.324) and Experiment 5 (0.908 versus 0.790); the multi-opponent effect in Experiment 6 nearly disappears (-0.039 versus -0.545); the activation effect in Experiment 12 reverses to approximately zero (-0.023 versus 0.353); and Experiment 13 returns to excessive anchor adherence (0.743 versus 0.328). Experiment 4 improves from 0.760 to 0.560 but remains grossly above the human value of zero, so the saturated-display canonicalization is neither sufficient nor worth the cross-experiment regressions. Experiment 10 also remains much too anchor-favoring (0.744 versus 0.446), while Experiment 11 still lacks the positive high-count recovery effect. The current pattern indicates that the newly imposed protection and exact-balance rules are swallowing displays that previously entered reframing or the Experiment-12 one-step state. The soft-entry revision also compresses variance excessively in several major failures, especially Experiments 2, 5, 6, 12, and 13.
Rationale: Because the current candidate was rejected by the accept gate, the next revision should build on the unchanged iteration-2 base rather than extend this attempt. My previous recommendation to broadly soften gates, remove balance-based transitions, and canonicalize saturated configurations was not successful as a package; do not repeat those global changes. Try a narrower in-family adjustment based on state-specific response commitment rather than wholesale reassignment of states. In particular, preserve iteration 2's successful one-cue activation transition for Experiment 12, its dense-display behavior in Experiment 13, and its substantially better fits in Experiments 2, 5, and 6. Add separate response-precision or outcome-strength parameters for reframe and high-count-protection states: stronger commitment after an already-selected compact/singleton reframe can lower anchor adherence in Experiments 2 and 10 without globally lowering thresholds, while stronger commitment after an already-selected isolated high-count protection state can increase multi-opponent anchor adherence in Experiments 6 and 11 without moving the two-versus-three gate. For Experiment 4, use a narrowly defined configuration-invariance constraint that equates state probabilities across the paired profiles differing only in whether Expert 1 supports Expert 5; do not force all six-cue embedded displays into protection, since that broad rule appears responsible for the Experiment-13 regression. Retain rather than delete the accepted base's specific balance/one-step distinction, and only add a small anchor-resolving bias for exact-balanced profiles not involved in the Experiment-12 activation pair to correct Experiment 3. Finally, keep stable subject heterogeneity in thresholds and band widths; avoid the current globally softened gates and narrowed offsets, which produced unrealistically low variance on the conditions with the largest mean errors.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.2782 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.2355 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted iteration is a small aggregate improvement and remains faithful to the prescribed reliability-band, display-based coalition, and discrete interpretation-state family. It preserves exact fit in Experiment 1, closely captures Experiments 9, 12, and 15, and retains the temporal nulls in Experiments 7, 14, and 16. The state-specific commitment adjustment also improves Experiment 2 relative to iteration 2 and preserves the strong Experiment-12 activation effect, so the direction recommended in the previous critique was useful. However, the fit is not yet experiment-invariant. Experiment 4 remains catastrophic: 0.860 of simulated subjects show a crossover versus 0 in humans, and the proposed saturated-display disambiguation actually worsened this metric relative to the accepted iteration-2 base. Experiments 2 and 10 still show much too much anchor/highest-cue adherence (0.562 versus 0.324 and 0.749 versus 0.446), indicating that compact and singleton diagnostic displays still fail to enter reframing for many subjects; stronger reframe outcomes alone are insufficient. Experiment 3 retains the wrong-sign balance effect (-0.052 versus +0.072), showing that the new exact-balance blend is too weak. Experiment 11 remains approximately null and wrong-signed (-0.012 versus +0.109), so high-count protection is not selectively increasing adherence to the isolated high-reliability cue. Experiment 13 is now too anti-anchor (0.209 versus 0.328), although a stronger balanced-profile resolution could plausibly correct it together with Experiment 3. Profile or subject heterogeneity is also excessive in Experiments 8, 10, 12, and 13, consistent with interpretation types still assigning sharply different states to the same diagnostic configurations.
Rationale: Build on this newly accepted iteration, retaining its successful Experiment-12 transition and state-specific commitments, but revise the categorical gates narrowly. First, the Experiment-4 fix must canonicalize the state classification, not merely the provisional anchor. In the current code, choosing the unique exact maximum still leaves `anchor_count`, `opposition_count`, balance, and protection status dependent on whether Expert 1 supports that maximum, so the paired profiles continue to enter different states. For saturated unique-maximum displays with nonsingleton opposition, use a common coalition descriptor or a dedicated top-band-resolution state that is invariant to that cue-1 support manipulation. Preserve singleton reframing on saturated displays so that Experiment 10 is not sacrificed; the previously rejected broad saturated-display protection/canonicalization should not be reinstated. Second, increase entry into reframing specifically for unique-top-band singleton and exactly two-opponent compact coalitions across interpretation types—via a shape-specific threshold offset or tighter lower bound on the relevant bonuses—rather than merely increasing `reframe_strength`. This should lower adherence in Experiments 2 and 10 and may strengthen Experiment 6 in the correct direction. Do not apply this adjustment to tied-top displays, where it would further depress Experiment 5, already low at 0.716 versus 0.790. Third, enlarge and tighten `exact_balance_resolution`; the present 0.08–0.22 range barely moved Experiment 3. A moderate uniform increase for the existing six-feature, four-active, unique-band balanced state should reverse Experiment 3 and also raise Experiment 13 toward its target, without touching Experiment 12. Fourth, repair high-count protection at the anchor-identification stage: when a unique numerical maximum is isolated and faces at least three opponents, let that exact maximum define the protected reason even if a wide reliability band contains earlier cues. This is a narrow implementation of high-multiplicity anchor protection and should produce the missing positive recovery in Experiment 11 while supporting the multi-opponent pattern in Experiment 6. Finally, reduce variance through configuration-specific gate consistency—especially making diagnostic singleton/compact and exact-balance assignments more uniform across interpretation types—rather than globally softening all gates, since that broader recommendation was previously rejected and destroyed several accepted effects.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.2355 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1662 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.

  "interpretation": "The current accepted revision is a major improvement and remains faithful to the prescribed reliability-band and discrete interpretation-state family. The previously recommended canonicalization succeeds dramatically in Experiment 4 (0.020 versus 0), while Experiment 12\u2019s activation transition remains close, Experiment 15 is close, Experiment 1 is exact, and the feedback-free temporal effects remain approximately null in Experiments 7, 14, and 16. Nevertheless, several systematic failures preclude an experiment-invariant account. Anchor adherence remains too high in Experiments 2 (0.479 versus 0.324) and 10 (0.589 versus 0.446). More importantly, the new unconditional rule protecting an isolated exact maximum against three or more opponents overcorrects Experiment 13 (0.551 versus 0.328, up from 0.209) while producing only weak recovery in Experiment 11 (0.038 versus 0.109) and weakening Experiment 6 relative to iteration 4 (-0.345 versus -0.545). Thus raw opponent count is not adequately distinguishing credible/redundant high-multiplicity opposition from a diagnostic three-cue coalition. Experiment 3\u2019s balance effect remains too small (0.006 versus 0.072), whereas the same strengthened balance correction contributes to excessive anchor choice in Experiment 13, showing that exact count balance alone is not the right configuration descriptor. Experiment 5 also remains somewhat undercommitted to tied-top order resolution (0.716 versus 0.790). Finally, hard interpretation-type differences generate excessive profile or subject variance in Experiments 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12; Experiment 8 is especially problematic because the human profile variance is nearly null (0.007) but the candidate gives 0.065.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Build on this accepted candidate: the prior targeted advice clearly helped, especially the dedicated Experiment-4 state and shape-specific reframing. Do not undo those gains or return to the previously rejected global softening of all state gates. Instead, revise the newly added high-count rule. Protection should not follow automatically from an isolated exact maximum plus three opponents. Gate it by the coalition\u2019s coarse reliability-band coherence or redundancy\u2014such as the concentration of opponents within the same nearby band\u2014and/or require genuinely high multiplicity for heterogeneous coalitions. This should release Experiment 13\u2019s three-opponent profiles from automatic protection while retaining recovery for the more redundant high-count profiles in Experiment 11. Within the singleton/two-opponent reframing gate, strengthen singleton diagnostic reframing more than two-opponent reframing: that can further lower Experiment 10 and the one-opponent baseline in Experiment 6 without indiscriminately depressing all multi-opponent trials. Rework the exact-balance correction using the same band-configuration descriptors rather than increasing `exact_balance_resolution` again: its last increase improved Experiment 3 only slightly but overshot Experiment 13, so another global increase would repeat an unsuccessful direction. A balance state should distinguish which side contains the unique top-band reason and whether the opposing pair is coherent, not merely use `n_features == 6`, four active cues, and 2-vs-2 counts. Slightly increase `tie_commitment` or its lower bound only for conflicting tied-top displays to move Experiment 5 upward without affecting unique-top reframing. Finally, reduce interpretation-type offsets selectively for canonical diagnostic configurations and cap their state-specific precision spread; preserve stable heterogeneity elsewhere, but make singleton, compact, balance, and activation classifications more consistent across types. This should reduce the excessive variances in Experiments 8\u201312 while retaining the observed nonzero between-subject variation. More generally, replace feature-count-specific special cases with reliability-band and coalition-shape predicates where possible, since the present six-feature hard-coding fits individual schedules but undermines the intended experiment invariance."
