## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended decision-making theories make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every theory agrees, and prefer pairs that maximally dissociate the candidate theories. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Dominance-Calibrated Saturating Coalitions (DCSC) proposes that people classify the communicated validity profile before evaluating individual options. A cue activates a dominance regime when it accounts for a sufficiently large share of total diagnosticity and the profile as a whole is concentrated rather than broadly distributed across similarly informative cues. In that regime, the highest-validity discriminating cue anchors the decision, while the remaining cues provide only a small, order-invariant adjustment. Without sufficient profile-level dominance, people enter a compensatory regime and accumulate signed reliability evidence from every discriminating cue. Reliability differences are compressed, and repeated support for the same option has diminishing marginal impact, representing perceived redundancy among concordant experts. Thus, several lower-validity cues can collectively defeat the best discriminating cue, but neither early nor late serial position is intrinsically favored. Evidential balance can induce additional deliberation, modeled as a modest increase in choice consistency rather than a directional recency rule. Stable individual differences concern the dominance threshold, sensitivity to profile concentration, compression and saturation of reliability evidence, leakage of coalition evidence into dominance decisions, deliberation under conflict, and response sensitivity.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] Eight experts have strictly ordered, widely separated validities. Every pair creates a conflict between Take The Best and Tallying: the highest-validity discriminating expert favors one option, while the majority of discriminating experts favors the other. The design orthogonally balances whether A or B is favored by the decisive expert and manipulates the opposing tally margin. In trials where Expert 1 discriminates, the tally margins are 2, 4, and 6; where Expert 1 ties and Expert 2 is the first discriminating expert, the margins are 1, 3, and 5. Take The Best therefore predicts the same choice probability for the option favored by the first discriminating expert on every trial: epsilon/2 + (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta), invariant to both cue rank and tally margin. Tallying predicts that this option is chosen below chance, with probability epsilon/2 + (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(-beta*m), and predicts a systematic decrease as the opposing margin m increases. Thus, the critical dissociation is both directional and quantitative: invariant support for the top-cue winner under TTB versus increasingly strong rejection of it under Tallying. Swapping A and B for each evidence pattern controls response-side preferences. The 12 unique pairs yield exactly 96 trials with eight repetitions per pair.

[1] This design targets the parameter-free prediction of Tallying on exactly balanced evidence. On every trial, A and B win on the same number of discriminating features, so Tallying predicts P(A)=P(B)=0.5 for every beta and epsilon. Nevertheless, each pair has a uniquely defined first discriminating expert in descending-validity order. Take The Best therefore predicts choice of that expert's favored option with probability epsilon/2 + (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta), which is strictly above chance throughout the stated parameter ranges. The six underlying evidence patterns vary both the rank of the first discriminating expert (1, 3, or 5) and the total number of discriminating experts (2, 4, 6, or 8), while preserving an exactly tied tally. Take The Best predicts the same above-chance preference across these manipulations, whereas Tallying remains exactly at chance. Each pattern is paired with an A/B reversal, controlling response-side bias. Thus the critical statistic is the probability of choosing the option favored by the first discriminating expert: exactly 0.5 under Tallying versus a common value above 0.5 under Take The Best. The 12 unique pairs are repeated eight times for 96 trials.

[2] The design exploits a sharp conflict-gated crossover unique to CGRDA while holding Take The Best's decisive cue constant. Expert 5 has the highest validity (0.95) and always discriminates in favor of the designated TTB winner. Each family contains an exactly balanced 2-versus-2 trial and a matched 3-versus-1 trial differing only in Expert 1's direction. On balanced trials, the final discriminating expert (Expert 6) opposes Expert 5. TTB therefore chooses Expert 5's option with the same probability q = epsilon/2 + (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta) on every trial. CGRDA instead predicts the Expert-6 option on every balanced trial throughout its parameter ranges: tally balance fully opens the recency gate, and recency_strength is at least 1.15 while normalized core evidence is bounded in magnitude by 1. On matched imbalanced trials, reversing Expert 1 creates three endorsements for the TTB winner versus one final endorsement for its opponent. The imbalance of two suppresses recency by at least exp(-5), while the early Expert-1 endorsement and two additional concordant endorsements make CGRDA favor the TTB winner. Thus, the critical statistic is the probability of choosing the Expert-5 winner: TTB predicts invariance between balanced and imbalanced conditions, whereas CGRDA predicts a crossover from below chance on balanced trials to above chance on imbalanced trials. Moving the second pro-TTB endorsement across Experts 2, 3, and 4 provides an additional serial-position manipulation: TTB remains invariant, while CGRDA's integrated evidence changes with primacy. Exact A/B reversals control response-side bias. The 12 unique pairs are each repeated eight times, yielding 96 trials.

[3] This design isolates CGRDA's serial-position weighting and redundancy discounting while holding constant every determinant of Take The Best. All six cues discriminate, Expert 5 (index 4) is uniquely most valid at 0.95, and it always favors the designated TTB winner. Every trial also has the same 4-versus-2 endorsement tally, and the final cue always favors the TTB winner. TTB therefore predicts one common probability q = epsilon/2 + (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta) of selecting the designated winner across all patterns. The two cues opposing that winner are moved among the first four serial positions. CGRDA predicts a sharp position-dependent reversal: when the compact opposing pair includes the highly reliable first-position cue (sets {1,2}, {1,3}, or {1,4} in one-based numbering), primacy and redundancy discounting allow those two early endorsements to defeat four later, partly redundant endorsements, producing below-chance selection of the TTB winner. When the opposing pair excludes the first cue ({2,3}, {2,4}, or {3,4}), the TTB winner receives the dominant first-position endorsement and should be selected above chance. This is not a recency-gate effect: the tally imbalance is always two, limiting the gate to exp(-5) or less, and the last cue's direction is fixed. Thus the critical quantitative statistic is the change in TTB-winner choice probability depending on whether Expert 1 opposes or supports that winner: TTB predicts exactly zero change, whereas CGRDA predicts a large crossover. Exact A/B reversals control response-side preference. The 12 unique pairs are repeated eight times for 96 trials.

[4] The validity profile contains four validity-matched cue pairs but remains broad enough to force DCSC into its compensatory regime. Using the most dominance-favoring allowed profile-shape weight, the profile's dominance score is approximately 0.212, still below the minimum dominance threshold of 0.285; hence the dominance gate is at most about 0.006. On every trial, the two highest-validity experts discriminate in opposite directions. Because their validities are tied, Take The Best uses its stable ordering rule and follows Expert 1, predicting the same probability q = epsilon/2 + (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta) for Expert 1's option on every trial. DCSC instead averages the opposing tied anchors, making anchor evidence exactly zero. One or more lower-validity experts then unanimously support Expert 2's option, so DCSC's coalition evidence always points against the TTB winner and predicts selection of the TTB winner below chance. Nested conditions increase the size of this opposing coalition from one to six lower experts, providing a graded DCSC signature while TTB remains exactly invariant. The two single-supporter conditions also contrast a relatively reliable lower expert (82%) with a weaker one (65%), testing DCSC's compressed reliability weighting without affecting TTB. Each pattern has an exact A/B reversal, controlling response-side preference. The 12 unique pairs are repeated eight times, yielding 96 trials.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — theories that depend on validity order re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) make many candidate theories indistinguishable, so spread them out.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended theories be dissociated; avoid trials where every theory agrees.

  "rationale": "The broad validity profile forces DCSC into its compensatory regime while preserving a unique highest-validity cue. With diagnosticities [0.70, 0.64, 0.58, 0.52, 0.46, 0.40, 0.34, 0.20], the maximum DCSC dominance score is approximately 0.215, below the minimum dominance threshold of 0.285; even at the least decisive allowed gap sensitivity, the dominance gate is below 0.008. In every underlying pattern, Expert 1 discriminates for a designated top-cue winner, so Take The Best always selects that option with the same probability q = epsilon/2 + (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta), regardless of all lower cues. DCSC predicts a distinctive crossover. When only one lower expert opposes Expert 1, the top-cue winner remains weakly favored because its reliability weight is larger. This preference should be stronger when the lone opponent is the weakest expert (Expert 8) rather than Expert 2, directly testing compressed reliability weighting. Once two or more lower experts form the opposing coalition, DCSC predicts the coalition's option above chance, with increasingly strong but diminishing support as the coalition grows from two to three, five, and seven experts. Thus TTB predicts complete invariance, whereas DCSC predicts both a directional crossover between one- and multi-opponent trials and a nonlinear coalition-size gradient. Unlike the previously explored tied-anchor design, the highest-validity anchor is unique here and DCSC initially agrees with TTB before lower-cue accumulation overturns it. Exact A/B reversals control response-side preferences. The 12 unique pairs are repeated eight times, yielding 96 trials.",
