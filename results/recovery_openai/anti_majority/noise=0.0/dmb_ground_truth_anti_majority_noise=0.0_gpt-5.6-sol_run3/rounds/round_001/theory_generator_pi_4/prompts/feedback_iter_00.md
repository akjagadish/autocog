# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Replace pi_3 with a dominance-gated evidence-integration theory. The new theory should propose that people first assess whether the communicated validity profile contains a sufficiently dominant cue. When such a cue is recognized, choices are anchored on it and lower-validity cues exert only weak, approximately order-invariant influence, producing the near invariance in Experiment 1 and no reliable subject-level crossover in Experiment 2. When no cue clears the subject's dominance threshold, signed reliability evidence from multiple discriminating cues is accumulated, with bounded or saturating contributions and possible redundancy discounting; this compensatory mode should allow collections of lower-validity cues to overturn the highest-validity discriminating cue, as required by Experiment 4. Serial position and the final cue should not have intrinsically directional effects: conflict may increase noise, deliberation, or switching between dominance and integration modes, but it should not automatically open a recency gate. Stable subject traits could include the dominance threshold, sensitivity to validity gaps, degree of evidence saturation or redundancy discounting, and response noise. The theory should predict continuous, non-extreme effects and permit heterogeneity rather than hard-coding crossovers throughout the parameter range. It differs from pi_1 by allowing genuine multi-cue compensation and differs from pi_3 by making strategy selection depend on validity dominance and evidence structure rather than obligatory primacy and conflict-triggered recency. Its model should be calibrated jointly to yield an approximately zero Experiment-1 interaction, zero prevalence above the 0.12 Experiment-2 crossover threshold, near-unanimous first-cue agreement in Experiment 3 when dominance conditions support it, and approximately 0.32 highest-cue alignment in Experiment 4.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Dominance-Calibrated Saturating Coalitions (DCSC) proposes that people classify the communicated validity profile before evaluating individual options. A cue whose reliability advantage over the remaining cues exceeds a stable subjective threshold activates a dominance regime. In that regime, the highest-validity cue that discriminates anchors the decision, while the remaining cues provide only a small, order-invariant adjustment. Without sufficient validity dominance, people enter a compensatory regime and accumulate signed reliability evidence from every discriminating cue. Reliability differences are compressed, and repeated support for the same option has diminishing marginal impact, representing perceived redundancy among concordant experts. Thus, several lower-validity cues can collectively defeat the best discriminating cue, but neither early nor late serial position is intrinsically favored. Evidential balance can induce additional deliberation, modeled as a modest increase in choice consistency rather than a directional recency rule. Stable individual differences concern the dominance threshold, sensitivity to validity gaps, compression and saturation of reliability evidence, leakage of coalition evidence into dominance decisions, deliberation under conflict, and response sensitivity.

`rationale`:
DCSC removes the previous model's obligatory primacy and conflict-triggered recency mechanisms. Its dominance gate depends only on the communicated validity profile, while all trial-level coalition computations are permutation-invariant. A clearly separated cue therefore produces stable anchor-following choices and weak lower-cue effects, supporting above-chance first-discriminating-cue agreement without manufacturing subject-level crossovers from cue position. Profiles lacking a decisive gap invoke genuine multi-cue compensation. Strong compression of validity differences lets coalitions of nominally weaker experts matter substantially, while bounded coalition strength prevents unbounded feature-count effects. This provides behavior between pure Take The Best and pure tallying and yields continuous probabilities rather than deterministic strategy labels. In the Experiment-4 design, trials maintain similar coalition sizes across whether Expert 1 agrees with Expert 5; the nearly equal compensatory weights and absence of primacy therefore suppress the measured Expert-1 crossover. In balanced versus imbalanced conflicts, a small nondirectional deliberation effect can produce a modest interaction near the observed Experiment-3 value without privileging the final cue. The narrow but heterogeneous parameter ranges preserve stable individual differences while avoiding hard-coded experimental conditions, feature identities, serial positions, or crossover-producing regimes.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4999 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4999.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is faithful to the prescribed dominance-gated, order-invariant integration family, and it succeeds on Experiment 4: crossover prevalence is exactly 0.0000 with zero variance, correctly eliminating pi_3's obligatory positional crossover. However, the central regime selection is badly calibrated. In Experiment 1, humans are unanimously above chance in following the first/highest-validity discriminating cue (1.0000, variance 0), whereas DCSC produces only 0.1200 with substantial heterogeneity (variance 0.1056). Conversely, in Experiment 2, where compensation should reduce highest-cue alignment to about 0.3242, the candidate remains strongly anchor-aligned at 0.8244. Thus, the model is effectively assigning too much integration to the Experiment-1 profile and too much dominance to the Experiment-2 profile\u2014the reverse of the required regime pattern. Experiment 3 is a smaller miss: the predicted interaction is essentially zero (-0.0004) rather than the observed modest positive 0.0721, although it is much closer than the directional effects of pi_2 and pi_3.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Retain the prescribed mechanism family, but revise the dominance-gate calibration and its profile normalization. The current normalized top-versus-second gap does not discriminate the experimental validity profiles in the required direction. Do not simply increase dominance globally: that might repair Experiment 1 while worsening the already excessive 0.8244 alignment in Experiment 2. Instead, use an in-family profile-sensitive dominance statistic\u2014such as a calibrated combination of absolute top-second separation, the top cue's share relative to the remaining reliability mass, or a different normalization of the validity gap\u2014and set its threshold/slope so Experiment 1 is consistently in the dominance regime while Experiment 2 is predominantly compensatory. The Experiment-1 variance also indicates that the gate is too soft or straddles subjects' thresholds there; once profiles are correctly ordered, tighten the threshold range or steepen the gate to obtain near-unanimous classification. Preserve weak, order-invariant leakage so Experiment 4 remains at zero crossover. After fixing regime selection, modestly tune conflict deliberation or response sensitivity to raise Experiment 3's balanced-minus-imbalanced effect toward +0.07 without adding directional recency."
