# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_6`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_6`).

Replace pi_6 with a new task-invariant theory of configuration-dependent selective integration that competes with ADCG without treating feedback-free exposure as sufficient evidence for learned cue dependence. The theory should combine: (1) communicated-validity weighting; (2) redundancy-discounted coalition accumulation; (3) static minority or dissent distinctiveness that can operate even when the highest-validity cue has allies, allowing singleton dissent to matter in Experiment 2; (4) a sharply nonmonotonic isolated-anchor mechanism in which one or two credible opponents can challenge the anchor but a larger concordant coalition can trigger redundancy-based anchor restoration, as required by Experiment 8; (5) bounded presentation-order influence, including tied-top anchoring, without a general primacy crossover; and (6) stable subject-level mixtures or random effects over validity sensitivity, order use, minority amplification, restoration thresholds, temperature, and lapse to reproduce the observed heterogeneity. History-dependent anti-concurrence should be absent without correctness feedback, or confined to a small optional component that activates only with strong independent evidence and cannot generate the spurious Experiment 9 contrast. The new model should separately predict compact isolated-anchor trials and singleton-dissent trials rather than fitting their pooled Experiment 2 metric through one mechanism. Quantitatively, it should target intermediate anchor following in Experiment 1, low pooled anchor following in Experiment 2, a near-zero diagnostic-learning contrast in Experiment 9, and the large negative one-versus-multiple-opponent contrast in Experiment 8. This preserves SCCI's useful challenge/restoration insight while removing its degenerative restrictions and provides a stronger, more falsifiable competitor to ADCG.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Partitioned Dissent and Redundancy Restoration (PDRR) proposes that people construct a stable, instruction-based evidence representation and classify each choice configuration before integrating its cues. Communicated validities determine cue strength, while cues supporting the same option accumulate sublinearly because concordant reports are treated as partly redundant. In ordinary embedded coalitions, individual cue weights are compressed before accumulation, limiting the influence of any single non-anchor cue while preserving communicated-validity ordering. Two forms of opposition are processed separately. When the highest-validity cue is isolated, a single credible opponent receives especially strong challenge status, while two credible opponents receive a separately calibrated challenge; coalitions of three or more trigger a count-dominant redundancy-restoration branch that does not require every validity-gap test to be passed. When the validity anchor has allies, static distinctiveness is sharply localized to singleton dissent, with its strength increasing with the number of concordant allies it opposes. Presentation order affects choice only as a bounded tie breaker among currently discriminating cues with equal maximal communicated validity, avoiding a general primacy crossover. All mechanisms are history-invariant in this feedback-free task. Stable subject types emphasize compact challenge, count-based restoration, or weak configuration selectivity, with additional random effects over validity sensitivity, redundancy, temperature, and lapse.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal edit of the accepted PDRR candidate. The successful ordinary-coalition compression, credibility calculation, tied-top order gate, softmax, and history invariance are retained. Three localized changes address the remaining failures. First, isolated-anchor challenge is now asymmetric: one credible opponent receives stronger challenge than before, while two opponents have a separate bounded level. This should lower anchor following on the compact trials contributing to Experiments 2, 6, and 10 without treating all opponent counts alike. Second, restoration now has a count-dominant branch centered 0.75 opponents above the existing subject-specific threshold. It becomes strong primarily at three or more opponents and does not multiply the count, validity-gap, and credibility-gap gates, directly targeting the missing negative one-versus-multiple contrast and the deterioration in Experiment 1. The original selective branch is retained but attenuated for exactly two opponents, reducing the modest over-restoration in Experiment 9. Third, the existing singleton channel is strengthened through its already selective logarithmic ally-count term, making singleton dissent against five allies more influential while leaving Experiment 4's two-versus-four configurations outside the gate. A discrete stable configuration type introduces correlated challenge-sensitive, count-restoring, and weakly selective subject profiles, increasing structured heterogeneity without history-dependent learning.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2803 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2859 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1994 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1886 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.1886.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: PDRR is faithful to the prescribed configuration-dependent, history-invariant mechanism family and is an accepted improvement, but it is not yet experiment-invariant. It fits Experiment 5 almost exactly (0.7925 vs. 0.7900), Experiment 8 well (0.0059 vs. 0.0070), and is reasonably close on Experiments 1 and 3. The central challenge/restoration predictions, however, remain substantially miscalibrated. Anchor following is too high in Experiment 2 (0.5373 vs. 0.3242), while the one-versus-multiple contrast in Experiment 6 is far too weak (-0.0944 vs. -0.5450). Conversely, two-opponent isolated-anchor adherence is much too low in Experiment 9 (0.3887 vs. 0.7250). Thus, opponent count alone is not separating challenge from restoration correctly across configurations. Experiment 4 also shows a large spurious crossover prevalence (0.6000 vs. 0), despite the explicit order gate being inactive there; this crossover must therefore be induced indirectly by the broad count-based minority amplification and validity-weighted coalition composition. Experiment 7 is history-invariant as required, but still produces a non-null static diagnostic-control contrast (-0.0899 vs. 0.0052), so omitting learning is necessary but not sufficient. Experiment 10 is moderately too anti-anchor (0.3488 vs. 0.4462). Between-subject variance is also too low in several critical experiments, especially Experiments 2, 6, 9, and 10.
Rationale: Keep PDRR's mechanism family, but recalibrate how configuration gates challenge, dissent, and restoration. First, the compact challenge should not be a function of opponent count alone. Gate its amplitude by the opponents' combined communicated reliability relative to the anchor. This can distinguish the credible compact opposition requiring low adherence in Experiments 2 and 10 from the weaker two-cue coalition in Experiment 9, where adherence must rise toward 0.725. Second, make the challenge peak more concentrated at one opponent and lower the restoration threshold so that multi-opponent trials restore the anchor much more strongly. That joint change should both lower one-opponent adherence in Experiment 6 and raise multi-opponent adherence, producing the required large negative contrast rather than merely shifting all isolated-anchor trials together. Third, replace the broad embedded-dissent multiplier applied whenever the anchor side is numerically larger with a sharply singleton-localized, bounded distinctiveness gate based on support ratio as well as count. The current general imbalance amplification creates the severe Experiment 4 crossover even without an explicit primacy term. Preserve strong singleton effects where needed for Experiment 2, but suppress amplification for ordinary two-versus-four and similar coalitions. Fourth, tune this singleton gate so that the matched diagnostic and control configurations in Experiment 7 have nearly equal static anchor adherence; the current -0.09 contrast is a configuration artifact, not learning. Finally, widen stable subject-level random effects for challenge strength, restoration threshold, singleton amplification, temperature, and lapse, since the critical simulated variances are systematically below the observed heterogeneity. Do not add history dependence or broaden the order mechanism: the tied-top order fit in Experiment 5 is already excellent, and the Experiment 4 failure originates elsewhere.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2803 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2859 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed history-invariant, configuration-dependent selective-integration family, but the current revision was rejected by the loss gate and should not replace the accepted iteration-1 base. It successfully repaired Experiment 9 (0.7444 vs. 0.7250) and modestly strengthened the Experiment 6 contrast, but these gains came from a global challenge/restoration recalibration that substantially worsened Experiment 2 (0.5833 vs. 0.3242), Experiment 10 (0.6813 vs. 0.4462), Experiment 3 (0.0063 vs. 0.0721), and Experiment 5 (0.7473 vs. 0.7900). The key dissociation is now especially clear: the two-opponent coalition in Experiment 9 should preserve anchor following, whereas compact opposition in Experiment 10 should challenge it. Redundancy-discounted total support does not distinguish these cases adequately. Experiment 6 still has far too little challenge/restoration separation (-0.1503 vs. -0.5450), and Experiment 4 retains a severe spurious crossover prevalence (0.5000 vs. 0), even though its configurations do not activate the new singleton gate. That implicates ordinary validity-weighted coalition composition, rather than minority amplification alone. Experiment 7 also remains spuriously negative (-0.0942 vs. 0.0052). Fits to Experiments 1, 8, and 9 are good, but the pattern is not experiment-invariant.
Rationale: Because the previous recommendation's global lowering/sharpening of restoration and support-ratio gating was rejected, do not repeat or intensify those shifts. Build from the unchanged accepted iteration-1 base and use a more selective in-family factorization. For isolated-anchor trials, distinguish coalitions using the reliability of the strongest and second-strongest individual opponents, or an opponent-reliability dispersion statistic, rather than only their redundancy-discounted summed support. Couple restoration to a two-dimensional count-by-validity-gap gate: multi-opponent coalitions with a clearly superior anchor should restore strongly, as in Experiments 6 and 9, while two individually credible opponents with a small anchor gap should retain challenge, as in Experiment 10. Keep compact challenge and embedded singleton dissent on separately parameterized channels so lowering pooled anchor following in Experiment 2 does not globally suppress anchor following in Experiment 9 or 10.

Separately address Experiment 4 at the ordinary-coalition accumulator. Since the singleton gate is inactive there, bound the marginal influence of any one non-anchor cue or normalize non-anchor weights within each coalition before count discounting. This should make swapping Expert 1's alignment less capable of producing a subject-level crossover while preserving communicated-validity weighting and the tied-top order mechanism. Apply this compression only to embedded ordinary coalitions, not isolated-anchor trials. Re-establish the accepted base's tied-top parameters, which already fit Experiment 5 almost exactly, rather than changing order-related ranges. Finally, tune stable mixture weights rather than simply widening all parameter ranges: include challenge-sensitive, gap-restoring, and weakly configuration-sensitive subject types so the variances in Experiments 6, 9, and 10 can increase without moving all means together. Keep history dependence absent.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2859 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1994 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision is a meaningful improvement and remains faithful to the prescribed configuration-dependent, history-invariant PDRR family. The previously recommended selective factorization helped: Experiment 3 is now nearly exact (0.0779 vs. 0.0721), the spurious Experiment 4 crossover fell sharply from 0.6000 to 0.1200, Experiment 7 moved toward zero (-0.0333 vs. 0.0052), and the tied-top order effect remains excellent in Experiment 5 (0.7977 vs. 0.7900). Experiments 8 and 9 are also reasonably close in mean. Nevertheless, the central challenge/restoration signature still fails. Experiment 6 has the wrong sign and a very large error: the candidate predicts greater anchor adherence with one opponent than with multiple opponents (0.0741), whereas humans show a large negative contrast (-0.5450). Experiment 2 also remains much too anchor-following (0.5813 vs. 0.3242), and Experiment 10 is too anchor-following (0.5725 vs. 0.4462). Thus, credible compact opposition and singleton dissent remain too weak, while count-based restoration is not reliably dominating for larger coalitions. Experiment 9 is somewhat over-restored (0.8075 vs. 0.7250). The critical between-subject variances are also compressed, especially in Experiments 2, 6, 9, and 10. Experiment 1 has deteriorated to 0.9000 versus unanimous observed prevalence, likely because some large-coalition profiles are not entering restoration consistently.
Rationale: Continue from this accepted candidate and preserve the successful ordinary-coalition compression and tied-top order settings; the previous advice in that direction was accepted and substantially repaired Experiments 3, 4, and 7. The next revision should target the isolated-anchor gates rather than globally changing integration. First, inspect and recalibrate the conjunction of the three restoration gates. Multiplying count, validity-gap, and credibility-gap sigmoids appears to suppress restoration too often in Experiment 6, even for large coalitions. Add a count-dominant restoration branch for clearly large coalitions, such as count at least three, that is bounded but does not require all gap gates to be simultaneously near one. This should raise multi-opponent anchor adherence and recover the negative Experiment 6 contrast while also protecting Experiment 1. Do not globally lower the restoration threshold, since that earlier broad strategy was rejected and would further overfit Experiment 9. Second, make compact challenge asymmetric across counts rather than using the current profile centered symmetrically at 1.5: allow especially strong one-opponent challenge, with a separately calibrated two-opponent challenge controlled tightly by individual opponent credibility. Stronger challenge for genuinely near-anchor opponents should lower adherence in Experiment 10 and relevant compact trials in Experiment 2 without undoing weak-opponent restoration in Experiment 9. Third, strengthen or broaden the embedded singleton-dissent channel selectively for the Experiment 2 configurations; its current bounded multiplier is insufficient to produce the observed pooled rate. Use a support-ratio or dissent-validity gate so this adjustment does not revive the Experiment 4 crossover. Finally, implement genuinely stable mixture components or correlated random effects—challenge-sensitive, count-restoring, and weakly selective types—rather than only independent narrow parameter draws. This is needed to increase variance in Experiments 6 and 9 while allowing some subjects to challenge strongly enough in Experiments 2 and 10. Keep history dependence absent and retain the current bounded tied-top order mechanism.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1994 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1886 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "The accepted revision is a further aggregate improvement and remains faithful to the prescribed history-invariant, configuration-dependent selective-integration family. The count-dominant restoration branch moved Experiment 6 in the correct direction, from +0.0741 to -0.2309, and restored Experiment 1 from 0.9000 to 0.9800. The asymmetric challenge also improved Experiment 10 from 0.5725 to 0.5288. These gains confirm that the most recent, accepted advice identified useful in-family controls. Fits are good for Experiments 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Nevertheless, the model is not yet experiment-invariant. Experiment 2 remains the largest qualitative failure: anchor following is 0.5787 versus 0.3242, barely changed despite stronger compact and singleton mechanisms. Experiment 6 still expresses less than half of the observed challenge/restoration separation (-0.2309 versus -0.5450). Experiment 9 is now over-restored (0.8219 versus 0.7250), while Experiment 10 remains too anchor-following (0.5288 versus 0.4462). Experiment 4 also retains a nonzero spurious crossover prevalence (0.1800 versus 0), although it is much better than early iterations. Finally, stable subject heterogeneity is still much too weak in the critical configurations: variances are 0.0041 versus 0.0174 in Experiment 2, 0.0132 versus 0.0462 in Experiment 6, 0.0096 versus 0.0723 in Experiment 9, and 0.0041 versus 0.0224 in Experiment 10.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Continue from this accepted candidate and preserve the successful ordinary-coalition compression, history invariance, and tied-top order mechanism. Extend the accepted count-restoration adjustment rather than reversing it: make the count-dominant gate closer to zero for exactly two opponents but steeper and nearer its ceiling for three or more. Also attenuate the selective restoration branch more strongly at exactly two opponents. This should lower the over-restored Experiment 9 value while raising multi-opponent adherence in Experiment 6, increasing the required negative contrast without globally lowering the restoration threshold\u2014a broad move that was previously rejected.\n\nThe persistent Experiment 2 failure now requires condition-level calibration rather than another pooled global shift. Report or internally target its compact isolated-anchor and embedded-dissent trial classes separately. Increase challenge selectively for a single credible opponent, and increase two-opponent challenge only when both opponents are individually near the anchor in communicated validity. A modestly sharper credibility-gap gate paired with greater challenge amplitude can lower the credible compact conditions in Experiments 2 and 10 while sparing the weaker two-opponent coalition in Experiment 9. Strengthen embedded singleton dissent only where the dissenter is sufficiently credible relative to the anchor coalition; do not broaden it to ordinary two-versus-four profiles, given the remaining Experiment 4 crossover.\n\nFor Experiment 4, tighten the existing ordinary-coalition compression slightly or cap the marginal contribution of the strongest non-anchor cue, rather than changing order use or the isolated-anchor branches. Finally, increase separation among the stable configuration types specifically in one- and two-opponent challenge strength and restoration thresholds, and adjust their mixture weights. The current type gains do not produce the observed heterogeneity. Avoid merely widening all independent ranges, which could damage the near-unanimous Experiment 1 pattern. These are localized calibrations within PDRR, not a change of mechanism family."
