# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_6" and "pi_5") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_6
Static Configuration-Contingent Integration (SCCI) claims that people form a fixed, instruction-based representation of cue reliability and apply it to the directional evidence profile on each trial. Each discriminating cue contributes reliability-weighted evidence, so independently supporting cues accumulate, while concordant cues are compressed as potentially redundant. This compression increases moderately convexly with coalition size, reflecting the declining informational value of each additional concordant cue. A bounded configuration gate supplements integration: strong protection of a uniquely most-valid cue is restricted to profiles in which that cue is isolated, has a sufficiently large communicated-validity advantage, and faces multiple concordant opponents. Cue uniqueness functions primarily as a tie detector, while a separate raw validity-gap criterion determines whether restoration is warranted. The transition to restoration is sharp, allowing an isolated anchor to be weak against one credible challenger but strongly protected against a redundant multi-cue bloc. Compact challenge amplification is strictly limited to isolated anchors and therefore cannot create general primacy effects when the anchor has allies. When the most-valid discriminating cues have equal communicated validity, they remain exchangeable in the integrator, but stable display order supplies a bounded tie-breaking anchor. Choices are history-invariant because concurrence, anti-concurrence, and discrimination frequency are not learned without correctness feedback. Stable profile heterogeneity arises from subject-level variation in validity sensitivity, coalition integration, redundancy, isolated-anchor challenge and restoration, tie-order bias, temperature, and lapse.

## THEORY 2 — pi_5
Adaptive Distinctive Coalition Gating (ADCG) proposes that binary-feature decisions arise from task-adaptive cue weights combining communicated validity, presentation prominence, distributional rarity, and learned cue dependence. Directionally concordant cues are compressed as potentially redundant, while sparse dissent can dominate when its cues have reliably and repeatedly opposed the anchor's cues. Learned anti-concurrence is reliability-sensitive: disagreement near chance is strongly suppressed, whereas well-observed disagreement above a subject-specific threshold receives a bounded nonlinear gain. A profile-driven gate interpolates between coalition comparison and a lexicographic anchor, preserving anchoring against large redundant coalitions while permitting diagnostic opposition to suppress it. For compact opposition, gate suppression is controlled by a selective summary of the strongest reliably learned opposing relationship rather than an indiscriminate average across all cue pairs; larger coalitions retain mean aggregation and strong size decay. In addition, a unique, early-presented validity anchor loses accessibility within the coalition core when it faces compact, reliably anti-concurrent opposition. This attenuation targets residual anchoring without increasing dissent support and vanishes for tied-validity anchors, late anchors, and large opposing coalitions. When top validities are tied, presentation order supplies a bounded anchor but the distinctive-coalition core is attenuated by a stable subject-specific amount. Stable variation in validity attention, order prominence, anti-concurrence threshold and gain, diagnostic selectivity, anchor attenuation, tied-top attenuation, redundancy, gating, and temperature produces structured individual differences without experiment-specific strategies.

**Rationale:** This design isolates ADCG's learned within-coalition dependence while SCCI remains history-invariant. Expert 5 is the unique 95%-valid anchor. Experts 1–4 all have validity 72%, arranged as an outer pair (Experts 1 and 4) and a middle pair (Experts 2 and 3). Across the four history-building patterns and their A/B reversals, Experts 1 and 4 always discriminate concordantly, whereas Experts 2 and 3 always discriminate in opposite directions. Each lower expert nevertheless concurs with the anchor on half of these patterns and opposes it on half, equating lower-cue validity, discrimination frequency, and relationships with the anchor. The two critical targets are configuration-matched: the anchor supports one product while either the outer pair or the middle pair unanimously supports the other; the unused pair is nondiscriminating. SCCI assigns identical evidence to these targets because both contain one isolated 95% anchor against two 72% opponents. Its large validity gap activates isolated-anchor restoration, and it predicts the same stable, above-chance preference for the anchor's product in both targets at every point in the experiment. ADCG instead learns that the outer pair is highly concurrent and therefore redundant, while the middle pair is usually anti-concurrent and receives little historical redundancy discount when it happens to agree on its target. Relationships between each target cue and the anchor remain approximately 60% opposing—below ADCG's anti-concurrence thresholds—and are matched across pairs, so the key difference is coalition dependence rather than diagnostic dissent. Distributional rarity is also matched: every lower expert discriminates on five of the six underlying patterns. Presentation positions are deliberately balanced in summed prominence (outer positions 1 and 4 versus middle positions 2 and 3); convex order weighting may make the outer coalition slightly stronger initially, but learned redundancy should decisively reverse that contrast. Thus ADCG predicts an experience-dependent increase in P(anchor choice | outer-pair target) relative to P(anchor choice | middle-pair target), potentially with the middle coalition defeating the anchor late in the block. SCCI predicts an exactly zero target contrast and zero experience interaction. Because the first active cue on either target belongs to the two-cue opposing coalition rather than the late anchor, ADCG's minority-first profile gate is closed, exposing the coalition-learning effect in its core comparison. Exact A/B reversals control response-side preference. The 12 unique pairs are repeated eight times, yielding 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric measures the overall probability of following the uniquely 95%-valid expert when it is isolated against either concordant pair of 72%-valid experts. Unlike the failed outer-minus-middle contrast, it retains the large common level difference predicted for both target classes and pools 32 balanced target observations per subject. SCCI's sharp isolated-anchor restoration gate should produce a consistently high anchor-choice rate on every repetition. ADCG's minority-first gate is closed on these profiles because the earliest active cue belongs to the two-cue opposition; its choices therefore depend primarily on coalition comparison, including dissent amplification and comparatively weak or absent protection of the anchor. Pooling outer and middle targets reduces binomial and subject-level variability, while exact A/B reversals balance response-side bias.

**Rationale:** This design isolates ADCG's selective use of the strongest reliably learned opposing relationship in a compact two-cue coalition, together with diagnostic dissent gain and attenuation of an early unique anchor. Expert 1 is the unique 95%-valid anchor and discriminates on every trial. Experts 2, 3, 5, and 6 all have validity 72% and each discriminates in exactly five of the six underlying patterns, equating their advertised reliability and asymptotic rarity. The first two patterns are the critical targets. In the diagnostic target, Experts 3 and 5 oppose the anchor; in the control target, Experts 2 and 6 oppose it. Both targets therefore present exactly one 95% anchor against two 72% opponents. SCCI assigns them identical evidence and predicts an exactly zero target difference at every experience level because it ignores presentation position and history, and its isolated-anchor restoration depends only on the shared validity gap and coalition counts. Across the four history-building patterns, Expert 3 always opposes Expert 1, so their anti-concurrence approaches its reliable, above-threshold regime. Each of Experts 2, 5, and 6 instead opposes Expert 1 on only two of four builders; including its target occurrence, each has three oppositions and two concurrences with the anchor, leaving its smoothed anti-concurrence below ADCG's threshold. On the diagnostic target, ADCG's reliability-weighted selective maximum can consequently detect the strong Expert-3 relationship without diluting it by Expert 5's weak relationship. This suppresses the profile gate protecting the isolated early anchor, amplifies Expert 3's dissent, and attenuates Expert 1 in the coalition core. Neither control opponent receives these learned effects. Historical concurrence within the two target coalitions is matched: Experts 3 and 5 concur on three of their five joint observations, as do Experts 2 and 6. Thus learned within-coalition redundancy cannot explain the critical contrast. The main quantitative prediction is an experience-dependent decrease in anchor choices on the diagnostic target relative to the control target: the late-minus-early change in [P(anchor choice | diagnostic) - P(anchor choice | control)] should be negative under ADCG but exactly zero under SCCI. Any initial serial-position difference can be estimated in the early trials rather than mistaken for learning; the opposing pairs also have matched summed prominence. Exact A/B reversals preserve every cue relationship while controlling response-side bias. The 12 unique pairs are repeated eight times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric measures overall following of the 95%-valid anchor on the two profiles where Expert 3 supplies the design's most diagnostic opposition. It combines the compact diagnostic target with the builder profile in which Expert 3 is the sole dissenter against the other five cues, including the anchor. ADCG should produce relatively low anchor following: learned anti-concurrence disengages anchor protection on the compact profile, while distinctive-coalition amplification gives the singleton dissenter substantial influence on the second profile. SCCI instead strongly protects the isolated anchor on the compact profile and, on the singleton profile, statically accumulates the five-cue anchor coalition without singleton amplification because the anchor is not isolated. Pooling both A/B reversals and all eight repetitions yields 32 observations per subject, substantially reducing binary sampling variance relative to a late-only difference score.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.

  "interpretation": "Across all ten experiments, pi_5 (ADCG) is decisively better overall. Its mean absolute point-estimate error is approximately 0.039, compared with 0.134 for pi_6. ADCG is essentially exact in Experiments 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10; it is also substantially closer in Experiments 4 and 5. Particularly diagnostic are Experiment 2 (observed 0.4462; pi_5 0.4656; pi_6 0.7306) and Experiment 8 (observed -0.5450; pi_5 -0.5416; pi_6 -0.1356). These show that SCCI's static coalition calculation and isolated-anchor restoration do not provide enough configuration sensitivity: SCCI overprotects the anchor in Experiment 2 yet produces far too little of the strong reversal between one- and multi-opponent profiles in Experiment 8. Its restrictions against general minority amplification also make the low anchor-following component of Experiment 2 structurally difficult to capture. ADCG additionally captures the low highest-validity-cue adherence in Experiment 4, the positive interaction in Experiment 5, and the absence of a primacy crossover in Experiment 6. SCCI's genuine successes should nevertheless be retained as constraints. It is closer in Experiment 1 (0.8094 versus an observed 0.7250, compared with ADCG's 0.5687), Experiment 7, and especially Experiment 9, where its near-zero diagnostic-control contrast matches the observed null while ADCG predicts -0.1060. Experiment 9 is important evidence against making unsupervised anti-concurrence learning the general explanation of ADCG's successes. Moreover, the aggregate metric in Experiment 2 pools compact opposition with a very different singleton-dissent profile, so its agreement with ADCG does not uniquely identify learning. A static configuration mechanism could produce the same pooled level. The observed between-subject variances are also generally larger than either simulation predicts, most conspicuously in Experiments 1 and 2, indicating missing stable heterogeneity. Thus ADCG wins empirically, but its central history-learning interpretation is not task-invariant, while SCCI has structural rather than merely parametric failures. Regenerating SCCI's parameter ranges would not repair those failures without contradicting its prose restrictions.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_6 with a new task-invariant theory of configuration-dependent selective integration that competes with ADCG without treating feedback-free exposure as sufficient evidence for learned cue dependence. The theory should combine: (1) communicated-validity weighting; (2) redundancy-discounted coalition accumulation; (3) static minority or dissent distinctiveness that can operate even when the highest-validity cue has allies, allowing singleton dissent to matter in Experiment 2; (4) a sharply nonmonotonic isolated-anchor mechanism in which one or two credible opponents can challenge the anchor but a larger concordant coalition can trigger redundancy-based anchor restoration, as required by Experiment 8; (5) bounded presentation-order influence, including tied-top anchoring, without a general primacy crossover; and (6) stable subject-level mixtures or random effects over validity sensitivity, order use, minority amplification, restoration thresholds, temperature, and lapse to reproduce the observed heterogeneity. History-dependent anti-concurrence should be absent without correctness feedback, or confined to a small optional component that activates only with strong independent evidence and cannot generate the spurious Experiment 9 contrast. The new model should separately predict compact isolated-anchor trials and singleton-dissent trials rather than fitting their pooled Experiment 2 metric through one mechanism. Quantitatively, it should target intermediate anchor following in Experiment 1, low pooled anchor following in Experiment 2, a near-zero diagnostic-learning contrast in Experiment 9, and the large negative one-versus-multiple-opponent contrast in Experiment 8. This preserves SCCI's useful challenge/restoration insight while removing its degenerative restrictions and provides a stronger, more falsifiable competitor to ADCG."
