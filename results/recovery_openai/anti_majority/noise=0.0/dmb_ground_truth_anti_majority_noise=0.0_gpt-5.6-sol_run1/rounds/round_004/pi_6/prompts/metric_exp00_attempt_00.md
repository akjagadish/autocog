# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** This design translates a fixed two-cue competitive cluster across a 32-expert display while holding its size, within-cluster spacing, validity, recommendation, and opposing evidence constant. In each base pair, exactly two adjacent 82%-valid experts favor A, and the isolated 55%-valid Expert 16 favors B. The six A-cluster locations are positions 1–2, 7–8, 13–14, 19–20, 25–26, and 31–32. The 95%-valid Expert 4 always ties. Take The Best therefore skips the tied 95% expert and stops at the first active 82% expert, predicting the same A-choice probability q=(1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta)+epsilon/2 in every condition. The Competitive Source-Binding Cascade predicts a different quantitative profile. Because the two A cues are adjacent, equally valid, and recommend the same option, their mutual competitive crowding is identical across conditions; because their moderate validity lies near the model's binding-uncertainty region, failed retrieval should frequently permit the fixed, isolated B cue to control choice. Translating the cluster later selectively increases its binding support through the 32-cue long-display positional contrast, with an additional sharply localized recency benefit for the terminal cluster. Thus the model predicts increasing A choices from early to late cluster locations, typically with the largest improvement at positions 31–32 and potentially a crossover from following B to following A. This isolates serial-position recovery from cluster density, unlike a spacing manipulation: all competitive relationships within the cluster remain unchanged. The final six pairs are exact A/B reversals, balancing response-side preferences while preserving the predicted location gradient. Twelve unique pairs repeated eight times yield 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Competitive Source-Binding Cascade. Communicated validities establish an ordinal, usually lexicographic cue hierarchy, but successful use of a cue requires binding its validity label, display identity, and current recommendation into one retrievable representation. Binding fidelity is determined jointly rather than by independent cue accessibility. In particular, nearby discriminating cues with similar compressed validities and the same recommendation form a competitive cluster. Members of such a cluster mutually inhibit one another and can become collectively difficult to identify, so adding redundant support can reduce rather than increase use of the highest-validity cue. When the leading cue is not retrieved, search falls through the validity hierarchy, often allowing isolated, salient opposing cues to control choice. Validities are represented nonlinearly, with moderately diagnostic labels especially vulnerable to source-binding uncertainty. Display position contributes modest primacy and a terminally localized recency boost but no obligatory late-position cost. Thus, pure terminal position can be beneficial while dense terminal redundancy remains harmful because competition overwhelms recency. In unusually long displays, memory load additionally produces a zero-mean early-to-late binding contrast: early sources receive modest interference while late sources retain greater temporal distinctiveness. Stable individual differences govern validity compression, the location and width of maximal binding uncertainty, competitive interference, serial-position biases, long-display positional contrast, and response reversal.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This is the terminal-cluster recovery contrast: the rate of choosing the option supported by the adjacent 82%-valid cue pair at positions 31\u201332 minus the corresponding rate pooled across positions 1\u20132 through 25\u201326. Scoring choices relative to the cluster, rather than as raw A choices, combines the exact A/B reversals and removes response-side preference. Pooling all five nonterminal locations provides 80 comparison trials per subject while retaining 16 terminal trials, reducing sampling variance. Take The Best predicts the same cluster-following probability at every location, so its expected contrast is zero for every parameter setting. The Competitive Source-Binding Cascade predicts a sizable positive contrast because the terminal pair receives both the long-display positional advantage and the sharply localized recency boost. This is a substantive behavioral interaction with display position rather than a direct restatement of an internal model quantity."
