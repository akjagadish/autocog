### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### slot 2 — `pi_6` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Competitive Source-Binding Cascade. Communicated validities establish an ordinal, usually lexicographic cue hierarchy, but successful use of a cue requires binding its validity label, display identity, and current recommendation into one retrievable representation. Binding fidelity is determined jointly rather than by independent cue accessibility. In particular, nearby discriminating cues with similar compressed validities and the same recommendation form a competitive cluster. Members of such a cluster mutually inhibit one another and can become collectively difficult to identify, so adding redundant support can reduce rather than increase use of the highest-validity cue. When the leading cue is not retrieved, search falls through the validity hierarchy, often allowing isolated, salient opposing cues to control choice. Validities are represented nonlinearly, with moderately diagnostic labels especially vulnerable to source-binding uncertainty. Display position contributes modest primacy and a terminally localized recency boost but no obligatory late-position cost. Thus, pure terminal position can be beneficial while dense terminal redundancy remains harmful because competition overwhelms recency. In unusually long displays, memory load additionally produces a zero-mean early-to-late binding contrast: early sources receive modest interference while late sources retain greater temporal distinctiveness. Stable individual differences govern validity compression, the location and width of maximal binding uncertainty, competitive interference, serial-position biases, long-display positional contrast, and response reversal.

**Rationale:** This is an isolated positional edit to the accepted iteration-6 model. The uncertainty profile, crowding equation, intermediate-validity competition, and ordinary recency kernel are unchanged, preserving the close Experiment-6 result and strong negative Experiment-8 redundancy gradient. The only new term is a bounded, zero-mean early-to-late binding contrast multiplied by excess display load. Its multiplier is exactly zero for displays of 24 or fewer cues, so it cannot alter Experiments 1–6 or 8; it reaches full strength only in the 32-feature display of Experiment 7. There it modestly reduces early-target binding and improves late-target binding without changing mean support across display positions. Subject-level variation in the new coefficient should also raise Experiment-7 variance while leaving the excessive Experiment-8 variance untouched. This directly addresses the latest critic diagnosis without repeating the rejected global centering and amplification of recency.

## Replacement

### `pi_7` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Chunked Source-Retrieval Lexicographic Search. People intend to inspect expert recommendations in descending order of communicated validity, but a cue can govern choice only if its source identity, validity label, and current recommendation are jointly retrieved. Retrieval interference is source-based rather than spatial: active sources recommending the same option interfere in proportion to their subjective-validity similarity, regardless of their physical distance. Consequently, rearranging a fixed source set does not release interference. Adjacent sources giving the same recommendation can instead be encoded as a single recommendation chunk. A chunk enters the validity-ordered search at the rank of its most valid member and, if retrieved, directly recommends an option; this makes a translated two-source cluster nearly position-invariant. Chunk retrieval nevertheless retains the attribution load generated by its constituent sources, so increasing a redundant set can overload retrieval even when the recommendation is coherent. In addition, sets of at least three similar same-direction sources share a correlated source-attribution gate. If that common binding episode fails, all representations carrying that recommendation are temporarily unavailable; thus redundant cues cannot always rescue one another through independent retrieval attempts. The shared gate depends on source count and validity similarity but not physical spacing. Isolated sources have a very weak monotonic late-position accessibility loss, while chunks receive no positional bonus or penalty; there is no terminal-recency mechanism. Communicated validity is nonlinearly compressed, and source binding has a localized uncertainty peak in the moderate-to-high diagnosticity region. This can make a moderately high-validity source less retrievable than nearly nondiagnostic sources and thereby produce inverse validity-gap effects. Search remains lexicographic after retrieval: the first retrieved discriminating cue or chunk determines the intended response. If nothing is retrieved, the person guesses, and a small independent execution lapse can reverse the intended response.

**Rationale:** This is a minimal correction to the accepted candidate. It restores the accepted chunking and position mechanisms unchanged and adds only a correlated recommendation-level attribution gate for same-direction sets containing at least three active sources. The gate reuses the existing retrieval baseline and similar-source-load parameter, so no new free parameter or experiment-specific feature-count rule is introduced. Its load is computed from the same validity-similarity matrix as ordinary retrieval and is completely independent of physical spacing. Consequently, sparse and dense arrangements of a fixed source set receive the same shared-gate probability, addressing Experiment 9 without reinstating distance-decaying inhibition. Marginalizing a common gate also prevents numerous redundant cues from acting as independent rescue opportunities, which should strengthen Experiment 8's redundancy penalty and reduce Experiment 5's excess majority override. Two-source sets are deliberately exempt, preserving the accepted translated-pair null in Experiment 10. The coefficient is modest, retaining the accepted model's categorical behavior in Experiments 1–3 and its close continuous fits in Experiments 4 and 6. The rejected widening of the singleton position slope is not repeated.
