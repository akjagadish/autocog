# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** This 18-expert factorial design crosses the length of a fixed contiguous high-validity recommendation (three, four, or six 94%-valid experts favoring the run-supported option) with whether its lower-validity opponent has one supporter (70%) or two separated supporters (70% and 60%). The tied 98% expert broadens the advertised-validity range without entering either recommendation. Competition-Normalized Recommendation Race predicts a qualitative interaction. Against the singleton opponent, the competition gate is exactly closed, so increasing the run from three to six sources produces essentially no loss; the only count effect is a negligible saturating gain. Against the two-source opponent, the gate opens. The length-three run remains unpenalized, the length-four run loses approximately 0.63–1.01 retrieval logits, and the length-six run loses approximately 1.90–3.03 logits. It therefore predicts a flat run-length profile with one opponent supporter but a steep, nonlinear decline in choices for the run-supported option with two opponent supporters. Validity-Gated Intrinsic Recommendation Capacity predicts a different quantitative pattern: the 94%-indexed recommendation pays its own smoothly increasing concentration cost regardless of opponent count. From length three to length six, that cost increases by approximately 1.42–2.43 logits across its parameter range. Because the added opponent has only 60% validity and the opponent representation is indexed by 70%, its high-diagnosticity capacity gate is essentially zero; adding it changes accessibility only negligibly. Thus the competing theory predicts similarly steep, approximately parallel run-length declines in both opponent-count strata, not the advocated theory's run-length-by-opponent-count interaction. The final six pairs are exact A/B reversals, balancing response side while preserving the probability of choosing the run-supported recommendation. Twelve unique pairs repeated eight times yield 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Competition-Normalized Recommendation Race. People first compress all currently active experts favoring the same option into a single recommendation-level representation. Consequently, redundant experts are retrieved correlatively rather than as independent opportunities for rescue, and reliability gains from additional experts saturate almost immediately. Each recommendation is indexed by its strongest communicated validity and the two opposing recommendation representations compete for retrieval before a validity-ordered, predominantly lexicographic decision. Source-to-validity binding has a localized nonlinear uncertainty region, allowing moderate-to-high validity cues to be less accessible than cues outside that region. Spatial arrangement ordinarily has no effect. The exception is density overload: a recommendation loses binding fidelity when most of its support forms an extended contiguous run and the opposing recommendation itself has multiple active supporters. This competition gate prevents long runs from being penalized merely for containing many sources and leaves adjacent pairs, separated redundancy, and long runs facing a singleton largely unaffected. The strongest member's location within a run provides no protection. In long displays only, an isolated recommendation receives a weak monotonic accessibility loss with later position; there is no terminal-recency process. Failure to retrieve either recommendation produces guessing, followed by a small symmetric response lapse.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Validity-Gated Intrinsic Recommendation Capacity. On each trial, all active experts favoring the same option are obligatorily compressed into one recommendation representation, irrespective of adjacency, spacing, pairing, or the location of the strongest source. The representation is indexed and ranked by its strongest communicated validity. Additional supporters yield only a negligible, rapidly saturating reliability increment rather than independent retrieval opportunities. Retrieval is limited by the intrinsic representational concentration of each recommendation: jointly binding many same-direction sources becomes costly only at very high diagnosticity, with load increasing smoothly with its own source count. This capacity cost belongs to that recommendation and is never gated by how many sources support its opponent. Thus an opponent acquiring separated supporters cannot suddenly impair an unchanged run. Retrieval also contains a narrow localized nonlinear source-validity binding uncertainty. Retrieved recommendations enter a predominantly lexicographic race ordered by their strongest communicated validity, with accessibility normalized against the competing recommendation. Spatial organization ordinarily has no role. Only an isolated recommendation in a very long display receives a monotonic late-position accessibility gradient, gated so that it is appreciable around 32 features but negligible around 24. If neither recommendation is retrieved, the decision maker guesses; a small symmetric response lapse follows.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This is the within-subject opponent-count effect at the maximally diagnostic run length. Competition-Normalized Recommendation Race predicts that a six-source contiguous run is largely unpenalized against a singleton, but incurs a large density-overload cost when the opponent has two supporters. It therefore predicts a sizable positive difference. The competing theory assigns the six-source recommendation essentially the same intrinsic capacity cost in both conditions, so it predicts a difference near zero. Restricting the metric to the six-source trials avoids diluting the contrast with the theoretically null three-source cells, while coding choices relative to the run-supported option combines exact A/B reversals and cancels response-side tendencies. Each subject contributes 16 trials to each term, yielding a stable within-subject contrast."
