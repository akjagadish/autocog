## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.84, 0.74, 0.66, 0.6, 0.57]

**Trial pairs (n=12):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 2: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 6: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 9: A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  trial 11: A=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  trial 12: A=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

**Rationale:** This design isolates a quantitative confidence dissociation between the two cascade theories. The six base pairs place the first discriminating expert at validity ranks 1 through 6; their exact A/B reversals balance response side. Take The Best assigns the same binary winner score on every pair, so it predicts one rank-invariant probability of following the first discriminating cue: q=(1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta)+epsilon/2. In contrast, every advertised validity is guaranteed to exceed the competing theory's confidence threshold throughout its parameter range: even the weakest expert has minimum subjective confidence 0.75*log(0.57/0.43)=0.211, above the maximum threshold of 0.20. Consequently, Confidence-Capped Cascade Integration also stops at the first discriminating cue, but its evidence magnitude equals sensitivity times that cue's log odds. It therefore predicts a strictly decreasing choice probability as the first discrimination moves from the 95% expert to the 57% expert: p_r=(1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta*sensitivity*log(v_r/(1-v_r)))+epsilon/2. Thus, direction of choice is matched across theories while the predicted rank-by-confidence gradient is present only under the competing theory. Lower-ranked ratings alternate in direction where possible, preventing most displays from being simple unanimous dominance while remaining irrelevant after stopping. The 12 unique pairs are each repeated eight times, yielding exactly 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Confidence-Capped Cascade Integration proposes that people translate each communicated cue validity into an absolute diagnosticity signal and inspect cues from most to least valid. A discriminating cue controls the decision immediately when its diagnosticity exceeds a subject-specific confidence threshold. Earlier weak cues do not force premature stopping: search continues until a sufficiently diagnostic cue is encountered. If no discriminating cue reaches threshold, the decision maker switches to compensatory integration, summing all discriminating cues with weights determined by their stated validities. Thus, the theory produces one-cue dominance when reliable cues are available but graded multi-cue sensitivity when every cue is weak. Subject heterogeneity arises from differences in confidence threshold, sensitivity to stated validity, integration weighting, response temperature, and lapse rate.

**Parameters:**

- validities: validities
- confidence_threshold: [0.05, 0.2]

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This is a preregistered high-consistency exceedance indicator: it asks whether at least 90% of choices agree with the option favored by the first discriminating cue. It is not logically guaranteed by either theory because both include response noise and lapses. Under the advocated TTB parameter range, broad heterogeneity in beta and lapse rate yields pooled first-cue consistency substantially below 90%. The competing cascade uses beta between 4 and 16, lapses no greater than 0.15, and all six cues exceed its stopping threshold; it should therefore exceed 90% consistency despite weaker evidence at later cue ranks. Dichotomizing at a threshold lying between these predictions produces a large canonical separation, while 96 repeated trials make each subject's classification reasonably stable. The metric remains well-defined on both pooled data and single-subject slices."
