# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** This design creates three matched adjacency contrasts, each at a different display midpoint. In every base trial, exactly two equally valid 82% experts favor A and one less-valid 70% expert favors B; the 97% expert and all other experts tie. Within each matched contrast, the two A experts have the same midpoint but are either adjacent or separated by six intervening positions: positions 7–8 versus 4 and 11, positions 10–11 versus 7 and 14, and positions 13–14 versus 10 and 17 (one-based). Thus validity, recommendation count, opposing evidence, and mean serial position are held fixed while only adjacency changes. Structure-Gated Ensemble Lexicographic Retrieval predicts an adjacency advantage. An adjacent same-direction pair becomes a high-fidelity pair chunk, whereas two separated sources become a single recommendation-level ensemble whose extra-source gain is at most negligible; hence A choices should be reliably higher for adjacent than separated pairs. Chunked Source-Retrieval Lexicographic Search predicts the opposite sign. Its source-similarity load is identical regardless of spacing, but adjacency usually collapses the two A sources into one chunk that retains the full attribution load and offers only one retrieval opportunity. When separated, the two loaded source representations remain distinct and can independently rescue one another; because groups of two are exempt from the shared gate, this should increase A choices. The weak singleton position penalty cannot explain the contrast because each adjacent/separated pair is midpoint-matched and its maximum magnitude is tiny relative to the second retrieval opportunity. The critical quantitative signature is therefore a sign-reversing adjacency effect: adjacent greater than separated under the advocated theory, but separated greater than adjacent under the competitor, replicated at three locations. The six exact A/B reversals balance response side, producing 12 unique pairs repeated eight times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Structure-Gated Ensemble Lexicographic Retrieval. Decision makers preserve the communicated validity hierarchy and search encoded recommendation units from highest to lowest validity, but the units available to search depend on the grouping structure of the display. An isolated expert is represented as a source-specific item. Two adjacent experts making the same recommendation are encoded as a compact pair chunk with high, position-invariant fidelity. Contiguous same-direction runs of three or more experts are instead compressed into a single ensemble whose source-to-validity binding becomes progressively less reliable with run length. A uniquely strongest expert embedded inside such a run remains structurally identifiable, whereas a strongest expert at a run boundary receives no such protection from overload. Same-direction experts separated by inactive or opposing experts are represented by a recommendation-level ensemble: additional separated sources provide only a negligible, rapidly saturating retrieval benefit and impose no distance-based crowding cost. Independently, validity labels have a localized nonlinear binding-uncertainty region, so a larger communicated validity gap need not imply more reliable retrieval. Serial position has no terminal-recency bonus. Only isolated sources in sufficiently long displays exhibit a weak subject-specific monotonic accessibility gradient centered near zero, allowing heterogeneous serial-position effects without a systematic pooled recency advantage. Once the encoded units are formed, choice is primarily lexicographic: the first successfully retrieved unit in descending communicated-validity order determines the intended response. Complete retrieval failure produces guessing, and a small execution lapse can reverse the intended response.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Chunked Source-Retrieval Lexicographic Search. People intend to inspect expert recommendations in descending order of communicated validity, but a cue can govern choice only if its source identity, validity label, and current recommendation are jointly retrieved. Retrieval interference is source-based rather than spatial: active sources recommending the same option interfere in proportion to their subjective-validity similarity, regardless of their physical distance. Consequently, rearranging a fixed source set does not release interference. Adjacent sources giving the same recommendation can instead be encoded as a single recommendation chunk. A chunk enters the validity-ordered search at the rank of its most valid member and, if retrieved, directly recommends an option; this makes a translated two-source cluster nearly position-invariant. Chunk retrieval nevertheless retains the attribution load generated by its constituent sources, so increasing a redundant set can overload retrieval even when the recommendation is coherent. In addition, sets of at least three similar same-direction sources share a correlated source-attribution gate. If that common binding episode fails, all representations carrying that recommendation are temporarily unavailable; thus redundant cues cannot always rescue one another through independent retrieval attempts. The shared gate depends on source count and validity similarity but not physical spacing. Isolated sources have a very weak monotonic late-position accessibility loss, while chunks receive no positional bonus or penalty; there is no terminal-recency mechanism. Communicated validity is nonlinearly compressed, and source binding has a localized uncertainty peak in the moderate-to-high diagnosticity region. This can make a moderately high-validity source less retrievable than nearly nondiagnostic sources and thereby produce inverse validity-gap effects. Search remains lexicographic after retrieval: the first retrieved discriminating cue or chunk determines the intended response. If nothing is retrieved, the person guesses, and a small independent execution lapse can reverse the intended response.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "The metric is the adjacency effect on choosing the option supported by the two equally valid 82% experts, after recoding the A/B reversals so positive values always indicate an adjacency advantage. It derives condition and supported option directly from each stimulus rather than relying on randomized trial order. Structure-Gated Ensemble Lexicographic Retrieval predicts a positive effect because an adjacent pair receives a high-fidelity representation, whereas the competing theory predicts a negative effect because separated sources provide two retrieval opportunities while an adjacent chunk usually provides one. Each subject contributes 48 adjacent and 48 separated observations, so the within-subject difference removes general pair-choice and response-side biases while retaining low sampling variance."
