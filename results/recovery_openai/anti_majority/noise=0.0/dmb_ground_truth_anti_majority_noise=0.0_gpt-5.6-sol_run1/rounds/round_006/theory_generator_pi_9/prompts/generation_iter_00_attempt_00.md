# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_8`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_7`).

Replace pi_7 with a new theory of competition-normalized recommendation retrieval. The new theory should preserve validity-ordered, predominantly lexicographic choice and localized nonlinear validity-binding uncertainty, which jointly account for Experiments 3-8. However, redundant same-direction cues should normally be encoded at the recommendation level, with rapidly saturating reliability and correlated retrieval, so neither adjacency nor separation creates an independent-rescue effect. This predicts the near-zero adjacency effect in Experiment 2 and the near-zero spacing and redundancy effects in Experiments 11-13. Overload should be conditional on dense, extended contiguous runs under competing evidence—not a source-count penalty that applies regardless of spacing—allowing the strong contiguous-run decrement in Experiment 10 while avoiding pi_7's catastrophic Experiment 13 prediction. Chunk fidelity should not receive a special two-cue adjacency bonus, and the location of the strongest member within a run should not confer protection, matching Experiments 1 and 2 and distinguishing the new theory from pi_8. Add a weak display-load-dependent monotonic accessibility gradient for isolated decisive cues to address Experiment 9, but no terminal-recency mechanism, consistent with Experiments 12 and 14. Parameterization should separately identify validity-binding uncertainty, contiguous-density overload, recommendation-level saturation, contextual position loss, and lapse; it should not contain a global spacing-invariant source-interference term.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.835)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.557)

**Description**
Chunked Source-Retrieval Lexicographic Search. People intend to inspect expert recommendations in descending order of communicated validity, but a cue can govern choice only if its source identity, validity label, and current recommendation are jointly retrieved. Retrieval interference is source-based rather than spatial: active sources recommending the same option interfere in proportion to their subjective-validity similarity, regardless of their physical distance. Consequently, rearranging a fixed source set does not release interference. Adjacent sources giving the same recommendation can instead be encoded as a single recommendation chunk. A chunk enters the validity-ordered search at the rank of its most valid member and, if retrieved, directly recommends an option; this makes a translated two-source cluster nearly position-invariant. Chunk retrieval nevertheless retains the attribution load generated by its constituent sources, so increasing a redundant set can overload retrieval even when the recommendation is coherent. In addition, sets of at least three similar same-direction sources share a correlated source-attribution gate. If that common binding episode fails, all representations carrying that recommendation are temporarily unavailable; thus redundant cues cannot always rescue one another through independent retrieval attempts. The shared gate depends on source count and validity similarity but not physical spacing. Isolated sources have a very weak monotonic late-position accessibility loss, while chunks receive no positional bonus or penalty; there is no terminal-recency mechanism. Communicated validity is nonlinearly compressed, and source binding has a localized uncertainty peak in the moderate-to-high diagnosticity region. This can make a moderately high-validity source less retrievable than nearly nondiagnostic sources and thereby produce inverse validity-gap effects. Search remains lexicographic after retrieval: the first retrieved discriminating cue or chunk determines the intended response. If nothing is retrieved, the person guesses, and a small independent execution lapse can reverse the intended response.

**Description**
Structure-Gated Ensemble Lexicographic Retrieval. Decision makers preserve the communicated validity hierarchy and search encoded recommendation units from highest to lowest validity, but the units available to search depend on the grouping structure of the display. An isolated expert is represented as a source-specific item. Two adjacent experts making the same recommendation are encoded as a compact pair chunk with high, position-invariant fidelity. Contiguous same-direction runs of three or more experts are instead compressed into a single ensemble whose source-to-validity binding becomes progressively less reliable with run length. A uniquely strongest expert embedded inside such a run remains structurally identifiable, whereas a strongest expert at a run boundary receives no such protection from overload. Same-direction experts separated by inactive or opposing experts are represented by a recommendation-level ensemble: additional separated sources provide only a negligible, rapidly saturating retrieval benefit and impose no distance-based crowding cost. Independently, validity labels have a localized nonlinear binding-uncertainty region, so a larger communicated validity gap need not imply more reliable retrieval. Serial position has no terminal-recency bonus. Only isolated sources in sufficiently long displays exhibit a weak subject-specific monotonic accessibility gradient centered near zero, allowing heterogeneous serial-position effects without a systematic pooled recency advantage. Once the encoded units are formed, choice is primarily lexicographic: the first successfully retrieved unit in descending communicated-validity order determines the intended response. Complete retrieval failure produces guessing, and a small execution lapse can reverse the intended response.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL

{
  "theory": "Competition-Normalized Recommendation Race. People first compress all currently active experts favoring the same option into a single recommendation-level representation. Consequently, redundant experts are retrieved correlatively rather than as independent opportunities for rescue, and reliability gains from additional experts saturate almost immediately. Each recommendation is indexed by its strongest communicated validity and the two opposing recommendation representations compete for retrieval before a validity-ordered, predominantly lexicographic decision. Source-to-validity binding has a localized nonlinear uncertainty region, allowing moderate-to-high validity cues to be less accessible than cues outside that region. Spatial arrangement ordinarily has no effect. The exception is density overload: a recommendation loses binding fidelity when most of its support forms an extended contiguous run and the opposing recommendation itself has multiple active supporters. This competition gate prevents long runs from being penalized merely for containing many sources and leaves adjacent pairs, separated redundancy, and long runs facing a singleton largely unaffected. The strongest member's location within a run provides no protection. In long displays only, an isolated recommendation receives a weak monotonic accessibility loss with later position; there is no terminal-recency process. Failure to retrieve either recommendation produces guessing, followed by a small symmetric response lapse.",

Same-direction sources therefore share one retrieval event, eliminating independent rescue and the catastrophic spacing-invariant source-load penalty that harmed Experiments 11, 13, and 14. Adjacency by itself changes neither fidelity nor priority, so there is no special two-cue bonus and adjacent versus separated pairs should be nearly equivalent in Experiments 2, 10, and 14. Additional sources provide only a tiny saturating gain, yielding near-zero redundancy effects in Experiment 11. Contiguity matters only through a separately parameterized density-overload mechanism requiring a run longer than three and a multiply supported competing recommendation. This permits a substantial decrement for dense extended runs such as the terminal redundancy manipulation while sparing separated sets, adjacent pairs, and runs opposed by only one source. Overload depends on run length and density, not on whether the strongest member is internal or at a boundary, directly predicting the null contrast in Experiment 13. The localized binding-uncertainty function preserves the inverse validity-gap effects needed for Experiments 6 and 8, while recommendation priorities remain based on communicated validity and thus preserve predominantly lexicographic behavior in Experiments 1-5. Finally, the positive position-loss parameter operates only for isolated recommendations and only as display load rises beyond 24 cues. It can produce the weak monotonic decline in a 32-cue display without introducing terminal recency or contaminating shorter-display Experiments 12 and 14. The model separately identifies binding uncertainty, contiguous-density overload, recommendation saturation, contextual position loss, and lapse, and contains no global source-interference or spacing parameter."
