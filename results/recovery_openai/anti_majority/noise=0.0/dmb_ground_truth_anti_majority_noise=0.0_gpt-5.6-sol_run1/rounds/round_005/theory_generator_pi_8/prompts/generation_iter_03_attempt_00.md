# generation_iter_03_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_7`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_6`).

Replace pi_6 with a Structure-Sensitive Ensemble Retrieval theory. Communicated validity should continue to set a primarily lexicographic hierarchy, while retrieval fidelity has three distinct components. First, validity-label binding has a nonlinear, localized uncertainty region, allowing inverse validity-gap effects such as Experiment 8. Second, serial position has no terminal-recency bonus; only a weak load-dependent late-position accessibility decline may emerge in very long displays, accounting for Experiment 9 while preserving the null effects in Experiments 2 and 12. Third, redundancy is encoded according to grouping structure rather than generic spatial proximity or source-count interference. A same-direction adjacent pair forms a compact, position-invariant chunk. Longer contiguous runs create an over-compressed ensemble whose internal source attribution degrades with run length, producing Experiment 10's impairment. Widely separated same-direction sources are assigned to a recommendation-level ensemble with strongly diminishing returns but little additional retrieval cost, yielding the near-zero count effect in Experiment 1. Mere changes in average spacing among several noncontiguous supporters should have little effect, as in Experiment 11. The new model should implement separate parameters for pair chunking, contiguous-run overload, and saturating noncontiguous redundancy; it should not use pi_6's terminal recency term or a generic distance-weighted crowding penalty. Parameter ranges should favor near-zero position and spacing contrasts, permit moderate contiguous-run impairment, retain high validity-guided choice, and include subject heterogeneity in weak serial-position effects to accommodate Experiment 2's elevated variance without creating a positive pooled recency effect.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.547)

**Description**
Chunked Source-Retrieval Lexicographic Search. People intend to inspect expert recommendations in descending order of communicated validity, but a cue can govern choice only if its source identity, validity label, and current recommendation are jointly retrieved. Retrieval interference is source-based rather than spatial: active sources recommending the same option interfere in proportion to their subjective-validity similarity, regardless of their physical distance. Consequently, rearranging a fixed source set does not release interference. Adjacent sources giving the same recommendation can instead be encoded as a single recommendation chunk. A chunk enters the validity-ordered search at the rank of its most valid member and, if retrieved, directly recommends an option; this makes a translated two-source cluster nearly position-invariant. Chunk retrieval nevertheless retains the attribution load generated by its constituent sources, so increasing a redundant set can overload retrieval even when the recommendation is coherent. In addition, sets of at least three similar same-direction sources share a correlated source-attribution gate. If that common binding episode fails, all representations carrying that recommendation are temporarily unavailable; thus redundant cues cannot always rescue one another through independent retrieval attempts. The shared gate depends on source count and validity similarity but not physical spacing. Isolated sources have a very weak monotonic late-position accessibility loss, while chunks receive no positional bonus or penalty; there is no terminal-recency mechanism. Communicated validity is nonlinearly compressed, and source binding has a localized uncertainty peak in the moderate-to-high diagnosticity region. This can make a moderately high-validity source less retrievable than nearly nondiagnostic sources and thereby produce inverse validity-gap effects. Search remains lexicographic after retrieval: the first retrieved discriminating cue or chunk determines the intended response. If nothing is retrieved, the person guesses, and a small independent execution lapse can reverse the intended response.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.428)

**Description**
Confidence-Capped Cascade Integration proposes that people translate each communicated cue validity into an absolute diagnosticity signal and inspect cues from most to least valid. A discriminating cue controls the decision immediately when its diagnosticity exceeds a subject-specific confidence threshold. Earlier weak cues do not force premature stopping: search continues until a sufficiently diagnostic cue is encountered. If no discriminating cue reaches threshold, the decision maker switches to compensatory integration, summing all discriminating cues with weights determined by their stated validities. Thus, the theory produces one-cue dominance when reliable cues are available but graded multi-cue sensitivity when every cue is weak. Subject heterogeneity arises from differences in confidence threshold, sensitivity to stated validity, integration weighting, response temperature, and lapse rate.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.0501 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0391 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0442 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0391 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Structure-Gated Ensemble Lexicographic Retrieval. Decision makers preserve the communicated validity hierarchy and search encoded recommendation units from highest to lowest validity, but the units available to search depend on the grouping structure of the display. An isolated expert is represented as a source-specific item. Two adjacent experts making the same recommendation are encoded as a compact pair chunk with high, position-invariant fidelity. Contiguous same-direction runs of three or more experts are instead compressed into a single ensemble whose source-to-validity binding becomes progressively less reliable with run length. Same-direction experts separated by inactive or opposing experts are represented by a recommendation-level ensemble: additional separated sources provide only a negligible, rapidly saturating retrieval benefit and impose no distance-based crowding cost. Independently, validity labels have a localized nonlinear binding-uncertainty region, so a larger communicated validity gap need not imply more reliable retrieval. Serial position has no terminal-recency bonus. Only isolated sources in sufficiently long displays exhibit a weak subject-specific monotonic accessibility gradient centered near zero, allowing heterogeneous serial-position effects without a systematic pooled recency advantage. Once the encoded units are formed, choice is primarily lexicographic: the first successfully retrieved unit in descending communicated-validity order determines the intended response. Complete retrieval failure produces guessing, and a small execution lapse can reverse the intended response.

`rationale`: This is a minimal retuning of the accepted model. Raising the contiguous-run overload range from [0.3, 0.55] to [0.45, 0.65] strengthens impairment for five- and six-source runs, targeting Experiment 8's underpredicted negative redundancy effect while reducing the excessive majority override in Experiment 5. The noncontiguous redundancy gain is narrowed from [0.0, 0.12] to [0.0, 0.02], making separated-source count and ordinary spacing contrasts closer to null in Experiments 9 and 11. Finally, the long-display position slope is centered on zero with substantial subject heterogeneity rather than having a positive population mean. This should remove the erroneous positive pooled Experiment 7 contrast while increasing its between-subject variance. The position term remains a smooth monotonic gradient applied only to isolated sources under high display load, not a terminal-recency bonus. Pair chunking, nonlinear validity-label uncertainty, communicated-validity ranking, and all other mechanisms are unchanged.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed Structure-Sensitive Ensemble Retrieval family and captures most qualitative constraints: Experiments 1–3 retain lexicographic behavior; Experiment 4 is close (0.1495 vs. 0.1620); Experiment 6 reproduces the inverse validity-gap effect (-0.1062 vs. -0.1275); Experiment 10 correctly eliminates terminal recency for adjacent pairs (-0.0020 vs. -0.0045); and Experiment 12 remains near zero (0.0112 vs. 0.0150). However, two central effects remain materially underfit. The contiguous-run impairment in Experiment 8 is too weak (-0.1669 versus -0.2675), and the model consequently permits too many majority overrides in Experiment 5 (0.1919 versus 0.1613). The long-display serial-position result in Experiment 7 also has the wrong sign (0.0244 versus -0.0543), with far too little between-subject variance. Smaller residual positive contrasts in Experiments 9 and 11 (0.0334 and 0.0162 versus -0.0056 and -0.0225) indicate that nominally null spacing/count manipulations still exert slightly too much influence, although these discrepancies are less severe.
Rationale: Keep the current mechanism family, but retune its separable components. First, moderately strengthen contiguous-run overload—preferably by raising its lower bound or making the existing overload function somewhat steeper for runs of five or six. This should deepen Experiment 8’s negative redundancy contrast and simultaneously reduce the excessive majority override in Experiment 5. Do not compensate with generic crowding or distance penalties. Second, shrink the mean long-display position slope toward zero while increasing subject heterogeneity around this weak effect. The present positive pooled Experiment 7 contrast is farther from the observed weak negative value than a null prediction would be, and its variance (0.0025) is much too small relative to 0.0193. Because terminal recency is prohibited, the appropriate in-family target is a near-zero pooled effect rather than adding a recency bonus. Third, set noncontiguous redundancy gain closer to zero and avoid any incidental dependence on average spacing, which should reduce the small positive residuals in Experiments 9 and 11. These should be modest parameter/function-shape adjustments: the pair chunking and nonlinear validity-binding components are already performing well and should be preserved.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0501 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0391 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision is a genuine improvement and remains faithful to the prescribed Structure-Sensitive Ensemble Retrieval family. It preserves the principal successes: Experiments 1–3 show the required primarily lexicographic behavior; Experiment 4 is close (0.1535 vs. 0.1620); Experiment 5 is now substantially closer (0.1762 vs. 0.1613); Experiment 10 correctly shows no terminal advantage for adjacent pairs; and Experiment 12 remains near null. Strengthening contiguous-run overload also moved Experiment 8 markedly in the correct direction, from -0.1669 to -0.2144. Nevertheless, Experiment 8 still underestimates the central run impairment by 0.0531, while Experiment 9 now has an appreciable erroneous spacing/arrangement contrast (0.0509 vs. -0.0056). Experiment 11 retains a smaller wrong-signed count effect (0.0050 vs. -0.0225). The inverse validity-gap effect in Experiment 6 is qualitatively correct but too weak (-0.1000 vs. -0.1275). Experiment 7 moved toward the observed direction, but its residual discrepancy is less concerning because the recommendation favors a near-zero pooled position effect rather than a strong systematic trend. Across Experiments 6–8, the candidate also underproduces the observed between-subject variance.
Rationale: Build on the accepted revision: the previous advice was successful, so retain the stronger run overload, near-zero serial-position mean, and absence of generic distance crowding. Make only targeted in-family adjustments. First, increase contiguous-run overload slightly, or make its growth somewhat steeper specifically from runs of three to five or six, to close the remaining Experiment 8 gap and bring Experiment 5 down modestly. Avoid a large global increase because it could worsen Experiment 9. Second, allow the saturating noncontiguous redundancy term to be centered just below zero rather than constrained to [0, 0.02]—for example, a narrow range permitting a very small recommendation-level ensemble attribution cost. This is not a distance penalty: it depends only on forming the noncontiguous ensemble. A small negative asymptotic effect should lower sparse-ensemble congruence in Experiment 9 and move the high-minus-low count contrast in Experiment 11 toward its weakly negative observed value, while retaining the prescribed near-null redundancy effect. Third, mildly strengthen or sharpen the localized binding-uncertainty contrast to deepen Experiment 6's inverse-gap effect, preferably by adjusting uncertainty strength or width rather than changing communicated-validity ranking. Widen heterogeneity in binding uncertainty and run overload modestly to improve the underpredicted variances. Do not chase Experiment 7's negative point estimate with terminal recency or a sizable population position slope; preserve the current weak, heterogeneous monotonic position component.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0391 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0442 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains faithful to the prescribed Structure-Sensitive Ensemble Retrieval family, but it was rejected because its gains were too narrowly concentrated. It nearly perfectly fits the contiguous-run effect in Experiment 8 (-0.2688 versus -0.2675), improves the inverse validity-gap effect in Experiment 6 (-0.1225 versus -0.1275), and moves Experiment 11 toward its weak negative count effect. However, relative to the accepted iteration 2 base, it worsens Experiments 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 12. The clearest failure is Experiment 9: the sparse-minus-dense contrast rises from 0.0509 to 0.0734 despite the observed near-zero value of -0.0056. The negative noncontiguous-redundancy gain therefore had the opposite of its intended effect. Because sparse arrangements are represented as noncontiguous ensembles while dense arrangements can become pairs or overloaded runs, penalizing the former mechanically increases sparse-over-dense congruence. The stronger binding manipulation also appears too global: although it repairs Experiment 6, it coincides with poorer fits in Experiments 4 and 5. Between-subject variance remains substantially underpredicted for the validity-gap and long-display position effects.
Rationale: Build again from the unchanged accepted iteration 2 base, not from this rejected parameterization. The previous recommendation to make noncontiguous redundancy gain negative was rejected by the gate and should not be repeated: keep that gain approximately zero and do not use it to fit Experiment 9 or 11. Instead, address Experiment 9 through the existing contiguous-run attribution mechanism. The current pure run-length penalty treats every long run alike, so dense conditions in Experiment 9 are impaired even when a uniquely most-valid member should be recoverable. Gate or normalize run overload by within-run validity-label ambiguity—for example, the number or similarity of plausible representative cues—while retaining length-dependent overload. This should permit strong impairment for the attributionally ambiguous long runs in Experiment 8 without generating a generic dense-versus-sparse contrast in Experiment 9. Use an overload magnitude between accepted iteration 2 and the rejected current setting rather than another global increase. For Experiment 6, preserve localized nonlinear binding uncertainty but sharpen its center or width selectively instead of raising uncertainty strength globally; the latter likely contributed to the regressions in Experiments 4 and 5. Finally, retain no terminal-recency term and keep Experiment 12 inactive under the long-display gate. A very small positive-centered accessibility-decline slope for displays longer than 24 features could move Experiment 7 modestly negative, but it should remain heterogeneous and close to zero. Pair fidelity should otherwise be left unchanged, as Experiment 10 already supports position-invariant pair chunking.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0442 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "Structure-Gated Ensemble Lexicographic Retrieval. Decision makers preserve the communicated validity hierarchy and search encoded recommendation units from highest to lowest validity, but the units available to search depend on the grouping structure of the display. An isolated expert is represented as a source-specific item. Two adjacent experts making the same recommendation are encoded as a compact pair chunk with high, position-invariant fidelity. Contiguous same-direction runs of three or more experts are compressed into an ensemble, but overload depends jointly on run length and ambiguity about which member carries the ensemble's strongest validity label. Thus, long runs of similarly valid sources suffer attribution failure, whereas a uniquely most-valid member remains recoverable from a dense run. Same-direction experts separated by inactive or opposing experts form a recommendation-level ensemble with negligible, rapidly saturating retrieval benefit and no distance-based crowding cost. Validity labels have a localized nonlinear binding-uncertainty region, so larger communicated validity gaps need not improve retrieval. Serial position has no terminal-recency bonus. Only isolated sources in sufficiently long displays exhibit a weak, heterogeneous monotonic accessibility decline. Choice is primarily lexicographic: the first successfully retrieved unit in descending communicated-validity order determines the intended response. Complete retrieval failure produces guessing, and a small execution lapse can reverse the intended response.",

The overload range is raised only modestly so that ambiguous five- and six-source runs remain sufficiently impaired and Experiment 5 moves slightly downward. The noncontiguous gain remains nonnegative and near zero because the rejected negative-gain edit mechanically worsened Experiment 9. The binding-uncertainty width is narrowed slightly, rather than globally increasing uncertainty strength, to sharpen the localized inverse-gap effect in Experiment 6 while preserving validity-guided choice elsewhere.
