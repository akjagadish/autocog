# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace pi_4 with an Accessibility-Gated Lexicographic Search theory. Communicated validities establish a predominantly fixed descending cue order, as in instruction-anchored lexicographic choice, but successful use of a cue requires that its identity, validity, and current value be retrieved. Retrieval or encoding failure should increase with absolute display position, list length, and cue-specific complexity, with stable subject-level accessibility differences. Search proceeds down the advertised-validity ranking among cues that are successfully accessible; it stops at the first accessible discriminating cue, without integrating lower-cue votes. This differs from pi_1 by making cue availability—and therefore errors—systematically dependent on absolute position and cognitive accessibility rather than using only cue-independent response noise. It differs from pi_4 because validities do not enter a noisy priority race and small validity gaps do not intrinsically cause order reversals. The theory predicts low majority override in Experiment 1 because the 72% cue is normally retrieved, while occasional failure can produce the observed roughly 16% override. In Experiment 2, the higher-validity cue moves from an early absolute position at the smallest gap to the end of an 18-cue display at the largest gap; declining accessibility can therefore produce the observed slightly negative endpoint contrast rather than pi_4's large positive crossover. It should retain lexicographic dominance in Experiments 3 and 6, avoid graded tally-margin sensitivity in Experiment 4, and allow imperfect first-cue consistency in Experiment 5. The new model should include subject-level baseline retrieval ability, an absolute-position/list-length accessibility gradient, modest cue-specific accessibility variation, and separate execution lapses, with ranges constrained so that advertised validity normally dominates rather than permitting an unconstrained race that can mimic arbitrary cue orders.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Accessibility-Gated Validity Cascade: Communicated validities create a stable, descending cue hierarchy rather than a noisy priority race. On each trial, however, a cue can control choice only if its identity, stated validity, and displayed value are successfully accessible. Accessibility varies stably across people and cues and declines with list length and absolute display position, with a modest accelerating cost for cues near the end of long displays. Search follows the advertised-validity hierarchy among accessible cues and stops at the first accessible cue that discriminates. Lower-ranked evidence is never integrated. If no discriminating cue is accessible, the decision maker guesses. Retrieval failures are distinct from response execution errors: after forming an intended choice, the person can accidentally reverse it or lapse to a random response.

`rationale`:
The model preserves the experiment-invariant success of lexicographic choice while replacing pi_4's problematic noisy priority race. Validity gaps never directly generate order reversals: whenever two cues are accessible, the one with higher advertised validity is consulted first. Deviations arise because a cue can be unavailable, and that failure is systematically related to cognitive accessibility. Early high-validity cues are normally retrieved, supporting dominance in Experiments 1, 3, and 4. Occasional retrieval and execution failures permit imperfect consistency and the modest majority override in Experiment 5. Most importantly, the late-position cost makes the high-validity cue at the end of the 18-cue display less accessible than an early high-validity cue, allowing the negative endpoint contrast in Experiment 6 without claiming that larger validity gaps make the validity ordering noisier. Because every latent decision still stops on one accessible cue, the model does not acquire graded tally-margin sensitivity in Experiment 2. The parameter ranges keep baseline accessibility high, cue-specific variation modest, and execution noise bounded, preventing the mechanism from mimicking arbitrary cue rankings.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0114 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0114.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate captures the cross-experiment qualitative pattern unusually well while remaining faithful to the prescribed accessibility-gated lexicographic family. It exactly matches the pooled categorical outcomes in Experiments 1\u20133: lexicographic dominance survives strong majority conflict in Experiment 1, graded tally-margin sensitivity is absent in Experiment 2, and performance remains imperfect enough to fall below the 90% consistency threshold in Experiment 3. It also closely matches the low override rates in Experiments 4 and 5 (0.1520 vs. 0.1620 and 0.1537 vs. 0.1613). Most importantly, Experiment 6 has the correct negative endpoint contrast, -0.0900 versus -0.1275, a major improvement over the positive crossover produced by pi_4 and consistent with declining accessibility at late absolute positions. The main residual is that the Experiment 6 position effect is somewhat too weak. Between-subject variability is also imperfect: the simulation is more homogeneous than the data in Experiments 4\u20136, while producing unnecessary subject-level variation in the categorical metrics of Experiments 2 and 3. These are secondary to the canonical pooled estimates.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The accepted candidate has a low aggregate loss and reproduces every central directional and categorical signature across all six experiments without drifting into a noisy validity-priority race or evidence integration. The small underprediction of the negative Experiment 6 contrast and the variance discrepancies do not justify another iteration given the strong pooled fit and the risk that strengthening the terminal-position penalty or heterogeneity would degrade Experiments 1\u20135. This is a credible experiment-invariant implementation of the arbiter\u2019s recommended mechanism and is good enough to retain."
