# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace pi_1 with an Accessibility-Anchored Fixed Lexicographic theory. Subjects should maintain a stable cue hierarchy determined primarily by display position, perceptual salience, and long-run accessibility rather than sorting cues by communicated validity. On each trial they inspect cues in this stable order and stop at the first discriminating cue; occasional order perturbations and response lapses may occur, but communicated validities should exert only a weak subject-level adjustment and should not be amplified merely because validity rank happens to align with position. This differs from pi_1 by denying that instructed validity determines the search order, and from pi_3 by rejecting mapping-simplicity gating and substantial trial-wise Plackett-Luce order variability. Its concentrated fixed-order search predicts near-zero cue-8 choice in Experiment 1, no rank-distance gradient in Experiment 2, little or no effect of the number of later conflicting cues in Experiment 3, and near-zero agreement with a non-position-aligned validity hierarchy in Experiment 4. The new theory should include subject-specific but cross-task-stable accessibility weights, strong positional anchoring, low order noise, a small lapse rate, and an optional weak validity-instruction weight. Future discriminating experiments should cross display position and validity while separately estimating absolute early-cue adherence, order stability across repeated trials, and transfer after cue positions are rearranged.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Accessibility-Anchored Fixed Lexicographic Search. Each person constructs one stable cue hierarchy at the beginning of a task and reuses it across trials. Priority is dominated by display position, with earlier cues receiving a large accessibility advantage. Subject-specific long-run accessibility or salience offsets can alter priorities locally, while communicated validity provides only a weak additive adjustment. Thus validity can resolve competition between nearby positions but cannot promote a late cue merely because it has the highest instructed validity. Choice follows the first discriminating cue in this fixed hierarchy. Rare search slips skip that cue and consult the next discriminating cue, while bounded response imprecision and a small lapse rate generate occasional choices against the selected cue. The hierarchy is not resampled trial by trial and does not depend on the number of conflicting later cues.

- response_precision: [1.45, 1.85]
- epsilon: [0.01, 0.04]

`rationale`:
This is a minimal parameter calibration of the accepted model; the prediction and policy mechanisms are unchanged. The validity-to-position ratio is increased slightly and tightly constrained, while accessibility-offset dispersion is reduced. In Experiment 2, the large instructed-validity difference between the first two displayed cues can now reliably let the exceptionally valid second-position cue outrank the first. For the supplied balanced stimulus set, that local reversal removes the previous systematic negative agreement without turning the complete hierarchy into validity-ranked search. Narrower ranges and smaller accessibility offsets should also reduce the excessive between-subject variance. The cumulative positional cost remains steep: a late cue must overcome several positional steps, so cue 8 in Experiment 3 remains inaccessible despite its high validity. Experiments 1 and 4 should therefore retain their near-zero conflict-count and rank-distance effects, while Experiment 2 moves upward toward zero.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0497 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0560 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0497.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed accessibility-anchored fixed-lexicographic family and captures its main cross-experiment signatures. Experiment 3 is very well fit: the simulated cue-8 classification is 0.0118 versus 0.0089 observed, showing that a late high-validity cue is not promoted over early cues. Experiment 4 is also nearly exact (0.0058 versus 0.0042), correctly eliminating a validity-rank-distance gradient. Experiment 1 has the correct near-zero qualitative pattern, although it somewhat underpredicts the small observed conflict effect (0.0046 versus 0.0283). The principal failure is Experiment 2: agreement with the validity-ranked cue is too negative (-0.0979 versus -0.0050), and its between-subject variance is excessive (0.0165 versus 0.0051). Thus the model's positional hierarchy is systematically opposing the highest-validity discriminating cue in this stimulus set more than humans do.
Rationale: Because this candidate was accepted and already has low aggregate loss, retain its mechanism and make a targeted calibration rather than redesigning it. The most promising in-family adjustment is to slightly increase the validity-to-position ratio so the exceptionally valid cue at position 2 in Experiment 2 can compete more evenly with position 1. This can be done with a modestly higher validity weight or slightly lower position strength, while preserving a steep cumulative positional barrier that prevents cue 8 from rising in Experiment 3. Narrowing the parameter ranges and reducing accessibility-offset dispersion should also reduce Experiment 2's excessive between-subject variance. Avoid globally lowering response precision: that could move Experiment 2 toward zero but would increase late-cue choices toward chance and likely spoil the excellent Experiment 3 fit. The next version should preserve the near-zero effects in Experiments 1, 3, and 4 while moving Experiment 2 upward by roughly 0.09 toward zero.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0497 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0560 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed accessibility-anchored fixed-lexicographic family, and Experiment 3 is essentially exact (0.0084 versus 0.0089), confirming that the late high-validity cue remains inaccessible. Experiment 2 also improved dramatically to -0.0075 versus -0.0050, with nearly exact between-subject variance. However, that gain came from a tightly calibrated validity-to-position ratio that appears to cross a discrete ordering threshold. It worsened Experiment 1 from 0.0046 to -0.0354, reversing the observed small positive conflict effect of 0.0283, and worsened Experiment 4 from 0.0058 to 0.0133. Consequently, aggregate loss increased from 0.0497 to 0.0560 and the candidate was rejected. The problem is not the mechanism family but the brittle population-wide cue-order reversal induced by the stronger validity adjustment.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Do not repeat the rejected strategy of further increasing and tightly constraining the validity-to-position ratio. Build on the unchanged accepted base and restore its position strength, validity weight, and accessibility dispersion. Instead, try a modest increase in the existing search-slip/order-perturbation parameter, preferably narrowly centered around roughly 0.05 rather than 0\u20130.03. In Experiment 2, occasionally consulting the second discriminating cue can soften the accepted model's excessive negative validity agreement without permanently promoting cue 2 for nearly every subject. This knob should be comparatively safe elsewhere: in Experiment 1 the second discriminating cue opposes the first across conflict levels, so a fixed skip probability mainly changes absolute adherence rather than its conflict-count contrast; in Experiment 3 the early discriminating cues generally agree against cue 8, so skipping one should not elevate cue 8; and in Experiment 4 it should affect the two-cue conflicts relatively uniformly across distances. Keep response precision unchanged, because global response noise risks destroying the excellent Experiment 3 fit. This is a more faithful and less threshold-sensitive route to improving Experiment 2 than the rejected validity-weight increase."
