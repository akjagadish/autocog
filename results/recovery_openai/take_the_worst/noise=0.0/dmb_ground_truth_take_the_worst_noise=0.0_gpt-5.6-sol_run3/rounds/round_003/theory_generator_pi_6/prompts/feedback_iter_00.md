# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_3`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_3`).

Replace pi_3 with a Structure-Sensitive Anchoring-and-Comparison theory. The new theory should propose that subjects first construct a display representation whose organization depends jointly on discriminating-cue saturation, repeated cue coalitions, spatial grouping, and the presence of a stable focal or anchor cue—not solely on absolute conflict count or validity-position rank coherence. Sparse or readily chunked displays should induce strong anchoring on an early cue or early cue coalition, permitting earliest-cue choice rates near 0.85 as in Experiment 2. Highly saturated displays with salient opposing coalitions should recruit comparative or tally-like processing, accounting for Experiment 8. The shift must be broad and structure-sensitive rather than a fixed transition near k=7.3, so k=7 and k=9 displays can yield nearly identical behavior as in Experiment 1. Communicated validity should usually have little direct effect, consistent with Experiments 4-7, but may reinforce a cue already made focal by position, repetition, or task structure; it should not be controlled by a global rank-correlation gate. Include subject variation in anchor strength and comparison recruitment to accommodate Experiment 2's larger observed between-subject variance. The new theory should make separable predictions from pi_5 by holding k constant while independently manipulating saturation k/n, spatial grouping, cue-coalition stability across trials, and whether one cue repeatedly occupies an invariant focal role. Its model should be constrained to reproduce four key facts simultaneously: no k=7-to-k=9 discontinuity, very strong k=5 primacy, negligible late-validity and validity-distance promotion, and majority-sensitive responding in fully saturated displays.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Relational Chunk–Anchor Arbitration theory. Before choosing, people perceptually organize discriminating cues into contiguous, same-direction coalitions rather than treating conflict count as the primary control variable. An early compact coalition becomes an anchor when it has a coherent opposing coalition, recurs across trials, or occupies an invariant focal location. The anchor normally determines choice, and communicated validity can only slightly reinforce cues already contained in that focal coalition. Comparative processing is recruited when the display is saturated and structurally fragmented—especially when evidence alternates among several coalitions—causing a weakly weighted majority comparison. Thus, equal conflict counts can produce different strategies, while different counts such as k=7 and k=9 can produce the same strategy when their relational organization is alike. Compact two-coalition displays preserve strong primacy, whereas fully saturated, fragmented displays elicit majority-sensitive responding. Subject-specific variation in anchor reliability and comparison recruitment produces stable individual differences without outcome learning.

`rationale`:
The model replaces pi_3's global validity-position coherence gate with a representation-based arbitration mechanism. Conflict count alone never selects a strategy. Compact early coalitions and recurring focal roles support anchoring, while saturation and fragmentation jointly recruit comparison. This preserves nearly constant top-cue adherence across Experiment 1's conflict levels, gives the readily chunked five-cue displays in Experiment 8 strong early-coalition choices near the observed 0.845, and sends the fully saturated displays of Experiment 6 toward the opposing majority. The similarly fragmented k=7 and k=9 displays in Experiment 7 both recruit comparison, avoiding pi_5's artificial discontinuity. Experiment 2's scattered coalitions also receive substantial comparative processing, making responses approximately orthogonal to validity-ranked search. Validity only adjusts the reliability of an already selected anchor and has very small weight in comparison, so it cannot promote the late cue in Experiments 3 and 5 or create a validity-distance effect in Experiment 4. Broad subject variation in anchor accuracy and the comparison gate supplies the requested heterogeneity. Unlike a fixed conflict threshold, the theory predicts separable effects of k/n, spatial contiguity, coalition recurrence, and invariant focal placement when k is held constant.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0233 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0233.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is faithful to the prescribed structure-sensitive anchoring-and-comparison family and captures the central cross-experiment pattern. It reproduces strong primacy in Experiment 8 almost exactly (0.8402 versus 0.8446), majority-sensitive responding under full saturation in Experiment 6 (0.0000 versus 0.0005), negligible validity-distance promotion in Experiment 4 (0.0075 versus 0.0042), and essentially no late-validity promotion in Experiments 3 and 5. Experiment 2 also remains approximately orthogonal to validity-ranked search (0.0163 versus -0.0050). The largest residual is Experiment 7: the model predicts a 0.0438 k=7-minus-k=9 difference where humans show 0.0067, indicating that saturation still changes comparison recruitment somewhat too strongly across 0.7 versus 0.9 saturation. Experiment 1 likewise slightly understates the small conflict effect (0.0088 versus 0.0283). These are modest quantitative errors rather than failures of the qualitative mechanism. Between-subject variance is broadly plausible, though primacy in Experiment 8 is too homogeneous (0.0021 versus 0.0066).",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The accepted candidate simultaneously satisfies all four key empirical constraints and has no major experiment-specific reversal. In particular, its residual Experiment 7 difference is small rather than the large discontinuity seen in pi_5, while its Experiment 8 fit is excellent and its validity effects remain appropriately negligible. Further adjustment of saturation gating to eliminate the remaining Experiment 7 gap could readily damage the already accurate anchoring/comparison balance in Experiments 6 and 8. The current discrepancies are therefore within a reasonable quantitative tolerance for an experiment-invariant account, and the structure-sensitive mechanism should be retained."
