# generation_iter_02_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace pi_2 with an accessibility-ordered evidence-search theory. The proposed theory should state that people search cues according to a stable, task-general attentional priority—especially visual position, mapping simplicity, and learned accessibility—and stop when an accessible cue discriminates; communicated validities influence priority only when their mapping onto cue positions is sufficiently salient and easy to maintain. This differs from pi_1 because search order is not assumed to equal descending validity, and it differs from pi_2 because choices are not based on an equal tally of all cues. A concrete initial model should assign each cue a priority combining position/accessibility with a bounded validity contribution, sample or estimate limited cue-mapping fidelity across subjects, and apply a stopping rule at the first discriminating attended cue, with modest lapse noise. In Experiment 1, validity and feature order are perfectly aligned and feature 1 always discriminates, yielding the observed flat top-cue-adherence contrast. In Experiment 2, validities are nonmonotonically mapped to feature positions, so accessibility-ordered choices should be approximately uncorrelated with the validity-ranked winner under the balanced and mirrored schedule, yielding an index near zero without requiring globally random responding. Preserve pi_1 as the clean validity-ordered benchmark so future experiments can distinguish validity priority from accessibility priority by independently manipulating cue position, validity rank, and mapping complexity.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_1` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.000)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, stimulus, history):
    # Paper-faithful Tallying heuristic (Dawes 1979; Gigerenzer &

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=1.0000 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0479 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.0479 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Accessibility-Gated Lexicographic Search: People maintain a stable attentional priority over cues based primarily on visual position and learned accessibility. Communicated validities modify that priority only when the validity-to-position mapping is simple enough to encode and maintain. Mapping simplicity is assessed from how closely validity rank follows display order, while a subject-specific mapping-fidelity parameter limits the influence of this information. On each choice, cues are inspected in descending attentional priority and search stops at the first cue that discriminates. Thus, the rule is neither validity-ordered Take The Best nor an equal tally over all cues. When validity and position are aligned, validity information reinforces the accessible first cue and produces nearly invariant one-cue choices. Under a nonmonotonic mapping, idiosyncratic learned accessibility dominates; different subjects can consequently use different cues while still making systematic, nonrandom choices. A small lapse probability captures response errors.

`rationale`: This is the smallest implementation repair to the accepted candidate. The mechanism, equations, parameterization, cue-order rule, and lapse process are unchanged. The only substantive code edit replaces the failing scipy.stats.spearmanr call with a self-contained NumPy correlation between visual position and the already-computed validity-rank score. Its sign is oriented so that perfectly descending validity by position yields mapping_simplicity = 1, while nonmonotonic mappings receive a weaker gate. The added finite-denominator check also handles degenerate mappings safely. Numeric vector-shape checks and probability normalization remain in place, ensuring that every valid trial produces a finite two-element distribution and allowing both experimental metrics to be scored.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is unscorable in both experiments: both simulated metrics are n/a, whereas each metric is well-defined for the supplied designs. Thus there is no behavioral evidence that the implementation reproduces either the near-flat conflict effect in Experiment 1 or the near-zero validity-ranked agreement in Experiment 2. The most likely cause is a runtime failure in `predict`: it calls `scipy.stats.spearmanr` without importing or otherwise defining `scipy`. A failure on every trial would explain the absence of usable simulated responses. Consequently, the accepted loss of 1.0 should not be interpreted as evidence of empirical fit.
Rationale: Retain the prescribed accessibility-ordered, first-discriminating-cue mechanism, but make the implementation executable and resimulate it. Replace the undeclared SciPy call with a self-contained NumPy rank-correlation calculation, or explicitly import the required function in an allowed location. Also verify that `accessibility_weights` is instantiated as a numeric vector of length `n_features` for every subject and that every non-tied trial returns a valid two-element probability vector. After this repair, require finite metrics for both experiments before tuning substantive parameters. The intended directional targets remain approximately 0.028 in Experiment 1 and -0.005 in Experiment 2; because no candidate estimates were produced, there is currently no basis for recommending changes to mapping fidelity, complexity power, validity strength, or lapse noise.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=1.0000 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0479 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The implementation repair recommended previously was successful: both experiments are now scorable, the loss improved from 1.0000 to 0.0479, and the candidate is faithful to the prescribed accessibility-ordered first-discriminating-cue family. The pooled point estimates are strong. Experiment 1 reproduces the nearly flat conflict effect (0.0038 versus 0.0283), and Experiment 2 reproduces near-zero agreement with validity-ranked search (-0.0183 versus -0.0050), substantially outperforming pi_1 there. However, Experiment 2 reveals a marked consistency failure: the candidate's between-subject variance is 0.0861 versus 0.0051 in the real data, roughly 17 times too large. Thus its near-zero pooled estimate appears to arise from averaging subjects with strongly different validity-agreement tendencies, whereas human subjects individually tend to produce metrics much closer to zero. This likely results from independently sampled accessibility weights over the full [0,1] range combined with deterministic cue ordering and low lapse noise.
Rationale: Keep the current mechanism and the accepted executable repair, but reduce the excessive subject-level polarization in Experiment 2. A suitable in-family adjustment is to add modest trial-level stochasticity to attention order while retaining each subject's stable latent priorities—for example, sample the first discriminating cue using a Plackett-Luce/Gumbel ordering or a softmax over the priorities of discriminating cues, with an attention-temperature parameter. Because Experiment 1 has a large validity-supported priority advantage for cue 1, it should remain nearly lexicographic and flat; under Experiment 2's weak mapping gate, stochastic accessibility search can keep each subject's validity-agreement average near zero rather than relying on cancellation across deterministic idiosyncratic orders. If needed, also narrow the subject-specific accessibility-weight dispersion, but do not simply raise global lapse noise toward random responding. Tune the temperature and accessibility dispersion jointly to preserve the already accurate pooled means while bringing Experiment 2 variance much closer to 0.0051.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0479 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "Accessibility-Gated Stochastic Lexicographic Search: People maintain a stable attentional priority over cues based primarily on visual position and learned accessibility. Communicated validities modify that priority only when the validity-to-position mapping is simple enough to encode and maintain. Mapping simplicity is assessed from how closely validity rank follows display order, while a subject-specific mapping-fidelity parameter limits the influence of this information. On each choice, attention follows a noisy priority ordering and search stops at the first cue that discriminates. Thus, stable priorities guide decisions without imposing an identical deterministic cue order on every trial. When validity and position are aligned, validity information gives the accessible first cue a sufficiently large advantage to produce nearly invariant one-cue choices. Under a nonmonotonic mapping, weak validity gating and modest attentional fluctuations distribute search across accessible cues, producing systematic choices that are approximately orthogonal to validity-ranked search without requiring cancellation between strongly polarized subjects. A small lapse probability captures response errors.",

Accessibility-weight dispersion is also narrowed from [0,1] to [0.48,0.52]. These changes directly address the excessive Experiment 2 between-subject variance by preventing each subject's arbitrary accessibility draw from fixing a highly polarized cue order. They do not turn the model into globally random responding: visual position and stable latent priorities continue to structure each choice. In Experiment 1, the validity-position alignment gives cue 1 a large priority advantage, so stochastic search remains nearly lexicographic; the selected temperature permits only a small increase in lower-cue influence as conflict grows, moving the contrast toward the observed small positive value. In Experiment 2, the weak mapping gate and balanced mirrored schedule make stochastic accessibility-based search approximately orthogonal to the validity-ranked winner within subjects, reducing reliance on cross-subject cancellation."
