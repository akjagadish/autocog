# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace pi_2 with an accessibility-ordered evidence-search theory. The proposed theory should state that people search cues according to a stable, task-general attentional priority—especially visual position, mapping simplicity, and learned accessibility—and stop when an accessible cue discriminates; communicated validities influence priority only when their mapping onto cue positions is sufficiently salient and easy to maintain. This differs from pi_1 because search order is not assumed to equal descending validity, and it differs from pi_2 because choices are not based on an equal tally of all cues. A concrete initial model should assign each cue a priority combining position/accessibility with a bounded validity contribution, sample or estimate limited cue-mapping fidelity across subjects, and apply a stopping rule at the first discriminating attended cue, with modest lapse noise. In Experiment 1, validity and feature order are perfectly aligned and feature 1 always discriminates, yielding the observed flat top-cue-adherence contrast. In Experiment 2, validities are nonmonotonically mapped to feature positions, so accessibility-ordered choices should be approximately uncorrelated with the validity-ranked winner under the balanced and mirrored schedule, yielding an index near zero without requiring globally random responding. Preserve pi_1 as the clean validity-ordered benchmark so future experiments can distinguish validity priority from accessibility priority by independently manipulating cue position, validity rank, and mapping complexity.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Accessibility-Gated Stochastic Lexicographic Search: People maintain a stable attentional priority over cues based primarily on visual position and learned accessibility. Communicated validities modify that priority only when the validity-to-position mapping is simple enough to encode and maintain. Mapping simplicity is assessed from how closely validity rank follows display order, while a subject-specific mapping-fidelity parameter limits the influence of this information. On each choice, attention follows a noisy priority ordering and search stops at the first cue that discriminates. Thus, stable priorities guide decisions without imposing an identical deterministic cue order on every trial. When validity and position are aligned, validity information gives the accessible first cue a sufficiently large advantage to produce nearly invariant one-cue choices. Under a nonmonotonic mapping, weak validity gating and modest attentional fluctuations distribute search across accessible cues, producing systematic choices that are approximately orthogonal to validity-ranked search without requiring cancellation between strongly polarized subjects. A small lapse probability captures response errors.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal in-family edit to the accepted candidate. The mapping-simplicity gate, priority equation, validity contribution, positional contribution, and lapse process are retained. Only the deterministic sorting block is replaced by the marginal choice probabilities implied by a Plackett-Luce/Gumbel cue ordering: among currently discriminating cues, softmax priority determines which one is encountered first. Accessibility-weight dispersion is also narrowed from [0,1] to [0.48,0.52]. These changes directly address the excessive Experiment 2 between-subject variance by preventing each subject's arbitrary accessibility draw from fixing a highly polarized cue order. They do not turn the model into globally random responding: visual position and stable latent priorities continue to structure each choice. In Experiment 1, the validity-position alignment gives cue 1 a large priority advantage, so stochastic search remains nearly lexicographic; the selected temperature permits only a small increase in lower-cue influence as conflict grows, moving the contrast toward the observed small positive value. In Experiment 2, the weak mapping gate and balanced mirrored schedule make stochastic accessibility-based search approximately orthogonal to the validity-ranked winner within subjects, reducing reliance on cross-subject cancellation.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=1.0000 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0479 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0071 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 3 at loss=0.0071.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is unscorable in both experiments: both simulated metrics are n/a, whereas each metric is well-defined for the supplied designs. Thus there is no behavioral evidence that the implementation reproduces either the near-flat conflict effect in Experiment 1 or the near-zero validity-ranked agreement in Experiment 2. The most likely cause is a runtime failure in `predict`: it calls `scipy.stats.spearmanr` without importing or otherwise defining `scipy`. A failure on every trial would explain the absence of usable simulated responses. Consequently, the accepted loss of 1.0 should not be interpreted as evidence of empirical fit.
Rationale: Retain the prescribed accessibility-ordered, first-discriminating-cue mechanism, but make the implementation executable and resimulate it. Replace the undeclared SciPy call with a self-contained NumPy rank-correlation calculation, or explicitly import the required function in an allowed location. Also verify that `accessibility_weights` is instantiated as a numeric vector of length `n_features` for every subject and that every non-tied trial returns a valid two-element probability vector. After this repair, require finite metrics for both experiments before tuning substantive parameters. The intended directional targets remain approximately 0.028 in Experiment 1 and -0.005 in Experiment 2; because no candidate estimates were produced, there is currently no basis for recommending changes to mapping fidelity, complexity power, validity strength, or lapse noise.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=1.0000 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0479 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The implementation repair recommended previously was successful: both experiments are now scorable, the loss improved from 1.0000 to 0.0479, and the candidate is faithful to the prescribed accessibility-ordered first-discriminating-cue family. The pooled point estimates are strong. Experiment 1 reproduces the nearly flat conflict effect (0.0038 versus 0.0283), and Experiment 2 reproduces near-zero agreement with validity-ranked search (-0.0183 versus -0.0050), substantially outperforming pi_1 there. However, Experiment 2 reveals a marked consistency failure: the candidate's between-subject variance is 0.0861 versus 0.0051 in the real data, roughly 17 times too large. Thus its near-zero pooled estimate appears to arise from averaging subjects with strongly different validity-agreement tendencies, whereas human subjects individually tend to produce metrics much closer to zero. This likely results from independently sampled accessibility weights over the full [0,1] range combined with deterministic cue ordering and low lapse noise.
Rationale: Keep the current mechanism and the accepted executable repair, but reduce the excessive subject-level polarization in Experiment 2. A suitable in-family adjustment is to add modest trial-level stochasticity to attention order while retaining each subject's stable latent priorities—for example, sample the first discriminating cue using a Plackett-Luce/Gumbel ordering or a softmax over the priorities of discriminating cues, with an attention-temperature parameter. Because Experiment 1 has a large validity-supported priority advantage for cue 1, it should remain nearly lexicographic and flat; under Experiment 2's weak mapping gate, stochastic accessibility search can keep each subject's validity-agreement average near zero rather than relying on cancellation across deterministic idiosyncratic orders. If needed, also narrow the subject-specific accessibility-weight dispersion, but do not simply raise global lapse noise toward random responding. Tune the temperature and accessibility dispersion jointly to preserve the already accurate pooled means while bringing Experiment 2 variance much closer to 0.0051.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0479 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0071 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

In Experiment 2, it produces the required near-zero\u2014and slightly negative\u2014agreement with validity-ranked search (-0.0104 versus -0.0050), rather than pi_1's strongly positive 0.7113. Its Experiment 2 variance remains somewhat elevated (0.0102 versus 0.0051), but the absolute discrepancy is modest and is a major improvement over the previous candidate's 0.0861. The accepted Plackett\u2013Luce attention adjustment therefore corrected the prior subject-polarization problem without sacrificing Experiment 1.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The aggregate loss of 0.0071 is low, both candidates' point estimates are close to the human values, and the variance pattern is now broadly credible across experiments. In particular, the previously recommended trial-level stochastic ordering and narrowed accessibility dispersion produced an accepted and substantial improvement, reducing Experiment 2 variance by roughly an order of magnitude while moving both point estimates toward their targets. The remaining variance excess in Experiment 2 does not justify another regeneration given the risk of over-tuning two experiments or degrading the excellent Experiment 1 fit. This candidate is sufficiently experiment-invariant to retain."
