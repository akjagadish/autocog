# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_3") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_3" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_3
Rank-Budget Arbitration theory proposes that people initially represent advertised cue validities as an ordered hierarchy and try to make a lexicographic choice using the highest-ranked discriminating cue. Reliable access to that hierarchy is capacity-limited, however. The probability that rank retrieval fails increases smoothly with the observable representational load imposed by the number of available cues and the number of cues that must be compared on the current trial. When rank retrieval succeeds, choice approximates Take The Best and lower-ranked tally direction has little influence. When retrieval fails, cue ranks are compressed into a coarse common category, and the person pools the directions of all discriminating cues with approximately equal weight. Strategy arbitration occurs anew on every trial rather than assigning a person permanently to one heuristic. Individual capacity determines the transition location, gate steepness determines how abrupt it is, evidence sensitivity controls response reliability, and lapses produce occasional uninformed choices. Thus, lexicographic and tally-like rules are limiting regimes of a single adaptive representational mechanism.

**Rationale:** Use 10 experts, placing the observable cue load just above the competing theory's narrow capacity range of 9.7–9.9. Across eight structural conditions, the highest-validity discriminating cue always favors A, while the equally weighted pooled direction always favors B. The number of discriminating cues increases from 3 to 10, with all remaining cues tied. Take The Best therefore predicts exactly the same A-choice probability in every structural condition: Expert 1 is always the first discriminator, and all later evidence is ignored. Rank-Budget Arbitration instead predicts a monotonic decline in A choices as the number of discriminating cues increases. Its observable load rises from 10.075 to 10.250, increasing the probability of switching from the A-favoring lexicographic rule to the B-favoring pooled rule. Importantly, pooled evidence has the same signed value (-1) throughout because that theory sign-compresses the tally, so its predicted gradient is specifically attributable to comparison load rather than tally magnitude. Odd and even conditions alternate pooled margins of one and two where possible, helping distinguish this load gradient from ordinary sensitivity to tally margin. Every condition is also presented with A and B reversed, controlling side bias while preserving the predicted gradient toward the lexicographic winner for TTB and away from it as load rises for Rank-Budget Arbitration. The 16 unique pairs are each repeated six times, yielding 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric records whether the subject's aggregate choices fall above or below chance in following the highest-validity discriminating cue. It is side-invariant because the lexical winner is recomputed after each A/B reversal. TTB predicts positive polarity: response noise can weaken preference for the first discriminator but cannot systematically reverse it. Rank-Budget Arbitration predicts negative polarity because retrieval failure is more likely than not at the designed loads, and its pooled rule favors the option opposite the first cue on every stimulus. The polarity transformation targets this qualitative crossover while suppressing between-subject variation in beta, sensitivity, and lapse that mainly changes the magnitude of preference. It remains meaningful for both pooled data and individual-subject slices.

**Rationale:** This design holds both cue-set size and trialwise comparison load exactly constant: all 10 cues discriminate on every trial, so observable load is always 10.25. With capacity 9.7–9.9 and gate steepness 2.0–2.4, Rank-Budget Arbitration predicts a pooling probability of approximately 0.67–0.79 on every trial. In each of the first eight pairs, the highest-validity cue favors A, so Take The Best predicts one constant A-choice probability regardless of all other ratings. Rank-Budget Arbitration instead predicts three probability plateaus according to the sign-compressed pooled direction. In pairs 1–3, lower-ranked majorities favor B, so pooling conflicts with the lexical cue and A choices should fall below 0.5 because pooling is more probable than rank retrieval. In pairs 4–5, the pooled tally ties, producing an intermediate A-choice probability between 0.5 and the lexical-choice probability. In pairs 6–8, pooling and the lexical cue both favor A, producing the highest A-choice probability. The different tally margins within the conflict class (−8, −6, and −2) and agreement class (+2, +6, and +10) should not produce gradients under the advocated theory because pooled evidence is sign-compressed; they form predicted within-class plateaus. Pairs 9–16 are exact A/B reversals. Thus the diagnostic signature is a reversed three-level conflict/tie/agreement pattern at identical comparison load, versus TTB's single probability level for all eight structures in each orientation. Six repetitions of each of the 16 pairs yield 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This metric is mean choice alignment with the equal-weight cue-majority direction on the 12 non-tie stimulus structures. It ranges from -1 to 1. Crucially, the design contains equal numbers of majority/lexicographic agreement and majority/lexicographic conflict structures, including exact A/B reversals. Under Take The Best, majority-alignment scores are positive on agreement trials and equally negative on conflict trials, so symmetric response noise leaves their expected mean at zero regardless of beta or epsilon. Under Rank-Budget Arbitration, the rank-retrieval component still cancels across those balanced structures, whereas the pooling component aligns choices with the majority in both classes. The resulting expectation is therefore substantially positive, approximately the pooling probability times response reliability. Each subject contributes 72 diagnostic trials, yielding a stable within-subject estimate while excluding tally ties that contain no directional pooling prediction.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

{
  "interpretation": "Across all four experiments, pi_3 is the stronger theory, but it is not task-invariant. In Experiment 2 it predicts the observed majority alignment well (0.5706 predicted versus 0.5200 observed), whereas pi_1 predicts essentially zero (0.0139). Experiment 4 is similarly decisive: pi_3 predicts 0.3675 versus an observed 0.3433, while pi_1 predicts the wrong direction at -0.6767. Experiment 3 is weakly diagnostic because both predictions are near the observed zero slope, although pi_3 is numerically closer. Experiment 1 reverses the conclusion: the observed lexical polarity is uniformly positive across subjects (1.0000, variance 0), exactly matching pi_1 and directly contradicting pi_3's negative prediction. Thus pi_1 cannot explain the robust majority effects in Experiments 2 and 4, while pi_3 explains more experiments but fails sharply when its load gate predicts pooling in Experiment 1. This failure is theoretical rather than a simple parameter problem: Experiments 1 and 2 use the same ten cues, and their highest-load trials have the same nominal observable load, yet behavior is lexically dominated in the tie-rich, variable-density context of Experiment 1 and majority-sensitive in the uniformly saturated context of Experiment 2. Changing pi_3's capacity or gate ranges enough to recover Experiment 1 would undermine its successful predictions for Experiments 2 and 4. Conversely, no reparameterization of pi_1 can generate systematic majority alignment without violating its defining one-reason claim. The evidence therefore supports retaining pi_3 as the current benchmark but replacing pi_1 with a stronger, genuinely distinct competitor.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_1 with a Context-Calibrated Evidence-Encoding theory. The central claim should be that people calibrate an encoding strategy from the recent block-level ecology, rather than always using one cue or arbitrating solely from current-trial load. Tie-rich, sparsely discriminating blocks make the validity hierarchy easy to maintain and promote a persistent ordered-search task set; this yields robust lexical choices in Experiment 1, including occasional dense trials embedded in that context. Blocks in which nearly every cue repeatedly discriminates encourage a compressed relational or gist representation, so cue directions are pooled and majority effects emerge, as in Experiment 2. Dense conflict structures should likewise produce the majority preference in Experiment 4, while mixed or tie-rich environments can yield the negligible tally modulation seen in Experiment 3. The model should include a slowly updated contextual state based on recent discrimination density, tie prevalence, and possibly stability of the cue-ranking shortcut; subject-specific thresholds or learning rates can capture the elevated observed variance in Experiment 2. Conditional on the contextual state, choices can interpolate between lexicographic and approximately equal-direction pooling, with sensitivity and lapse noise. This differs from pi_1 by allowing genuine multi-cue influence and differs from pi_3 by making arbitration history- and context-dependent rather than a memory-failure gate determined anew by cue count and current comparison load. A critical future test should present identical diagnostic trials inside sparse versus saturated filler blocks: the new theory predicts context-dependent reversals, whereas pi_1 predicts invariant lexical choice and pi_3's current implementation predicts identical choices for identical trials."
