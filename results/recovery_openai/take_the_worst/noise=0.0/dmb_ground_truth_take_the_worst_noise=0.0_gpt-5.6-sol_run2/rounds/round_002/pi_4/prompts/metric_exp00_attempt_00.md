## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** Use nine experts, placing every trial below Rank-Budget Arbitration's capacity range while making the entire experienced ecology maximally dense. All nine cues discriminate on every trial, so Rank-Budget Arbitration's observable load is fixed at 9.25. Given capacity 9.7–9.9 and gate steepness 2.0–2.4, it predicts only about 0.17–0.29 pooling, with no history or serial-position effect. In each base pair, the highest-validity cue favors A, but exactly five of nine cues favor B; hence lexicographic and pooled representations conflict. Rank-Budget Arbitration should therefore continue choosing the lexicographic winner A on substantially more than half of base trials (approximately 0.58 or higher across its parameter ranges, including lapses). Ecological Encoding Hysteresis instead accumulates a discrimination density of 1.0 on every trial. Despite its sparse prior, its context estimate crosses the 0.68–0.71 threshold within the first few dense comparisons and approaches saturated compression of 0.68–0.76. It consequently predicts a rapid early shift toward the majority winner B and an asymptotic A-choice probability of roughly 0.26–0.40. Thus the primary dissociation is a categorical reversal after context acquisition: persistent lexicographic-majority A choices under Rank-Budget Arbitration versus majority B choices under Ecological Encoding Hysteresis. A secondary diagnostic is serial position: only the advocated theory predicts an early transition, while the competitor is stationary because every trial has identical load. Eight lower-cue permutations prevent reliance on a single memorized display while preserving all theoretically relevant quantities; eight exact A/B reversals balance response side. Each of the 16 pairs is repeated six times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Ecological Encoding Hysteresis theory claims that decision makers learn how to encode an entire block of comparisons. They begin with a sparse-ecology prior favoring maintenance of the advertised validity hierarchy. After each comparison, they update a slowly changing estimate of the proportion of cues that discriminate. When discrimination remains sparse and ties are common, cue ranks remain cognitively useful and an ordered-search task set persists: the highest-validity discriminating cue controls choice, even on an occasional dense trial. When comparisons repeatedly contain many simultaneous discriminations, maintaining separate cue ranks becomes inefficient. People then compress cue directions into a relational gist and approximately pool them with equal weights. A steep contextual transition and a ceiling on compression implement hysteresis-like persistence rather than trial-by-trial load arbitration. Individual differences in the contextual threshold, prior strength, compression ceiling, sensitivity, and lapses produce heterogeneous behavior near the transition. Thus, identical diagnostic comparisons can elicit lexical choices in sparse filler blocks but majority choices in saturated filler blocks.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Rank-Budget Arbitration theory proposes that people initially represent advertised cue validities as an ordered hierarchy and try to make a lexicographic choice using the highest-ranked discriminating cue. Reliable access to that hierarchy is capacity-limited, however. The probability that rank retrieval fails increases smoothly with the observable representational load imposed by the number of available cues and the number of cues that must be compared on the current trial. When rank retrieval succeeds, choice approximates Take The Best and lower-ranked tally direction has little influence. When retrieval fails, cue ranks are compressed into a coarse common category, and the person pools the directions of all discriminating cues with approximately equal weight. Strategy arbitration occurs anew on every trial rather than assigning a person permanently to one heuristic. Individual capacity determines the transition location, gate steepness determines how abrupt it is, evidence sensitivity controls response reliability, and lapses produce occasional uninformed choices. Thus, lexicographic and tally-like rules are limiting regimes of a single adaptive representational mechanism.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

Rank-Budget Arbitration has no history dependence at the fixed load and retains a substantially larger lexicographic component, which favors the opposite option on every trial. Using 88 late trials per subject provides a large categorical gap while keeping binomial between-subject noise low."
