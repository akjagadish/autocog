# feedback_iter_04

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_4`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_5`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with a new graded conflict-compression theory. The new theory should posit competition between an advertised-rank route and an equal-direction aggregation route, but route accessibility should depend jointly on (a) slowly learned block density, (b) the current and recent normalized tally margin, and (c) aggregate validity support on each side. Dense blocks should make cue counting or compression chronically accessible, preserving pi_4's success in Experiment 1, while a sufficiently large and salient majority margin should recruit aggregation even in a sparse block, explaining Experiment 8. Small anti-leader margins should normally leave rank-based processing dominant, explaining Experiments 2 and 5. Validity dominance may continuously bias evidence but must not operate as pi_5's near-veto safeguard, because a perfectly valid leader was frequently rejected in Experiment 1. Recurrence of cue identities should have little or no independent effect without outcome feedback; at most, repetition may reduce the processing cost of an already useful tally representation. The model should preserve continuous tally magnitude rather than sign-normalizing it, allow subject-level thresholds and sensitivities to explain heterogeneous intermediate behavior, and include slow contextual persistence without making density the sole control variable. Critical future tests should orthogonally manipulate density, tally margin, aggregate validity imbalance, and coalition recurrence. The new theory should predict strong effects of density and margin, an interaction between them, graded validity effects, and little recurrence-specific acquisition when density, margin, and validity support are matched.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Contextual Margin Arbitration theory proposes that people maintain two competing representations of binary-feature comparisons. The advertised-rank route retrieves the most valid discriminating expert and favors its option. The conflict-compression route represents all discriminating experts as a directional tally while retaining the tally's graded normalized magnitude. Accessibility of compression is jointly controlled by a slowly persistent estimate of block density, the current normalized majority margin, a recency-weighted trace of recent margins, and the aggregate advertised-validity support for the current majority. Dense blocks make compression chronically accessible, whereas sparse blocks require a clearly suprathreshold majority to overcome rank processing. Density and margin provide compensatory routes to compression, so their overlap does not produce a superadditive accessibility boost. Aggregate validity shifts route accessibility and evidence continuously, but its opposition is released differently by chronic density and momentary margin: dense context strongly reduces validity opposition, whereas margin-driven release is weaker and retains a nonzero residual. Thus, even a salient majority does not automatically erase a strongly dominant advertised expert. Repetition of particular cue identities has no independent learning effect because choices receive no correctness feedback. Stable individual differences in contextual thresholds, margin thresholds, gating sensitivities, evidence precision, and lapses generate heterogeneous intermediate behavior.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal revision of the accepted candidate. The compensatory overlap correction, normalized graded tally, contextual traces, and response equations are retained. The fixed softplus smoothness is replaced by a sharply bounded subject-level margin_smoothness, while the margin threshold is moved slightly upward; a 0.20 margin therefore contributes almost no accessibility in Experiment 8, but the larger margins in Experiment 6 remain strongly suprathreshold. The density threshold is also raised modestly while above-threshold density sensitivity is increased, suppressing medium-density Experiment 1 contexts but strengthening chronic compression in the genuinely dense blocks of Experiments 2, 5, and 7. Finally, the single validity-release rate is split into strong density-specific release and weaker margin-specific release with a nonzero floor. Dense blocks can consequently overcome opposing advertised validity, whereas a momentarily large margin leaves a graded residual when the advertised leader is highly dominant. This targets lower coalition effects in Experiments 1 and 8 and higher majority choice in Experiments 2 and 5–7 without globally changing tally precision or introducing recurrence learning.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.3486 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2749 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.2571 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4: loss=0.2474 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2453 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 5 at loss=0.2453.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed graded arbitration family and improves substantially over the old pi_5 pattern in Experiments 1, 3, and 8. It correctly preserves lexical dominance in Experiment 3 and predicts little recurrence-specific coalition acquisition in Experiment 8. However, it is not experiment-invariant. It is strongly too rank-dominant in Experiment 2 (-0.578 versus 0.343), Experiment 5 (0.303 versus 0.577), Experiment 6 (0.151 versus 0.830), and Experiment 7 (0.301 versus 0.640). These are directional, not merely quantitative, failures in Experiment 2 and very large underpredictions elsewhere. Conversely, it modestly overpredicts tally alignment in Experiment 4 (0.670 versus 0.520) and produces too much tally-dependent slope in Experiment 1 (0.066 versus 0.001). The central problem is the gate geometry: signed linear density_excess imposes a severe penalty in sparse displays, so even conspicuous normalized margins cannot recruit compression in Experiment 6. Meanwhile, small margins are penalized even in maximally dense blocks, preventing the chronic compression required in Experiments 5 and 7. Thus density and margin currently act more like conjunctive requirements than compensatory routes to accessibility.
Rationale: Keep the advertised-rank versus graded conflict-compression theory, but recalibrate the accessibility gate. Replace the large signed density penalty with an asymmetric density bonus, such as sensitivity times max(context_density - threshold, 0), or otherwise cap the below-threshold penalty. Likewise, avoid strongly penalizing margins below threshold; use a hinge or nonlinear salience term so that dense context alone can sustain compression in Experiments 5 and 7, while a sufficiently large margin can overcome sparse density in Experiment 6. Increase the leverage of above-threshold current margin relative to recent-margin persistence, while retaining little or no cue-identity recurrence effect. Preserve low compression for the moderate-margin, subthreshold-density displays of Experiment 8 through the base gate and graded validity opposition rather than a density veto. Because broader compression would otherwise worsen Experiment 4 and the residual slope in Experiment 1, jointly lower or narrow tally_sensitivity so route access can rise without making every compressed choice nearly deterministic; raw tally magnitude should still be preserved. The next fit should specifically target higher compression probability in dense small-margin trials and sparse large-margin trials, not a global increase in compression. This should raise Experiments 2, 5, 6, and 7 while limiting the existing overprediction in Experiments 1 and 4.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.3486 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2749 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision improved aggregate loss and moved Experiments 2, 5, 6, and 7 in the intended direction, confirming that the previous signed, conjunctive gate was a problem. It remains faithful to the prescribed graded rank-versus-compression family, and it fits Experiment 3 exactly and Experiment 8 closely. Nevertheless, it is not yet experiment-invariant. Experiment 2 remains directionally wrong (-0.337 versus 0.343), Experiment 6 still severely underpredicts majority choice (0.429 versus 0.830), and Experiment 7 remains low (0.472 versus 0.640). Experiment 5 is now reasonably close but still low (0.499 versus 0.577). At the same time, the revision substantially worsened Experiment 1's tally-dependent slope (0.206 versus 0.001) and Experiment 4's tally alignment (0.734 versus 0.520). Thus another global increase in compression would be counterproductive. The likely remaining problem is that validity opposition is still an additive gate penalty and can function as a de facto veto precisely on anti-leader trials, despite the verbal theory denying a veto. In addition, using unscaled raw tally as compressed evidence makes evidence strength depend strongly on feature count and can double-count margin through both the gate and the choice stage, contributing to excessive tally effects in Experiments 1 and 4.
Rationale: Keep the current mechanism family and build on the accepted positive-part gate, since that previous change was beneficial. The next revision should not simply raise density_sensitivity, margin_sensitivity, or baseline access globally. Instead, make negative validity support lose influence smoothly when either contextual density or majority margin is high: for example, bound the negative validity-access contribution and attenuate it as density_excess or margin salience grows, while retaining its full graded effect for moderate-density, small-margin cases such as Experiment 8. This should release compression in dense Experiments 2 and 7 and in the large-margin trials of Experiment 6 without destroying the good Experiment 8 fit. Replace the hard margin cliff with a smooth hinge or softplus near the threshold so Experiment 2's near-threshold margins are not treated like negligible margins. Finally, normalize compressed tally evidence for the number of discriminating cues, or use a monotone sublinear transform such as signed normalized margin times a calibrated scale; this preserves continuous magnitude while reducing feature-count-driven overconfidence and the excessive effects in Experiments 1 and 4. Retune tally sensitivity upward only as needed after that rescaling. The target is selective accessibility plus calibrated evidence: raise Experiments 2, 6, and 7, preserve Experiment 8, and bring Experiments 1 and 4 back down.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2749 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.2571 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed graded rank-versus-compression family, and both prior revisions were accepted, so the positive-part accessibility gate, smooth margin term, validity release, and normalized tally representation are productive foundations. The current revision further improves Experiments 2, 5, 6, and 7 while preserving the exact qualitative result in Experiment 3. Experiment 8 is still reasonably close, although it has drifted upward from 0.179 to 0.211 against 0.163. The fit is nevertheless not experiment-invariant. Experiment 2 remains directionally wrong (-0.156 versus 0.343), Experiment 6 remains severely too rank-dominant (0.522 versus 0.830), and Experiments 5 and 7 still underpredict majority choice (0.508 versus 0.577 and 0.503 versus 0.640). Most importantly, Experiment 1 has deteriorated monotonically across accepted iterations: its tally-dependent slope is now 0.290 versus essentially zero in humans. Experiment 4 also remains too tally-aligned (0.659 versus 0.520). Thus the model simultaneously underuses compression in the diagnostic dense-small-margin and sparse-large-margin conditions, yet overexpresses tally evidence when density and margin are jointly salient. The positive density-by-margin product is likely central: it makes the two intended alternative routes to compression superadditive, even though the empirical pattern calls for compensatory, approximately OR-like recruitment. A second issue is that validity opposition is released in the accessibility gate but remains fully present in compressed_delta, allowing advertised validity to continue suppressing anti-leader majorities after compression has ostensibly won arbitration.
Rationale: Build on the accepted changes rather than reversing them, but revise the interaction geometry. Replace the strictly positive density_margin_interaction with a saturating or compensatory combination of density and margin—such as a noisy-OR, capped sum, log-sum-exp/max-like combination, or a small negative overlap correction. Density alone should recruit compression in Experiments 2, 5, and 7, and margin alone should recruit it in Experiment 6, without an extra boost when both are already salient. This should reduce the excessive tally effects in Experiments 1 and 4 while permitting modest upward retuning of the separate density and margin routes. Also propagate the existing salience-dependent validity release into compressed evidence: once compression is strongly accessible, opposing validity should remain a graded residual bias rather than again entering compressed_delta at full validity_evidence_gain. Keep that attenuation weak in moderate-density, small-margin displays to avoid further increasing Experiment 8. Finally, modestly narrow the effective product of tally_evidence_scale and tally_sensitivity if Experiment 1 and Experiment 4 remain high; do not globally increase baseline compression. The target is selective improvement: flip Experiment 2 positive, substantially raise Experiment 6 and moderately raise Experiments 5 and 7, while bringing Experiment 1 sharply toward zero and Experiment 4 toward 0.52 without losing Experiment 3 or the near-fit in Experiment 8.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.2571 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.2474 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current revision was accepted and modestly improves aggregate fit, so the compensatory overlap correction and released compressed-validity term are useful. In particular, Experiment 4 moved toward the data (0.617 versus 0.520), and Experiments 5–7 also improved. The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed rank-versus-graded-compression family and preserves the pooled qualitative result in Experiment 3. It is nevertheless not experiment-invariant. Experiment 1 is the largest structural failure: the predicted tally-dependent TTB-agreement slope is 0.293 versus essentially zero, and this error has increased monotonically from 0.066 across accepted iterations. Experiment 2 is still directionally wrong (-0.222 versus +0.343). Majority choice also remains too low in Experiments 6 (0.588 versus 0.830) and 7 (0.516 versus 0.640), with a smaller shortfall in Experiment 5 (0.525 versus 0.577). Meanwhile Experiment 8 has deteriorated to 0.261 versus 0.163. This pattern indicates insufficient discrimination around the accessibility thresholds: the softplus margin term gives appreciable compression drive even just below threshold, helping the fixed 0.20 anti-leader margin in Experiment 8 and likely contributing to Experiment 1, while compression remains insufficient in genuinely dense blocks and on conspicuously large-margin trials. The current validity release also treats density and margin as interchangeable sources of attenuation, which may release a highly dominant opposing leader too readily in medium-density, high-margin Experiment 1 displays.
Rationale: Keep the accepted compensatory gate geometry rather than revisiting the interaction overhaul; that change lowered loss and improved Experiment 4. The next revision should instead increase contrast between near-threshold and clearly suprathreshold accessibility. Make the margin hinge substantially sharper or parameterize its smoothness, so a margin near 0.20 contributes almost no drive while large margins in Experiment 6 still contribute strongly. Likewise, use a steeper, more selective density transition: suppress medium-density Experiment 1 contexts but strengthen access in the genuinely dense blocks of Experiments 2, 5, and 7. This can be accomplished by modestly raising the density threshold while increasing above-threshold density sensitivity, rather than raising baseline compression. Separate density-driven from margin-driven validity release instead of using their unweighted sum. Dense context may strongly attenuate opposing validity, helping Experiments 2 and 7, whereas margin alone should leave a larger graded residual when aggregate validity opposition is extreme. A nonzero attenuation floor or weaker margin-specific release would reduce the excessive Experiment 1 slope and Experiment 8 coalition capture without restoring a categorical veto. Do not globally lower tally precision yet, because Experiment 6 still needs substantially stronger majority choice. The selective targets are: sharply reduce Experiments 1 and 8, flip Experiment 2 positive, and raise Experiments 5–7 while retaining the improved Experiment 4 fit and lexical polarity in Experiment 3.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.2474 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2453 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

  "interpretation": "The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed graded rank-versus-compression family, and the latest revision was accepted, but the improvement in aggregate loss is very small. The sharper margin transition successfully repaired Experiment 8 (0.171 versus 0.163), while Experiment 5 is now close (0.553 versus 0.577) and Experiment 4 continues to improve (0.593 versus 0.520). Experiment 3 is also exactly correct. However, the revision worsened several central tests: Experiment 1 rose further to 0.316 versus 0.001, Experiment 2 moved backward to -0.329 versus +0.343, and Experiment 6 fell to 0.562 versus 0.830. Experiment 7 remains low at 0.524 versus 0.640. Thus the model is still strongly rank-dominant in dense Experiments 2 and 7 and on the salient-majority trials of Experiment 6, while paradoxically producing far too much tally-dependent behavior in Experiment 1. The latest threshold sharpening should not simply be repeated: although accepted overall, it mainly fixed Experiment 8 and modestly improved Experiments 4 and 5 while aggravating Experiments 1, 2, and 6. A likely remaining problem is that the model discards useful information about the extremity of validity imbalance. Diagnosticity is hard-capped at 3 and then reduced to a normalized signed average, so a uniquely near-perfect leader is not adequately distinguished from ordinary aggregate opposition. Accessibility is consequently being separated mostly by density and margin thresholds, which cannot discriminate the high-margin trials of Experiments 1 and 6 in the required direction.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the compensatory arbitration architecture, normalized graded tally, contextual persistence, and absence of recurrence learning. Try a different in-family calibration rather than further sharpening both thresholds. First, represent aggregate validity imbalance with a smooth graded dominance statistic that preserves extreme advertised-validity differences; replace the hard diagnosticity cap with a smooth saturation or compute a separate bounded side-support imbalance before normalization. Use that statistic to make the residual opposition after margin-driven release increase continuously with the extremity of anti-majority validity support. This must remain a graded bias, not a veto, but it should distinguish Experiment 1's near-perfect opposing leader from less extreme large-margin conflicts such as Experiment 6. Second, partially undo the latest upward density-threshold move\u2014choose an intermediate threshold or a smooth density hinge centered between the iteration-4 and iteration-5 settings. The last move backward on density coincided with the large deterioration in Experiment 2; dense blocks in Experiments 2, 5, and 7 need more reliable chronic compression without raising global baseline access. Third, consider a mildly convex continuous transform of normalized tally magnitude in the compressed evidence equation, with its scale recalibrated: this can strengthen conspicuously large margins in Experiment 6 while leaving the small margins in Experiments 5, 7, and 8 dependent mainly on chronic density. Do not globally increase tally sensitivity or margin accessibility, which would further worsen Experiment 1 and Experiment 4. The next revision should primarily recover Experiment 2, raise Experiments 6 and 7, and sharply reduce Experiment 1 while preserving the newly accurate Experiment 8 and near-fit in Experiment 5."
