# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** Use 12 experts with one exceptionally dominant advertised leader (100%) and substantially weaker lower experts (60% down to 50%). Every comparison is maximally dense: all 12 cues discriminate. The highest-validity cue favors one option, four lower cues support that leader, and seven lower cues oppose it, so ordered search selects the leader's option while equal-weight pooling selects the opposite option by a 7-to-5 majority. The lower-cue membership rotates across 24 distinct displays, and leader direction is balanced across 12 A-leading and 12 B-leading displays. With four repetitions per pair, this yields 96 trials. Ecological Encoding Hysteresis depends on global discrimination density, which is identically 1.0 throughout. Even under its strongest sparse prior, its context estimate crosses threshold within approximately three displays and then approaches its 0.68-0.76 pooling ceiling. It therefore predicts an early transition followed by only about 0.26-0.39 choices of the highest-validity-cue winner; because lexical and pooled signs and density are held constant, its asymptotic leader-choice probability should be nearly invariant across lower-cue permutations. Relational Coalition Consolidation instead gives the 100% leader an unusually large validity-dominance score: its reliability is 1.0 versus at most 0.20 for any lower cue, producing dominance 0.80, above the entire safeguard threshold range. Its rank safeguard should consequently preserve majority choice of the leader's option even if some recurring lower coalitions become accessible. Rotating which lower cues oppose the leader also limits consolidation of a single exclusive coalition. The primary diagnostic is thus an asymptotic choice reversal: majority-option choices under Ecological Encoding Hysteresis versus dominant-leader choices under Relational Coalition Consolidation. Secondary diagnostics are the advocated theory's rapid serial-position transition and permutation plateau, versus the competitor's persistent leader bias with possible graded variation across permutations because its coalition evidence retains lower-cue validity weights.

**Computed schedule:** 24 unique pairs × 4 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Ecological Encoding Hysteresis theory claims that decision makers learn how to encode an entire block of comparisons. They begin with a sparse-ecology prior favoring maintenance of the advertised validity hierarchy. After each comparison, they update a slowly changing estimate of the proportion of cues that discriminate. When discrimination remains sparse and ties are common, cue ranks remain cognitively useful and an ordered-search task set persists: the highest-validity discriminating cue controls choice, even on an occasional dense trial. When comparisons repeatedly contain many simultaneous discriminations, maintaining separate cue ranks becomes inefficient. People then compress cue directions into a relational gist and approximately pool them with equal weights. A steep contextual transition and a ceiling on compression implement hysteresis-like persistence rather than trial-by-trial load arbitration. Individual differences in the contextual threshold, prior strength, compression ceiling, sensitivity, and lapses produce heterogeneous behavior near the transition. Thus, identical diagnostic comparisons can elicit lexical choices in sparse filler blocks but majority choices in saturated filler blocks.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Relational Coalition Consolidation theory proposes that people retain the advertised validity hierarchy while also learning recurring relationships among lower-ranked cues. On each encounter, the learner represents lower cues relative to the highest-validity discriminating cue and records which cues jointly oppose that leader. Repeated, internally coherent opposition patterns become relational chunks: their accessibility increases with recurrence, pairwise co-opposition, consensus, and repeated conflict with the leading cue. Accessibility changes gradually and exhibits hysteresis, so an established coalition remains available across occasional mismatching trials while an isolated coalition does not immediately displace rank-based processing. Decision evidence is a continuous competition between a graded rank signal, strengthened by advertised validity dominance, and a graded coalition signal reflecting the validity-weighted direction of lower cues. Coalition magnitude is compressed so that learned accessibility, rather than the raw size of the current tally margin, carries more of the influence. Cue count alone therefore does not cause pooling. Many cues can preserve lexical dominance when their coalitional membership rotates, whereas a smaller but recurrent and coherent anti-leader coalition can capture choice. An unusually dominant advertised leader additionally retains a bounded residual influence, preventing complete coalition capture without globally suppressing ordinary coalition learning. The account predicts order-dependent acquisition, persistence after coalition reversals, and different choices for identical displays following stable versus unstable coalition histories.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "The metric is the post-initialization proportion of choices favoring the option supported by the unweighted majority of experts. On every designed display, that option is opposed to the winner of the perfectly valid leading cue. Ecological Encoding Hysteresis should rapidly enter its dense-ecology compressed regime and therefore produce a high, stable majority-choice rate across the remaining 92 trials. Relational Coalition Consolidation's dominance safeguard should instead preserve the leading-cue option, producing a much lower rate. Dropping only the first four trials removes the advocated theory's short and parameter-sensitive transition while retaining enough Bernoulli observations per subject to keep between-subject variance small. The statistic is an ordinary observable choice contrast rather than a direct readout of either theory's latent variables."
