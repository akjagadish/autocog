# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

**Rationale:** Eight validity-ranked cues create a controlled tally-margin series while holding Take The Best's decision basis constant. In the first eight pairs, the highest-validity cue always favors A, so TTB predicts the same A-choice probability on every pair, regardless of the other seven cues. Across those pairs, however, A wins m = 1,...,8 cues, producing tally differences of -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Tallying therefore predicts strong B choices for m=1 to 3, exact guessing at m=4, and increasingly confident A choices for m=5 to 8. In particular, the m=4 pair gives a sharp dissociation: TTB favors A while Tallying predicts exactly 0.5 for any beta and epsilon. The final eight pairs swap A and B, preserving the theoretical contrasts while controlling response-side bias. Thus TTB predicts a flat choice function conditional on the top cue's direction, whereas Tallying predicts a steep monotonic function of the number of cue wins. With 16 unique pairs, each is repeated six times for 96 total trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is a response-side-balanced, evidence-matched interaction contrast. It measures whether adherence to the highest-validity cue changes when the equal-weight tally supports rather than opposes that cue. Trials are matched at absolute tally margins 2, 4, and 6, and the A/B-reversed versions control response bias. Take The Best predicts approximately zero: its probability of following the top cue is the same in congruent and conflicting cells, so beta, lapse rate, and general response reliability largely cancel within subject. Tallying predicts a large positive value: on congruent trials it tends to follow the top cue, whereas on matched conflicting trials it tends to reject it. Averaging across many repetitions and three matched margins should yield substantially lower between-subject variance than a raw choice-rate measure.

**Rationale:** This design orthogonally contrasts the direction of the overall tally with the direction of the first validity-ranked discriminating cue. Every pair contains exactly three discriminating cues. In trials 1-6, A wins two cues and B wins one, so Tallying predicts the same A-choice probability on every trial: epsilon/2 + (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta). However, the first discriminating cue occurs successively at validity ranks 1 through 6 and alternates between favoring A and favoring B. Take The Best therefore predicts alternating high and low A-choice probabilities even though the tally is unchanged. Trials 7-12 swap A and B, balancing response side and reversing both predictions. Across all 12 pairs, tally direction and TTB direction are balanced: the theories agree on six pairs and directly conflict on six. Thus evidence for Tallying is a two-level choice pattern determined solely by the 2-versus-1 cue majority, invariant to stopping rank and the top discriminating cue; TTB instead predicts choices grouped by that first discriminating cue. With 12 unique pairs, each pair is repeated eight times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is the signed rate of following the tally winner, restricted to the six stimulus pairs on which Tallying and Take The Best make opposite predictions. A choice matching the tally majority contributes +1 and a choice matching the first discriminating cue contributes -1. Thus Tallying predicts a positive value, approximately 2q-1, whereas TTB predicts a negative value, approximately -(2q-1), where q is the noisy probability of implementing the relevant heuristic. Agreement trials are excluded because they add sampling noise without adding between-theory information. Each subject supplies 48 diagnostic observations, and the conflict set is balanced across A and B tally winners, limiting variance from response-side bias.

  "interpretation": "Neither fixed heuristic is task-invariant. In Experiment 1, the observed contrast (-0.0300) is almost exactly pi_1's prediction (-0.0167; absolute error 0.0133) and is radically inconsistent with pi_2's prediction (0.8033; error 0.8333). The observed between-subject variance (0.0056) also closely matches pi_1 (0.0052) and is much lower than pi_2's simulated variance (0.0243). Thus, when all eight cues discriminate and tally support varies, behavior is effectively invariant to the tally and follows the highest-validity cue. In Experiment 2, the result reverses: the observed metric (0.6683) closely matches pi_2 (0.7008; error 0.0325), whereas pi_1 predicts the wrong sign and is extremely distant (-0.6542; error 1.3225). Thus, when only three cues discriminate, participants follow the cue majority even when it opposes the first validity-ranked cue. Parameter retuning cannot reconcile this crossover while preserving either theory's description. Increasing noise in TTB could move its Experiment 2 prediction toward zero but not produce a strongly positive tally-aligned result; increasing noise in Tallying could suppress its Experiment 1 contrast toward zero only by also suppressing its successful Experiment 2 prediction. The results therefore indicate a systematic change in information-processing rule rather than a poorly calibrated beta or lapse rate. Across the two experiments pi_2 has the smaller total point-estimate discrepancy, so it should be retained as the stronger fixed-rule benchmark, but it still fails decisively in Experiment 1.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_1 with a capacity-adaptive evidence-selection theory rather than another fixed TTB implementation. The new theory should propose that people first assess the amount of discriminating information in the option pair. When only a small, cognitively manageable number of cues discriminate, they integrate those cues using an approximately equal-weight majority rule; when many cues discriminate and exhaustive comparison becomes costly, they compress the decision by consulting validity-ranked cues lexicographically, often stopping at the first discriminating cue. This prospective gate explains both findings using an observable task property: Experiment 2 has three discriminating cues and elicits tallying, whereas Experiment 1 has eight discriminating cues and elicits lexicographic choice. Implement the gate as a fixed-capacity or smoothly probabilistic function of the number or proportion of discriminating cues, with a cross-experiment capacity parameter, not as an experiment-specific switch. Retain ordinary response noise only after strategy selection. The theory should make falsifiable transition predictions by crossing diagnostic-cue count (for example, 2 through 8) with conflicts between the highest-validity cue and the tally, while holding feature count, validity profile, and tally margin constant. It should predict majority-based behavior below the capacity boundary, increasing top-cue dominance above it, and an intermediate mixture near the boundary. This differs from both current theories by treating frugality as an adaptive response to comparison load rather than an invariant decision rule."
