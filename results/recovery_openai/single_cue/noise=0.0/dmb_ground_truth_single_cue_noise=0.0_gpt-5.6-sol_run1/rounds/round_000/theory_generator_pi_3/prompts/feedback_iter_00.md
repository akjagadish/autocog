# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace pi_1 with a last-reason or recency-overwrite theory. Under this account, people scan cues in the displayed descending-validity order but do not stop at the first discrimination. Each later discriminating cue updates or overwrites the provisional choice, so the last discriminating cue—typically the lowest-validity discriminating cue—has disproportionate control. This differs theoretically from both TTB, which terminates at the first reason, and Tallying, which accumulates all reasons equally. It directly predicts anti-TTB choices in Experiment 2 because the final discriminating cue opposes the first in the constructed pairs. It also predicts a positive Experiment-1 contrast: in tally-support conditions the last cue generally favors the TTB winner, whereas in tally-opposition conditions it generally favors the other option. Stochastic overwrite, occasional missed cues, and lapse noise can moderate the deterministic contrast toward the observed 0.4944 while allowing the strong anti-first-cue rate of 0.1938. The new theory should use task-invariant attention/recency parameters rather than experiment-specific switches and should generate joint predictions for both metrics. Before fitting, verify response coding and whether feature presentation order was fixed, since a global coding reversal or display-order mismatch would be an important procedural alternative; if those checks pass, the recency-overwrite account is the strongest new competitor.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Recency-Gated Reason Overwrite theory. People inspect cues sequentially in descending order of instructed validity, but unlike Take The Best they continue after finding a discriminating cue. An attended discriminating cue establishes a provisional choice, and each subsequently attended discriminating cue can overwrite that choice. Consequently, the final attended reason has disproportionate control, especially when overwrite probability is high. Occasional failures to attend a cue preserve an earlier reason, while response lapses dilute otherwise strong recency effects. Repeated cues favoring the same option stabilize that option indirectly because any one of them can become the retained reason. The mechanism is task-invariant: validity determines scan order, whereas attention, overwrite, and lapse rates remain fixed for a subject across trials and experiments.

- validities: validities
- cue_attention: [0.95, 1.0]
- overwrite_rate: [0.95, 1.0]
- lapse_rate: [0.35, 0.45]

`rationale`:
The previous TTB model fails because stopping at the first discrimination forces a high Experiment-2 TTB-consistency rate and makes choices insensitive to whether subsequent tally evidence supports or opposes the first cue. The proposed model reverses that commitment architecture: scanning continues, and later discriminating cues probabilistically replace the provisional winner. In Experiment 2, where the final discriminating reason commonly conflicts with the highest-validity reason, high attention and overwrite rates generate the required strong anti-TTB tendency. In Experiment 1, support trials generally end with reasons favoring the TTB winner, whereas opposition trials generally end with reasons favoring the alternative, producing the observed positive support-minus-opposition contrast. Marginalizing over missed and overwritten cues gives deterministic, low-variance probability predictions without injecting simulation noise inside predict. The relatively substantial task-general lapse rate moderates the otherwise nearly deterministic last-reason contrast toward human response levels. This account is distinct from both TTB and tallying: it neither stops after one reason nor sums reasons equally, because the influence of an earlier cue depends on whether later cues overwrite it. The implementation assumes that response 0 denotes A, response 1 denotes B, and that descending instructed validity corresponds to scan order; a coding reversal or mismatch between validity and display order should be checked procedurally rather than absorbed by experiment-specific parameters.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0930 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.0930.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate is faithful to the prescribed recency-overwrite family and captures the qualitative cross-experiment pattern: it produces a positive Experiment-1 contrast and strong anti-TTB behavior in Experiment 2. It is also a major improvement over the reference theories. Quantitatively, however, both metrics remain too high. The Experiment-1 contrast is 0.5929 versus 0.4944, indicating overly deterministic control by the final reason. Experiment-2 TTB consistency is 0.2292 versus 0.1938, indicating slightly insufficient overwrite of the first reason. These discrepancies cannot be fixed by changing lapse alone: more lapse would reduce the Experiment-1 contrast but move Experiment 2 toward 0.5, while less lapse would improve Experiment 2 but exaggerate Experiment 1. The model also understates between-subject variability in both experiments, especially Experiment 1.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Continue tuning within the recency-overwrite family. Keep overwrite of the second discriminating cue near unity, since Experiment 2 commonly pits two discriminating reasons against each other and requires even stronger anti-first-cue behavior. Slightly lower the lapse range to improve Experiment 2. To prevent that change from inflating the Experiment-1 contrast, add a task-invariant update-fatigue or discriminating-cue-count gate: preserve strong overwrite for the first subsequent reason, but modestly reduce attention or overwrite after the second discriminating update. This should selectively soften the near-deterministic last-cue effect on Experiment-1 trials containing many discriminating cues without sacrificing the two-reason reversal central to Experiment 2. Broaden subject-level ranges for lapse and/or fatigue strength to address the substantially underestimated variances. Do not abandon recency overwrite or introduce experiment-specific switches; the accepted candidate has the right mechanism, but its single constant overwrite hazard is too rigid across short and long reason sequences."
