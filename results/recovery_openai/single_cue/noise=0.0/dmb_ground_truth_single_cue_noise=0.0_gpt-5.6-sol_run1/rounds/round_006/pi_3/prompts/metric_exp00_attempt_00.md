# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=6):** [0.95, 0.86, 0.78, 0.69, 0.6, 0.52]

**Trial pairs (n=6):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  trial 4: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

**Rationale:** This is a dense two-block boundary-diversity test at the competing theory's six-reason chunking window. In descending-validity order, the three base sequences are ABBBBB, AAABBB, and AAAAAB; their reversals balance response side. Every trial has six discriminating cues, exactly two coherent opposing runs, and no gaps. Recency-Gated Reason Overwrite predicts the terminal option on every trial. Because discriminating-cue count is always six, all conditions receive the same four-update fatigue factor; terminal-run length may modulate preference strength, but it cannot reverse the predicted terminal choice. The competing ordinal-event theory instead learns that dense two-block boundaries vary widely (first-run fractions 1/6, 3/6, and 5/6). Repetition drives its boundary-diversity statistic toward its maximum, increasing recruitment of the coherent-chunk policy, which preserves the initial commitment. It therefore predicts an increasing initial-option preference as structural context accumulates, ultimately opposing overwrite on all six trial types. The critical quantitative tests are terminal-option choice versus initial-option choice and its interaction with trial history: overwrite predicts stable terminal control apart from random responses, whereas the competitor predicts a history-dependent shift toward primacy as boundary diversity is sampled. Six unique pairs are each repeated 16 times for exactly 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 6 unique pairs × 16 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Recency-Gated Reason Overwrite with Processing Fatigue. People inspect cues sequentially in descending order of instructed validity and continue after finding a discriminating cue. An attended discriminating cue establishes a provisional choice, and each subsequently attended discriminating cue can overwrite that choice. Consequently, the final attended reason has disproportionate control. Occasional failures to attend a cue preserve an earlier reason, while response lapses dilute strong recency effects. In addition, processing more than two discriminating reasons produces task-invariant update fatigue: the retained decision is expressed with progressively lower reliability as the discriminating-cue count increases. This preserves strong second-reason overwrite on short conflicts while moderating near-deterministic last-reason control on longer sequences.

**Parameters:**
- validities: validities
- cue_attention: [0.95, 1.0]
- overwrite_rate: [0.95, 1.0]

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Context-Calibrated Ordinal Event Policies. Decision makers inspect experts in instructed-validity order but encode the resulting discriminating sequence as ordinal events: an initial commitment, coherent directional runs, reversals, and a terminal commitment. Choice is generated by a context-sensitive selection between two subject-stable policies. The default terminal policy expresses the most recently attended commitment, whereas a coherent-chunk policy preserves the initial commitment when a moderately long, densely populated display is naturally represented as two opposing blocks. The chunk policy is recruited by conjunctions of density, coherent run structure, manageable load, and boundary regularities learned across trials—not by raw switch count alone. Sparse late suffixes or isolated terminal opposition foreground the terminal event and increase its confidence, even at high nominal feature counts. Equal-weight tally agreement can strengthen or weaken confidence in an already selected commitment but cannot reverse that commitment. Communicated validities determine inspection order and contribute only a strongly compressed confidence adjustment. Stable individual differences govern attention, recency and primacy propensities, chunk-switch threshold, contextual calibration, response gain, and lapse. In non-foregrounded moderate-load sequences, replacement of an existing commitment is slightly less complete, allowing preceding ordinal commitments to persist without changing policy selection.

Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This is the late-block probability of choosing the option supported by the least-valid (last-inspected) cue, with the six stimulus pairs weighted equally within subjects. Trials before index 24 are excluded so the competitor's boundary-diversity calibration has stabilized. Recency-Gated Reason Overwrite predicts persistently above-chance terminal-choice rates, whereas the competing theory increasingly recruits its coherent-chunk/primacy policy and therefore tends to choose the option opposite the terminal cue. Equal weighting of subject-by-stimulus cells reduces variance from each subject's randomized schedule and side-balanced reversals. The measure is not definitionally guaranteed by overwrite: fatigue, missed cues, and lapses can substantially attenuate terminal control, and the statistic is an observable choice alignment that either theory can predict."
