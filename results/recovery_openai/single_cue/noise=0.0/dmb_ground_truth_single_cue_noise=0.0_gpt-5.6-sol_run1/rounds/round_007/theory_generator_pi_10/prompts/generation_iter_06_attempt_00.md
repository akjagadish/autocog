# generation_iter_06_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_9`).

Replace pi_9 with a stimulus-local bounded arbitration theory. The new theory should propose that people encode a small set of decision objects—an early high-validity commitment, reliability-weighted support from the currently visible coalition, and a privileged terminal reason or terminal run—and arbitrate among them on each trial. Terminal evidence should receive a genuine recency advantage, but its control should be moderated by current-stimulus conflict structure, relative coalition strength, and cue reliability rather than by a learned experiment-level overwrite state. Coherent added evidence should saturate and may produce only a mild vigilance decline, matching the small positive load contrast in Experiment 1 rather than pi_3's strong exponential count fatigue. History effects should be absent or weak carryover effects, consistent with Experiment 2, and should never be the principal source of terminal control. Allow stable subject-level variation in terminal susceptibility, coalition reliance, and lapse or attentional reliability to capture the elevated between-subject variance. This theory differs from pi_3 by rejecting obligatory cue-by-cue overwrite plus task-invariant count fatigue, and differs from pi_9 by rejecting susceptibility-dominant contextual learning and a continuously evolving accumulator as the primary explanation. Its critical predictions should include strong but nonuniform terminal control, near-zero inducer-history covariance, only modest decline under unanimous cue load, and limited effects of physical gaps or switch density unless those features change the perceived terminal run or coalition balance.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.742)

**Description**
Recency-Gated Reason Overwrite with Processing Fatigue. People inspect cues sequentially in descending order of instructed validity and continue after finding a discriminating cue. An attended discriminating cue establishes a provisional choice, and each subsequently attended discriminating cue can overwrite that choice. Consequently, the final attended reason has disproportionate control. Occasional failures to attend a cue preserve an earlier reason, while response lapses dilute strong recency effects. In addition, processing more than two discriminating reasons produces task-invariant update fatigue: the retained decision is expressed with progressively lower reliability as the discriminating-cue count increases. This preserves strong second-reason overwrite on short conflicts while moderating near-deterministic last-reason control on longer sequences.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.640)

**Description**
Validity-Ordered Competitive Evidence Buffer with Conflict-Normalized Readout. Decision makers inspect cues in descending order of instructed validity and encode every discriminating cue as signed evidence rather than as a provisional choice or directional chunk. Each newly encoded reason causes graded displacement of all earlier traces in a capacity-limited working-memory buffer. Displacement becomes stronger as the buffer exceeds its stable subject-specific capacity, but old evidence is never categorically erased. At response, the decision maker sums all surviving validity-scaled traces. Readout normalization depends on the balance of accessible evidence: it is strongest when substantial trace mass supports both options and weak when the accessible buffer contains a coherent majority. Readout uncertainty additionally grows quadratically with capacity overload and receives a count-based attenuation beginning explicitly at seven discriminating reasons, contracting long conflicts toward chance without imposing arrangement-specific effects. Stable individual differences in effective capacity, displacement rate, validity sensitivity, response gain, and conflict normalization generate heterogeneous recency and integration behavior.

### `pi_8` (overall score: 0.612)

**Description**
Context-Calibrated Ordinal Event Policies. Decision makers inspect experts in instructed-validity order but encode the resulting discriminating sequence as ordinal events: an initial commitment, coherent directional runs, reversals, and a terminal commitment. Choice is generated by a context-sensitive selection between two subject-stable policies. The default terminal policy expresses the most recently attended commitment, whereas a coherent-chunk policy preserves the initial commitment when a moderately long, densely populated display is naturally represented as two opposing blocks. The chunk policy is recruited by conjunctions of density, coherent run structure, manageable load, and boundary regularities learned across trials—not by raw switch count alone. Sparse late suffixes or isolated terminal opposition foreground the terminal event and increase its confidence, even at high nominal feature counts. Equal-weight tally agreement can strengthen or weaken confidence in an already selected commitment but cannot reverse that commitment. Communicated validities determine inspection order and contribute only a strongly compressed confidence adjustment. Stable individual differences govern attention, recency and primacy propensities, chunk-switch threshold, contextual calibration, response gain, and lapse.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1988 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1247 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1168 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4: loss=0.1215 -> REJECTED
- iter 5: loss=0.2062 -> REJECTED
- iter 6: loss=0.1315 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 3 at loss=0.1168 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Reliability-Gated Decision-Object Arbitration with Load-Calibrated Terminal Access. People construct at most three bounded objects from each display: an initial high-validity commitment, a reliability-weighted summary of the visible coalition, and a privileged terminal reason or terminal directional run. Arbitration is stimulus-local and history-free. Terminal evidence has a genuine recency advantage, but terminal access is greatest when a coherent reversal occurs within a manageable four-to-six-reason conflict. Very short conflicts provide too little separation for a strongly privileged counterargument, whereas seven-or-more-reason conflicts reduce access through object competition rather than general count fatigue. A singleton terminal counterargument receives additional privilege independently of terminal-run support. Fragmented conflicts continue to impair terminal retrieval. The initial commitment remains a weak but non-negligible fallback, coalition evidence saturates, and unanimous evidence experiences only a modest vigilance decline. Stable variation in terminal susceptibility, coalition reliance, attention, and lapses produces heterogeneous conflict choices without learned context.

`rationale`: This is a minimal refinement of the accepted three-object model. The unconditional two-run multiplier is replaced by a smooth four-to-six-reason access window. It therefore strengthens coherent terminal access in the manageable conflicts emphasized by Experiments 11–13, while weakening the same mechanism in the short conflicts contributing to Experiment 3 and the seven-or-more-reason overload conflicts in Experiment 6. A separate terminal-singleton bonus targets the privileged counterargument in Experiment 11 without broadly rewarding long terminal coalitions. Fragmentation attenuation is modestly strengthened to further reduce excessive terminal control in multi-reversal displays. Early commitment is partially restored, rather than returned to its original strength, to improve Experiments 1, 2, 6, and 9 while preserving the accepted gains in terminal-diagnostic conditions. The terminal-susceptibility range is widened around approximately the same center, allowing low-susceptibility coalition users and high-susceptibility terminal users to coexist and increasing stable between-subject variance, especially in Experiment 4, without mechanically raising mean recency. Vigilance, history independence, and gap insensitivity are otherwise unchanged.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed stimulus-local decision-object family and correctly captures several qualitative invariances: no history covariance in Experiment 16, negligible physical-gap effect in Experiment 14, no practically large switch-density effect in Experiment 7, and reasonably close fits in Experiments 6, 8, and 10. However, the aggregate fit is not yet adequate. Major errors occur in Experiment 5 (mixed-minus-block terminal following 0.230 versus 0.003), Experiment 11 (terminal following 0.467 versus 0.843), Experiment 12 (majority choice 0.493 versus 0.171), and Experiment 13 (terminal following 0.673 versus 0.881). Terminal control is also too strong in Experiment 3 (0.767 versus 0.575) while being too weak in Experiment 4 (0.555 versus 0.665). This opposing pattern shows that a global increase or decrease in terminal susceptibility would not work. The current stimulus-local gate is miscalibrated: terminal reliability relative to the single strongest cue plus net coalition balance does not adequately distinguish coherent two-run conflicts from fragmented conflicts. The early and coalition objects are also too influential: TTB agreement is too high in Experiments 2 and 9, and the tally-support contrast is too large in Experiment 1. Finally, unanimous-load decline is too small in Experiment 15 (0.012 versus 0.047), and several conflict-condition variances are misfit, especially the underpredicted heterogeneity in Experiment 4.
Rationale: Keep the three-object, history-free arbitration architecture, but retune its stimulus-local arbitration. First, do not simply raise terminal_susceptibility: that would worsen Experiment 3. Instead, make coalition moderation depend more explicitly on conflict geometry within the existing object representation. A coherent two-run display or a clearly chunked terminal coalition should moderate the terminal object less than a fragmented, switch-rich conflict. This should raise terminal control in Experiments 11-13 and in the block condition of Experiment 5, while allowing lower terminal control on the more fragmented Experiment 3 displays. The current tiny terminal_run_bonus range is probably insufficient for that distinction; widen it or add a bounded two-run/coherence multiplier, while retaining saturation and keeping the resulting Experiment 7 contrast below its practical threshold. Second, reduce the early object's weight and modestly flatten coalition-balance sensitivity. The early object is currently duplicated inside the all-cue coalition and appears to create the large Experiment 5 arrangement contrast and excessive first-cue influence in Experiments 1, 2, and 9. Consider lowering early_commitment and using a less steep coalition-balance readout rather than broadly suppressing terminal evidence. Third, increase or rescale vigilance_decline enough to reproduce the modest positive Experiment 15 contrast without introducing count fatigue on conflict trials. Broaden subject-level terminal and lapse variation selectively to approach the large Experiment 4 variance, but avoid the already excessive variance in Experiments 5, 6, 11, and 12. These are in-family calibration changes; the core decision-object theory should be retained.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1988 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1247 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision substantially improves the aggregate loss and remains faithful to the prescribed stimulus-local, history-free decision-object family. The prior geometry-based advice was productive: Experiments 4, 5, 10, 12, 13, and 15 all improved, while the desired invariances remain intact in Experiments 7, 14, and 16. Nevertheless, the model is not yet experiment-invariant. Terminal control is still much too strong in Experiment 3 (0.814 versus 0.575) and in the overload conflicts of Experiment 6, where early-option choice is only 0.172 versus 0.307. At the same time it remains too weak in the manageable-load terminal conflicts of Experiment 11 (0.675 versus 0.843), with smaller shortfalls in Experiments 12 and 13. Experiment 1 also deteriorated sharply: its tally-support contrast is 0.771 versus 0.494. Thus, the successful geometry adjustment has become too coarse: the unconditional extra multiplier for every two-run conflict produces excessive terminal dominance at short and overloaded displays but still cannot provide enough terminal access in the diagnostic 5–6-reason conflicts. The reduction of the early object also appears to have overshot, given the now-low TTB rate in Experiment 2, the low early choice in Experiment 6, and the enlarged Experiment 1 contrast. Finally, the mean in Experiment 4 is excellent, but its between-subject variance remains severely compressed (0.009 versus 0.062), contrary to the recommendation's emphasis on stable heterogeneity.
Rationale: Keep the three-object architecture and build on the accepted geometry improvement, but refine rather than globally strengthen terminal recency. Replace the unconditional double two-run amplification with bounded conflict-load-sensitive access: terminal distinctiveness should be strongest for manageable 4–6-reason conflicts, while being weaker for very short conflicts and for 7+ reason overload displays. This is an object-access calibration, not general count fatigue, and should raise Experiments 11–13 while lowering terminal dominance in Experiments 3 and 6. Retain or slightly strengthen fragmentation attenuation for three-or-more-run patterns, because Experiment 3 remains far too recency-driven, but preserve the near-zero practical switch-density result in Experiment 7. Separating a terminal-singleton privilege from terminal-run-length saturation may also help: the present run bonus rewards already-large terminal coalitions too strongly, whereas Experiment 11 requires privileged access to a singleton terminal counterargument. Partially restore early commitment to an intermediate range rather than undoing the prior accepted change wholesale. A modest restoration should improve Experiments 1, 2, 6, and 9, while the refined manageable-load terminal gate can protect Experiments 11–13. Do not further increase vigilance decline; Experiment 15 is already close. Preserve the history-free and gap-insensitive implementation. Finally, widen effective subject heterogeneity without increasing mean terminal dominance—e.g., use less saturated arbitration weights or a subject-specific terminal-versus-coalition mixing temperature—so stable susceptibility differences can express themselves in Experiment 4 rather than being washed out by the currently dominant terminal weight.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1247 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1168 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed stimulus-local, history-free three-object mechanism, and the latest revision was directionally useful: aggregate loss improved from 0.1247 to 0.1168. The load-sensitive gate improved Experiment 3 relative to iteration 2, brought the overload result in Experiment 6 close to the data, and further improved manageable-load terminal control in Experiment 11. The intended invariances are also excellent: Experiment 7 shows no practically large switch-density effect, Experiment 14 has essentially the correct near-zero gap effect, Experiment 16 has only weak history covariance, and Experiment 10 is almost exact. Nevertheless, the model is not yet experiment-invariant. Terminal following remains much too high in Experiment 3 (0.768 versus 0.575), while it remains too low in Experiments 11 (0.721 versus 0.843), 12 (equivalently, majority following is 0.306 versus 0.171), and 13 (0.785 versus 0.881). Experiment 5 also regressed sharply, with a spurious mixed-minus-block arrangement effect of 0.169 versus 0.003. More generally, Experiment 1 still has an excessive tally-support contrast (0.720 versus 0.494), and first-cue influence is too high in Experiments 2 and 9. The partially restored early commitment moved those latter metrics past their targets: iteration 2 was slightly below the Experiment 2 target, whereas iteration 3 is substantially above it. Finally, broad terminal-susceptibility variation increased variance in Experiment 4 but did so indiscriminately: its variance remains too low there (0.023 versus 0.062) while becoming much too high in Experiments 5, 6, and 12.
Rationale: Retain the three bounded decision objects and the successful stimulus-local load gate, but sharpen rather than globally strengthen recency. The current implementation leaves an unconditional run-length multiplier, `1 + 0.25 * terminal_run_bonus * run_saturation`, even when manageable access is near zero. Gate or greatly shrink that residual run bonus outside the manageable conflict window. This should reduce excessive short-conflict recency in Experiment 3 and suppress the unwanted arrangement effect among ten-reason displays in Experiment 5 without imposing general count fatigue. At the same time, strengthen the coherent 5–6-reason peak or singleton privilege within the window to close the remaining deficits in Experiments 11–13. Strengthen fragmentation attenuation for three-or-more-run conflicts as well, since Experiment 3 remains too terminal-driven despite the accepted improvement. Do not globally raise terminal susceptibility. Reduce coalition influence modestly—preferably its balance-dependent slope rather than deleting the coalition object—because the coalition currently produces both the excessive tally modulation in Experiment 1 and excessive majority following in Experiment 12. For early commitment, avoid another oscillation: iteration 2 was too low and iteration 3 too high on Experiment 2, so use a range centered between those two settings rather than repeating either a broad reduction or restoration. Replace the broad susceptibility-range solution to heterogeneity with an in-family ambiguity-sensitive mixing temperature or nonlinear object contest: stable subject differences should be expressed strongly when terminal and coalition objects are closely matched, as in Experiment 4, but compressed when one object clearly dominates, as in Experiments 5, 6, and 12. Vigilance decline should be nudged slightly back toward the iteration-2 calibration, since Experiment 15 has moved from near-target to a modest overprediction. Preserve the history-free implementation and the successful gap and switch-density invariances.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1168 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.1215 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed stimulus-local, history-free decision-object family, and several qualitative invariances are preserved: Experiment 7 shows no practically significant switch-density effect, Experiment 14 remains near zero for physical foregrounding, Experiment 16 shows only weak history covariance, and Experiment 15 now closely matches the modest unanimous-load decline. The revision also improved the means in Experiments 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, and 13 relative to iteration 3. Nevertheless, it was rejected by the loss gate (0.1215 versus the accepted 0.1168), so it cannot be shipped. Important failures remain: terminal following is too high in Experiment 3 (0.746 versus 0.575), the arrangement contrast is too large in Experiment 5 (0.146 versus 0.003), and tally/majority effects remain excessive in Experiments 1 and 12. Terminal control is still too weak in Experiments 11 and 13. Moreover, the new ambiguity-sensitive temperature did not solve the targeted heterogeneity problem: Experiment 4 variance remains 0.023 versus 0.062, while variance is compressed in several other conditions. The revision also moved Experiment 6 away from the accepted candidate's near-exact fit and degraded the near-zero effects in Experiments 14 and 16. Thus the combined geometry, coalition-slope, and temperature intervention traded improvements in selected means for broader losses.
Rationale: Build on the unchanged accepted iteration-3 base, not on this rejected candidate. The previous recommendation to further sharpen the load window, reduce the coalition-balance slope, and add an ambiguity-sensitive arbitration temperature was rejected as a package, so do not repeat it. Instead, target a different in-family deficiency: terminal readout confidence currently depends only on run saturation and remains nearly deterministic even when the terminal object was retrieved from a fragmented display. Add a bounded retrieval-fidelity term to terminal_confidence, based on terminal-run integrity relative to the competing runs, while leaving terminal object access and the accepted load gate largely unchanged. Terminal confidence should remain high for coherent two-run or singleton-terminal displays, preserving Experiments 4 and 11–13, but move modestly toward 0.5 for fragmented multi-run displays. This should reduce excessive terminal agreement in Experiment 3 and the mixed-condition excess in Experiment 5 without recreating the Experiment 6 regression or globally weakening recency. Separately, replace the coalition's linear signed-support balance with separately saturated support for the two directional camps—for example, saturate positive and negative reliability mass before taking their bounded difference. This is preferable to another global reduction in coalition weight: it can reduce raw tally sensitivity in Experiment 1 and majority dominance in Experiment 12 while retaining a genuine coalition object. Keep the accepted iteration-3 early-commitment and vigilance settings rather than repeating the rejected intermediate-range and vigilance changes. Remove the ineffective ambiguity-temperature addition for now; once the mean structure improves, heterogeneity can be revisited with a more localized subject parameter such as variation in fragmented-terminal retrieval fidelity rather than broad contest sharpening.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.1215 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.2062 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed stimulus-local, history-free decision-object family, but it is decisively worse than the accepted iteration-3 base: aggregate loss rose from 0.1168 to 0.2062, so the gate correctly rejected it. The newly introduced run-fragmentation fidelity rule fixes Experiment 3 (0.595 versus 0.575), but it does not generalize. It creates a false switch-density effect in Experiment 7 (1.0 versus 0.0), collapses terminal control in Experiment 4 (0.312 versus 0.665), reverses and exaggerates the arrangement contrast in Experiment 5 (-0.135 versus 0.003), and worsens Experiment 8 (0.313 versus 0.172) and Experiment 9 (-0.186 versus -0.033). Thus, counting three or more directional runs is not a valid general marker of unreliable terminal retrieval: some short fragmented displays still show strong human terminal control. The separately saturated coalition calculation also failed to solve its targets. Experiment 1 remains far too tally-sensitive (0.732 versus 0.494), while Experiment 12 improves only modestly (0.256 versus 0.171), with collateral shifts elsewhere. The candidate retains good fits for the physical-gap invariance in Experiment 14, modest unanimous-load decline in Experiment 15, and weak history covariance in Experiment 16, but those successes were already present in the accepted base. Between-subject variance also remains poorly captured, especially the severe underprediction in Experiment 4.
Rationale: Build on the unchanged accepted iteration-3 model. My previous recommendation to use generic multi-run retrieval attenuation and separately saturated coalition camps was rejected by the gate, so do not repeat either modification. In particular, remove `n_runs >= 3` as a direct determinant of terminal confidence: it incorrectly treats the alternating four-cue displays in Experiment 4 as unreliable and directly violates the required limited switch-density effect in Experiment 7. Try a narrower in-family calibration aimed at the actual residual pattern in the accepted base: add only a mild conflict-load-dependent reduction in terminal readout fidelity for long conflicts (approximately seven or more discriminating reasons), applied similarly across sequence geometries at a given load and never on unanimous trials. This can reduce the high-load contribution to excessive terminal following in Experiment 3, slightly improve the overload balance in Experiment 6, and avoid manufacturing a low-switch/high-switch contrast in Experiment 7. Keep fidelity essentially unchanged for four-cue conflicts and manageable five-to-six-cue conflicts, protecting Experiments 4, 10, 11, and 13. Any reduction at ten reasons should be weak and geometry-neutral so that Experiment 5's mixed and block conditions move together rather than producing another arrangement contrast. Retain the accepted iteration-3 coalition computation, early commitment, vigilance settings, and load-sensitive terminal-access gate for this next test; the current broad coalition rewrite produced no aggregate benefit. Make this a small, isolated change rather than another multi-parameter package, since both of the last two packages were rejected.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.2062 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.1315 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed stimulus-local, history-free three-object arbitration family and preserves the key qualitative invariances: no practical switch-density effect in Experiment 7, little physical-gap effect in Experiment 14, weak history covariance in Experiment 16, and modest unanimous-load decline in Experiment 15. It also makes Experiment 6 essentially exact. However, the candidate was rejected by the accept gate (loss 0.1315 versus the accepted iteration-3 loss 0.1168), so it is not adequate. The geometry-neutral long-conflict fidelity reduction modestly lowers excessive terminal following in Experiment 3, from 0.768 in the accepted base to 0.743, but remains far above 0.575. It also worsens the already spurious Experiment 5 arrangement contrast to 0.210 versus 0.003. More importantly, the broader simulation moves away from the data in the manageable coherent reversals that the theory should explain: Experiment 11 falls to 0.675 versus 0.843, Experiment 12 predicts too much majority following (0.328 versus 0.171), and Experiment 13 falls to 0.773 versus 0.881. Experiment 1 remains too tally-sensitive (0.689 versus 0.494), and terminal control remains slightly weak in Experiment 4. Thus terminal control is not simply too strong at high load; it is too strong for fragmented terminal-singleton conflicts in Experiment 3 but too weak when a low-reliability terminal reason forms a coherent reversal against an otherwise unified prefix in Experiments 11–13. The current relative-reliability gate does not represent that distinction adequately. Between-subject variance also remains too compressed in Experiment 4, although mean calibration should be addressed first.
Rationale: Build on the unchanged accepted iteration-3 base. My previous recommendation for a geometry-neutral long-load readout reduction was rejected, so do not repeat or strengthen that intervention. Instead, modify the existing terminal-access reliability gate in one narrowly targeted, stimulus-local way: condition the minimum accessibility of a weak terminal reason on coherence of the preceding coalition. For manageable five-to-six-reason displays in which the prefix is directionally coherent and the terminal singleton or short terminal run creates the only reversal, impose a bounded floor on terminal access despite low terminal-relative reliability. This should raise terminal following in Experiments 11 and 13 and reduce majority following in Experiment 12 without globally increasing terminal susceptibility. Conversely, do not grant that floor when a terminal singleton follows an already fragmented prefix; for such displays with at least five discriminating reasons, retain the ordinary reliability gate or apply only a mild attenuation. That interaction targets the recurring high terminal agreement in Experiment 3 while leaving the alternating four-cue displays in Experiment 4 untouched and avoiding the generic switch-count rule that previously failed. Implement this as a small prefix-coherence-by-terminal-run adjustment to `reliability_gate`, not as another broad change to terminal confidence, coalition computation, or overall load fatigue. Keep the accepted early, coalition, vigilance, and history-free settings. Exclude seven-plus coherent reversals from any new penalty so Experiment 6 is not pushed away from its already good accepted-base fit. Once this mean structure improves, localized heterogeneity in the coherence-conditioned access floor can be considered for Experiment 4; broad susceptibility variation has already produced poor variance tradeoffs.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.1315 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "Reliability-Gated Decision-Object Arbitration with Prefix-Coherence-Conditioned Terminal Access. People construct at most three bounded objects from each display: an initial high-validity commitment, a reliability-weighted summary of the visible coalition, and a privileged terminal reason or terminal directional run. Arbitration is stimulus-local and history-free. Terminal evidence has a genuine recency advantage, but weak terminal evidence receives reliable access only when it constitutes the sole coherent reversal against a unified prefix at manageable load. A terminal reason following an already fragmented prefix receives no such accessibility floor and may be mildly discounted. Very short conflicts provide too little separation for a strongly privileged counterargument, whereas seven-or-more-reason conflicts reduce access through object competition rather than general count fatigue. The initial commitment remains a weak but non-negligible fallback, coalition evidence saturates, and unanimous evidence experiences only a modest vigilance decline. Stable variation in coherent-terminal accessibility, terminal susceptibility, coalition reliance, attention, and lapses produces heterogeneous conflict choices without learned context.",

This targets the weak low-validity reversal in Experiments 11 and 13 and should reduce erroneous majority following in Experiment 12 without globally increasing terminal susceptibility. A short terminal run following an already fragmented prefix receives a mild 12% accessibility discount, targeting excessive terminal agreement in Experiment 3 and the mixed-condition excess in Experiment 5. The discount does not apply to four-cue conflicts, protecting Experiment 4, and coherent seven-plus reversals receive neither the new floor nor the new penalty, protecting the accepted overload fit in Experiment 6. The new floor varies stably across subjects, expressing heterogeneity specifically where coherent terminal and coalition objects compete rather than broadening susceptibility in every condition."
