# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace pi_4 with a new directional-chunk or run-segmentation theory. The new theory should propose that sequentially viewed cues are compressed into contiguous directional runs. A coherent terminal run forms a strong decision chunk and can suppress earlier chunks, whereas an isolated final cue has weaker control, especially after many direction switches. Short sequences should retain high temporal resolution, producing the strong terminal association observed in Experiment 6; long alternating sequences should produce switch interference and moderate final-cue agreement, accounting for Experiment 5. Crucially, increasing conflict length must not trigger a validity-biased reversal toward early cues: coherent terminal runs should continue to dominate in Experiments 1 and 2, while prefix permutations should have little effect when they share the same strong suffix. Instructed validity may scale cue encoding or chunk confidence, but it should not become the dominant retrieval asymptote under overload. This theory differs from pi_3 by making directional chunks, run length, and number of switches—not independent cue-by-cue overwrites followed by count-based fatigue—the core representational mechanism. It differs from pi_4 by rejecting retrospective sampling and its forced long-conflict validity crossover. Its model should therefore include run formation, switch-dependent interference, recency-weighted competition among run summaries, confidence saturation within repeated-direction runs, and a small lapse process. It should be tested against separate conditions crossing total cue count, terminal-run length, and number of directional switches so that it remains distinguishable from pi_3 rather than becoming a flexible reparameterization of it.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Saturated Directional-Run Chunking with Boundary Interference. People scan discriminating cues in their instructed order and compress consecutive cues favoring the same option into a single directional chunk. Chunk confidence rises rapidly with run length but saturates, so two agreeing terminal cues can be nearly as effective as a much longer terminal run. At each directional boundary, the newly completed chunk suppresses the accumulated representation of earlier chunks. A coherent terminal run receives an additional replacement advantage, causing stimuli with the same strong suffix to converge despite differences in prefix segmentation. Short four-reason sequences preserve run structure at high temporal resolution and express terminal chunks with a heterogeneous gain, producing strong but individually variable terminal control. In longer sequences, switch-dense patterns suffer source interference, while long low-switch conflicts undergo a separate modest loss of response precision without recovering early high-validity cues. Instructed validity only modestly scales chunk encoding and cannot become the retrieval asymptote. Choices arise from recency-weighted competition among run summaries plus a small response lapse.

`rationale`:
This is a two-range calibration of the accepted model; all equations and successful mechanisms are unchanged. The long-low-switch loss is strengthened and widened from [0.05, 0.20] to [0.08, 0.34]. This selectively reduces the overly extreme choices produced by coherent seven-plus-cue conflicts in Experiment 1 and increases subject heterogeneity, while remaining moderate enough to move Experiment 6 only slightly toward chance. Switch interference is increased from [1.5, 2.5] to [1.8, 2.8], adding uncertainty only after more than two directional boundaries and thereby targeting Experiment 3 without weakening the coherent-suffix mechanism responsible for the strong Experiment 5 fit. The four-reason gain, suffix replacement, generic length interference, and validity encoding are preserved to protect the accepted fits in Experiments 2, 4, and 5.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.0707 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.0681 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.0468 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0386 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.0386.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The directional-run family is implemented faithfully and already captures the main cross-experiment pattern: terminal dominance without a long-conflict validity reversal. Fits are close in Experiments 2 (0.214 vs. 0.194), 3 (0.600 vs. 0.575), 5 (0.026 vs. 0.003), and 6 (early choice 0.288 vs. 0.307). However, two systematic calibration errors remain. Experiment 4 substantially underpredicts short-sequence terminal association (0.541 vs. 0.665), with far too little between-subject variance (0.008 vs. 0.062). Conversely, Experiment 1 overpredicts the support-versus-oppose contrast (0.603 vs. 0.494), indicating overly sharp terminal control in longer conflicts. The slight excess final-cue agreement in Experiment 3 and slightly excessive terminal dominance in Experiment 6 point in the same direction: long-sequence choice precision is still too high.
Rationale: Keep the directional-run mechanism, but sharpen its length-dependent calibration. Increase the short-sequence terminal-expression boost for four-cue conflicts—preferably through a short-sequence gain or stronger boundary replacement—so Experiment 4 rises toward 0.665; this should also move Experiment 2's TTB rate downward toward the observed 0.194. At the same time, modestly increase length-dependent precision loss for seven-plus discriminating cues. That should reduce Experiment 1's inflated contrast, lower Experiment 3's final-cue agreement toward 0.575, and raise Experiment 6's early-choice rate slightly toward 0.307 without introducing an early-validity reversal. Preserve the switch/run architecture and avoid changing validity weighting. Finally, widen subject-level variation in the short-resolution parameter, since the model makes Experiment 4 much more homogeneous than the human data.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0707 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.0681 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed directional-run family and the accepted revision improved aggregate loss. In particular, Experiment 2 is now essentially exact (0.191 versus 0.194), and Experiment 4 improved substantially from 0.541 to 0.600. Nevertheless, the fit is not yet experiment-invariant. Experiment 1 remains substantially too extreme: the support-versus-oppose contrast is 0.601 versus 0.494, and its between-subject variance is too low (0.009 versus 0.020). Experiment 4 still underpredicts terminal association (0.600 versus 0.665) and, more importantly, misses its large heterogeneity (variance 0.013 versus 0.062). The increased global length-interference range did not solve Experiment 1, worsened Experiment 3's excessive final-cue agreement (0.608 versus 0.575), enlarged the Experiment 5 prefix-permutation effect (0.063 versus 0.003), and moved Experiment 6 past its target (early choice 0.329 versus 0.307). Thus, further increasing generic length attenuation is unlikely to help.
Rationale: Keep the run-chunk architecture, but replace the overly broad length-based adjustment with more selective in-family calibration. The successful short-sequence adjustment should be retained and refined: add a heterogeneous short-sequence expression gain or terminal-boundary gain, rather than relying only on a bounded suppression increment. This should raise Experiment 4's mean and allow much greater subject variance without indiscriminately changing long sequences. Avoid another increase in global length interference; use an intermediate range near the old and current settings (for example, roughly 0.06–0.12), because the last increase created tradeoffs in Experiments 3, 5, and 6. Instead, make terminal suppression explicitly depend on suffix coherence: a terminal run of at least two agreeing cues should replace earlier run summaries more completely and saturate toward a common terminal representation regardless of prefix segmentation. That directly targets Experiment 5's excessive mixed-minus-block difference and should restore some terminal dominance in Experiment 6. Separately strengthen precision loss only for genuinely switch-dense alternating sequences, which can lower Experiment 3 without attenuating one- and two-switch suffix conflicts. Experiment 1 still requires reduced response extremity or greater heterogeneity specifically in long low-switch conflicts; tune a long-conflict gain/lapse parameter rather than increasing validity weighting or allowing early-cue recovery. These are calibration changes within the prescribed directional-run mechanism, not a change of theory family.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.0681 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.0468 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed directional-run mechanism, and the latest accepted revision is a substantial improvement. Experiments 2, 5, and 6 are essentially matched: TTB agreement is 0.195 versus 0.194, the prefix-permutation effect is 0.002 versus 0.003, and early-run choice under overload is 0.297 versus 0.307. The selective four-cue gain also successfully improved Experiment 4 to 0.650 versus 0.665 while raising its variance from 0.013 to 0.041, much closer to the observed 0.062. However, Experiment 1 remains a major exception and worsened from a +0.106 to a +0.139 error. The model produces too sharp a separation between tally-supporting and tally-opposing trials (0.633 versus 0.494), with too little heterogeneity (variance 0.009 versus 0.020). Thus, coherent long runs still yield overly extreme choices. Experiment 3 also retains moderately excessive final-cue agreement (0.606 versus 0.575), indicating that switch interference remains slightly too weak. These residual errors are calibration problems rather than evidence against the run-chunk family.
Rationale: Build on the accepted candidate and preserve the successful four-reason gain, suffix-coherence rule, modest validity scaling, and intermediate generic length interference. The prior selective advice was accepted and fixed Experiments 4 and 5, so those components should not be broadly retuned. Focus next on the two remaining errors. First, the newly introduced long-low-switch attenuation did not overcome the extra extremity associated with coherent runs in Experiment 1. Strengthen and broaden that specific attenuation modestly, or apply a saturating cap to effective choice gain for seven-plus-cue, low-switch conflicts. A wider subject-level range should both reduce the mean contrast and increase its currently deficient variance. Keep this adjustment moderate because Experiment 6 needs only a small movement toward chance—from 0.297 to 0.307 in early-option choice—and do not weaken suffix replacement globally, which produced the excellent Experiment 5 fit. Second, slightly increase switch-dependent precision loss only when there are more than two boundaries, aiming to lower Experiment 3 by about 0.03 without affecting low-switch Experiments 5 and 6. Avoid further changes to generic length interference or validity weighting. The goal is less response extremity in long low-switch sequences and slightly more uncertainty in switch-dense sequences, while retaining terminal directional dominance rather than allowing an early-validity reversal.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.0468 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0386 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

{
  "interpretation": "The candidate faithfully implements the prescribed directional-run mechanism and now captures the central pattern across all six experiments. Experiments 2 and 6 are essentially exact (0.198 versus 0.194; 0.307 versus 0.307), Experiment 4 reproduces the strong short-sequence terminal association (0.655 versus 0.665), and Experiment 5 retains the required near-invariance to prefix permutation (0.030 versus 0.003). Experiment 3 is slightly too terminal-cue consistent (0.604 versus 0.575), but the discrepancy is modest. The main remaining miss is Experiment 1: the support-versus-oppose contrast remains too large (0.586 versus 0.494), and its variance is too low (0.006 versus 0.020), indicating that long low-switch conflicts are still somewhat too deterministic and homogeneous. Experiment 4 also underestimates human heterogeneity (variance 0.032 versus 0.062). Nevertheless, the latest selective attenuation improved Experiment 1 substantially without disrupting the previously successful conditions, and the aggregate loss has fallen consistently from 0.0707 to 0.0386.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The theory is sufficiently experiment-invariant to retain. It explains strong terminal control in short sequences, moderate terminal agreement under switch interference, suffix-based convergence across prefix permutations, and the absence of a validity-driven reversal under overload. The remaining Experiment 1 extremity and underdispersion are quantitative calibration imperfections rather than a qualitative failure, and further broad tuning risks degrading the nearly exact fits in Experiments 2, 4, 5, and 6. The accepted progression also shows that the current parameterization is a stable improvement within the prescribed mechanism family."
