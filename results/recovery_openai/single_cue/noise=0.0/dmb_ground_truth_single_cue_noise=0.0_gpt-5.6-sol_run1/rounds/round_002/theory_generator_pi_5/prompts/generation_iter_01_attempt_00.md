# generation_iter_01_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace pi_4 with a new directional-chunk or run-segmentation theory. The new theory should propose that sequentially viewed cues are compressed into contiguous directional runs. A coherent terminal run forms a strong decision chunk and can suppress earlier chunks, whereas an isolated final cue has weaker control, especially after many direction switches. Short sequences should retain high temporal resolution, producing the strong terminal association observed in Experiment 6; long alternating sequences should produce switch interference and moderate final-cue agreement, accounting for Experiment 5. Crucially, increasing conflict length must not trigger a validity-biased reversal toward early cues: coherent terminal runs should continue to dominate in Experiments 1 and 2, while prefix permutations should have little effect when they share the same strong suffix. Instructed validity may scale cue encoding or chunk confidence, but it should not become the dominant retrieval asymptote under overload. This theory differs from pi_3 by making directional chunks, run length, and number of switches—not independent cue-by-cue overwrites followed by count-based fatigue—the core representational mechanism. It differs from pi_4 by rejecting retrospective sampling and its forced long-conflict validity crossover. Its model should therefore include run formation, switch-dependent interference, recency-weighted competition among run summaries, confidence saturation within repeated-direction runs, and a small lapse process. It should be tested against separate conditions crossing total cue count, terminal-run length, and number of directional switches so that it remains distinguishable from pi_3 rather than becoming a flexible reparameterization of it.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_3` (overall score: 0.891)

**Description**
Recency-Gated Reason Overwrite with Processing Fatigue. People inspect cues sequentially in descending order of instructed validity and continue after finding a discriminating cue. An attended discriminating cue establishes a provisional choice, and each subsequently attended discriminating cue can overwrite that choice. Consequently, the final attended reason has disproportionate control. Occasional failures to attend a cue preserve an earlier reason, while response lapses dilute strong recency effects. In addition, processing more than two discriminating reasons produces task-invariant update fatigue: the retained decision is expressed with progressively lower reliability as the discriminating-cue count increases. This preserves strong second-reason overwrite on short conflicts while moderating near-deterministic last-reason control on longer sequences.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.544)

**Description**
Interference-Limited Retrospective Reason Sampling with Length-Calibrated Accessibility. After viewing all cues, a decision maker retrospectively retrieves one or, subject to stable working-memory capacity, occasionally two discriminating reasons. In two-reason conflicts, retrieval has a strong saturated terminal-recency floor, producing reliable last-reason capture without importing subject heterogeneity from longer conflicts. Around four reasons, stable variation in recency remains expressed. When conflicts exceed four reasons, nonlinear source interference flattens recency while accessibility approaches a validity-biased rather than uniform asymptote. Choice follows the signed, validity-sensitive evidence supplied by the retrieved reasons, with a small response lapse.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.381)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Saturated Directional-Run Chunking with Boundary Interference. People scan discriminating cues in their instructed order and compress consecutive cues favoring the same option into a single directional chunk. Chunk confidence rises rapidly with run length but saturates, so two agreeing terminal cues can be nearly as effective as a much longer terminal run. At each directional boundary, the newly completed chunk suppresses the accumulated representation of earlier chunks; suppression is especially effective for coherent terminal runs. Short sequences preserve their run structure at high temporal resolution and therefore exhibit strong terminal control even when directions alternate. In longer sequences, more than two directional switches produce source-interference that reduces the precision with which the terminal chunk is expressed, without restoring privileged access to early, high-validity cues. Instructed validity only modestly scales encoding within each chunk and cannot cause a long-conflict validity reversal. Choices are generated from the recency-weighted competition among chunk summaries plus a small response lapse.

`rationale`: The model implements the arbiter's proposed representational unit directly: contiguous directional runs, rather than independently overwritten cues or retrospectively sampled reasons. Rapid confidence saturation makes terminal runs of length two and five similarly compelling, helping predict the near-zero block-versus-mixed contrast in Experiment 5. Boundary suppression allows the late opposing runs in Experiments 1, 2, and 6 to dominate without any long-sequence crossover toward early valid cues. The short-resolution boost produces strong terminal associations in two- to four-reason conflicts, supporting Experiments 2 and 4. In contrast, the quadratic penalty for switches beyond two selectively moderates final-cue agreement in the longer, highly alternating conditions of Experiment 3 while leaving the one- and two-switch permutations in Experiment 5 comparatively similar. Mild length interference moderates expression in seven- and eight-reason overload conditions but only lowers precision; it cannot reverse the represented direction. The proposal is distinguishable from cue-overwrite fatigue because run length affects saturated chunk confidence, while switch count—not raw cue count—causes the principal interference. It predicts separate effects of total length, terminal-run length, and directional-switch count when these factors are experimentally crossed.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The directional-run family is implemented faithfully and already captures the main cross-experiment pattern: terminal dominance without a long-conflict validity reversal. Fits are close in Experiments 2 (0.214 vs. 0.194), 3 (0.600 vs. 0.575), 5 (0.026 vs. 0.003), and 6 (early choice 0.288 vs. 0.307). However, two systematic calibration errors remain. Experiment 4 substantially underpredicts short-sequence terminal association (0.541 vs. 0.665), with far too little between-subject variance (0.008 vs. 0.062). Conversely, Experiment 1 overpredicts the support-versus-oppose contrast (0.603 vs. 0.494), indicating overly sharp terminal control in longer conflicts. The slight excess final-cue agreement in Experiment 3 and slightly excessive terminal dominance in Experiment 6 point in the same direction: long-sequence choice precision is still too high.
Rationale: Keep the directional-run mechanism, but sharpen its length-dependent calibration. Increase the short-sequence terminal-expression boost for four-cue conflicts—preferably through a short-sequence gain or stronger boundary replacement—so Experiment 4 rises toward 0.665; this should also move Experiment 2's TTB rate downward toward the observed 0.194. At the same time, modestly increase length-dependent precision loss for seven-plus discriminating cues. That should reduce Experiment 1's inflated contrast, lower Experiment 3's final-cue agreement toward 0.575, and raise Experiment 6's early-choice rate slightly toward 0.307 without introducing an early-validity reversal. Preserve the switch/run architecture and avoid changing validity weighting. Finally, widen subject-level variation in the short-resolution parameter, since the model makes Experiment 4 much more homogeneous than the human data.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.0707 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "Saturated Directional-Run Chunking with Boundary Interference. People scan discriminating cues in their instructed order and compress consecutive cues favoring the same option into a single directional chunk. Chunk confidence rises rapidly with run length but saturates, so two agreeing terminal cues can be nearly as effective as a much longer terminal run. At each directional boundary, the newly completed chunk suppresses the accumulated representation of earlier chunks; suppression is especially effective for coherent terminal runs. Short sequences preserve their run structure at high temporal resolution and therefore exhibit strong terminal control even when directions alternate. In longer sequences, more than two directional switches produce source-interference that reduces the precision with which the terminal chunk is expressed, without restoring privileged access to early, high-validity cues. Instructed validity only modestly scales encoding within each chunk and cannot cause a long-conflict validity reversal. Choices are generated from the recency-weighted competition among chunk summaries plus a small response lapse.",

The short-resolution range is widened and its mean increased, strengthening terminal-run replacement in four-cue conflicts and introducing substantially more subject-level heterogeneity. This should raise Experiment 4's terminal association and variance while reducing Experiment 2's excessive agreement with the first discriminating cue. The length-interference range is increased from [0.04, 0.10] to [0.08, 0.16], selectively reducing choice precision as discriminating-cue count grows beyond four. It should lower the excessive long-sequence terminal effects in Experiments 1 and 3 and move Experiment 6's early-choice rate upward toward the observed value. Because length interference only attenuates gain, it cannot produce the rejected validity-biased reversal toward early cues. The broader short-resolution range, rather than added validity weighting or a new mechanism, directly addresses the missing between-subject variance in Experiment 4."
