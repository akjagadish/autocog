# feedback_iter_03

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace pi_2 with a retrospective, capacity-limited reason-sampling theory. After inspecting the cues, people should retrieve a small subset of discriminating reasons from working memory; retrieval is strongly biased toward recent cues but also modulated by instructed validity. Choice is based on the signed, validity-sensitive evidence among retrieved reasons rather than an equal tally or a literal sequence of overwrites. Interference should increase nonlinearly with the number of discriminating cues, reducing terminal capture in longer conflicts while permitting very strong terminal control around four cues. Include stable subject-level variation in retrieval capacity and recency bias to accommodate the high variance in Experiment 2, plus a small response lapse. This theory differs from pi_2 by predicting order and validity effects, and from pi_3 by locating recency in retrospective accessibility and interference rather than online overwriting with geometric post hoc fatigue. It should reproduce above-chance final-cue capture in Experiments 1–2, the Experiment 3 contrast, and the very low first-cue agreement in Experiment 4, while predicting condition-level effects of terminal runs, sequence length, and validity gaps.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Interference-Limited Retrospective Reason Sampling with Length-Calibrated Accessibility. After viewing all cues, a decision maker retrospectively retrieves one or, subject to stable working-memory capacity, occasionally two discriminating reasons. In two-reason conflicts, retrieval has a strong saturated terminal-recency floor, producing reliable last-reason capture without importing subject heterogeneity from longer conflicts. Around four reasons, stable variation in recency remains expressed. When conflicts exceed four reasons, nonlinear source interference flattens recency while accessibility approaches a validity-biased rather than uniform asymptote. Choice follows the signed, validity-sensitive evidence supplied by the retrieved reasons, with a small response lapse.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal accessibility edit to the accepted model. First, two-cue conflicts receive a strong but saturated recency gradient. This should lower Experiment 2 first-cue agreement and its between-subject variance without narrowing the broad recency distribution responsible for Experiment 4's accurately reproduced heterogeneity. Second, overload now selectively increases validity-based accessibility while cubic interference continues to suppress temporal recency. Long conflicts therefore approach validity-biased retrieval rather than uniform, tally-like sampling, which should reduce Experiment 1's excessive TTB–tally contrast. The capacity limit, four-cue recency regime, evidence mapping, continuation mechanism, lapse, and all parameter ranges are otherwise unchanged.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2465 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1726 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1147 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.0353 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 4 at loss=0.0353.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate captures two experiments well but misses the central short-conflict recency pattern. Experiment 1 is excellent (0.504 versus 0.494), and Experiment 3 is close, with only modest excess final-cue agreement (0.605 versus 0.575). In contrast, Experiment 2 predicts near-chance agreement with the first discriminating cue (0.507) when humans strongly reject it (0.194), and Experiment 4 produces a much too weak terminal-cue association (0.245 versus 0.665). Experiment 4 also severely underpredicts between-subject variance (0.014 versus 0.062). Thus, the model has the right qualitative retrospective architecture and long-conflict interference, but retrieved low-validity reasons do not exert sufficiently decisive control over choice.
Rationale: Keep the prescribed retrospective, capacity-limited reason-sampling family, but recalibrate the mapping from retrieved reasons to choice. The current signed log-odds evidence makes a retrieved low-validity terminal cue intrinsically weak; even when accessibility successfully retrieves it, the logistic choice remains close to chance. This likely explains both the near-chance Experiment 2 result and the attenuated Experiment 4 association. Add a baseline directional strength to each retrieved reason, with validity modulating that strength—for example, use sign × (evidence_floor + scaled log-odds), or normalize reliability before applying the choice temperature. Alternatively, substantially increase the evidence gain for low-validity retrieved cues while retaining validity sensitivity. Also widen stable subject variation in recency/accessibility or continuation around four-cue conflicts to raise Experiment 4 variance. Because stronger retrieved-cue commitment may raise the already slightly excessive terminal agreement in Experiment 3, compensate specifically through somewhat stronger overload interference for m>4 rather than weakening short-conflict recency. Preserve the current successful Experiment 1 fit and the nonlinear long-conflict interference; the main required change is making retrieved terminal reasons decisive in two- and four-cue conflicts.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2465 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1726 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision substantially improves the short-conflict recency pattern: Experiment 2 moves from 0.507 to 0.289 against 0.194 observed, and Experiment 4 moves from 0.245 to 0.565 against 0.665. Experiment 3 remains reasonably close, although terminal-cue agreement is slightly excessive (0.618 versus 0.575). However, this improvement produces a major regression in Experiment 1: the tally-support contrast rises from an excellent 0.504 to 0.778, far above the observed 0.494. The model now makes retrieved reasons sufficiently decisive, but long conflicts remain too recency-dominated. Experiment 4 also continues to understate stable individual differences, with variance 0.029 versus 0.062 observed.
Rationale: Retain the retrospective, capacity-limited reason-sampling mechanism and the new baseline evidence strength; the previous advice was accepted and clearly improved Experiments 2 and 4. Do not globally reduce the evidence floor or gain, because that would likely undo those gains. Instead, strengthen the existing nonlinear overload interference specifically for more than four discriminating cues. The current interference range of 0.15–0.35 leaves substantial recency even at six or seven cues, causing excessive separation between Experiment 1's short, mutually supporting cases and its long cue-conflict cases. A materially higher interference range, or a steeper overload normalization, should flatten accessibility in those long conflicts, increase first-cue agreement there, and bring the Experiment 1 contrast downward. The same selective adjustment should also reduce Experiment 3's modest excess terminal agreement while leaving the crucial two- and four-cue recency effects in Experiments 2 and 4 intact. Separately, widen stable subject-level heterogeneity in recency bias or continuation probability around four-cue conflicts, while preserving its mean, to approach Experiment 4's high variance without changing the mechanism family or weakening average terminal control.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1726 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1147 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current accepted revision is a meaningful improvement and is faithful to the prescribed retrospective reason-sampling family. Experiment 3 is now very close (0.565 versus 0.575), and Experiment 4 is excellent in both its mean terminal association (0.640 versus 0.665) and between-subject variance (0.063 versus 0.062). However, two canonical effects remain materially wrong. Experiment 1 still has an excessive TTB–tally contrast (0.654 versus 0.494), while Experiment 2 still predicts too much first-cue agreement (0.327 versus 0.194) and too much subject variance (0.019 versus 0.0049). Thus the cubic-interference adjustment helped, as the accepted loss reduction confirms, but it has exposed a calibration problem: overloaded retrieval becomes too nearly uniform across reasons and therefore follows the cue tally, whereas short two-cue conflicts are not uniformly recency-dominated enough.
Rationale: Keep the current mechanism, evidence floor, and strong four-cue recency regime; these now explain Experiment 4 extremely well, and the previous pushes in this family were both accepted. Do not merely make interference globally steeper again. Instead, change what accessibility approaches under overload: flatten the recency component while retaining or modestly strengthening validity-biased accessibility, rather than allowing retrieval to approach uniform sampling. In Experiment 1's six- and seven-cue TTB–tally conflicts, uniform reason sampling favors the tally majority and sustains the excessive contrast; a validity-weighted overload asymptote should increase choices following the highest-validity cue and reduce that contrast. Use only a modest overload-dependent validity boost because Experiment 3 is already slightly below its target. Separately, strengthen and saturate recency specifically in two-cue conflicts—e.g., a small short-conflict recency floor or an m-normalized accessibility function—so nearly all subjects reject the first cue in Experiment 2. This should lower both its mean first-cue agreement and its excessive variance without narrowing the broad subject-level recency distribution that is needed for Experiment 4's correctly reproduced heterogeneity. The target is therefore length-dependent calibration within retrospective retrieval: reliable terminal capture at m=2, heterogeneous strong capture at m=4, and validity-biased rather than tally-like retrieval under m>4 interference.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1147 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.0353 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate now captures the empirical pattern across all four experiments and remains faithful to the prescribed retrospective, capacity-limited reason-sampling family. Experiment 1\u2019s TTB\u2013tally contrast is close to observed (0.5300 versus 0.4944), showing that overloaded retrieval is no longer excessively tally-like. Experiment 2 reproduces the striking rejection of the first discriminating cue (0.2106 versus 0.1938) with similarly low between-subject variance. Experiment 3\u2019s final-cue agreement is also close (0.5554 versus 0.5750). Experiment 4 captures both strong terminal control (0.6342 versus 0.6650) and, importantly, its large individual-difference variance (0.0573 versus 0.0621). The remaining deviations are small and mixed in direction rather than indicating a common missing mechanism. Experiment 1 variance remains somewhat too low and Experiment 3 variance somewhat too high, but the canonical pooled effects are all well reproduced.",
  "verdict": "continue",
  "rationale": "The accepted length-calibrated accessibility changes produced a large loss reduction from 0.1147 to 0.0353 and resolved both major residual failures identified previously without sacrificing Experiments 3\u20134. The model now exhibits the required regime structure: saturated terminal retrieval in two-reason conflicts, heterogeneous strong recency around four reasons, and validity-sensitive accessibility after temporal information is degraded by overload. Further tuning to eliminate the small remaining discrepancies risks upsetting this successful cross-experiment balance. The theory is sufficiently experiment-invariant to retain."
