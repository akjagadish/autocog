# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_3`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_2`).

Replace pi_2 with a retrospective, capacity-limited reason-sampling theory. After inspecting the cues, people should retrieve a small subset of discriminating reasons from working memory; retrieval is strongly biased toward recent cues but also modulated by instructed validity. Choice is based on the signed, validity-sensitive evidence among retrieved reasons rather than an equal tally or a literal sequence of overwrites. Interference should increase nonlinearly with the number of discriminating cues, reducing terminal capture in longer conflicts while permitting very strong terminal control around four cues. Include stable subject-level variation in retrieval capacity and recency bias to accommodate the high variance in Experiment 2, plus a small response lapse. This theory differs from pi_2 by predicting order and validity effects, and from pi_3 by locating recency in retrospective accessibility and interference rather than online overwriting with geometric post hoc fatigue. It should reproduce above-chance final-cue capture in Experiments 1–2, the Experiment 3 contrast, and the very low first-cue agreement in Experiment 4, while predicting condition-level effects of terminal runs, sequence length, and validity gaps.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Interference-Limited Retrospective Reason Sampling. After viewing all cues, a decision maker does not integrate the complete cue vector or preserve a sequence of provisional choices. Instead, they retrospectively retrieve one or, subject to a stable working-memory capacity, occasionally two discriminating reasons. Retrieval accessibility increases sharply with recency and more modestly with instructed validity. When a conflict contains more than four discriminating cues, source interference grows quadratically, flattening the recency gradient and preventing the final cue from capturing every long decision. Retrieved reasons are combined using signed log-odds of their instructed validities, so a retrieved high-validity reason can defeat a conflicting lower-validity reason. Stable differences in capacity and recency bias generate individual variation, while a small response lapse adds residual noise.

- evidence_gain: [3.0, 7.0]
- lapse_rate: [0.03, 0.17]

`rationale`:
The model implements the arbiter's retrospective mechanism rather than tallying or online overwriting. A steep accessibility gradient gives the final discriminating cue strong control in short conflicts, explaining the low agreement with the first cue in Experiment 2 and the strong fourth-cue association in Experiment 4. Its quadratic overload term specifically distinguishes four-cue conflicts from the longer conflicts in Experiment 3: recency remains strong around four cues but is diluted as the number of competing memory traces rises. This should reduce the excessive long-sequence terminal capture produced by pi_3 without sacrificing its successful short-conflict recency. Occasional retrieval of a second reason creates terminal-run and validity-gap effects: concordant recent reasons reinforce one another, whereas conflicting retrieved reasons are resolved by instructed validity rather than an equal tally. Capacity, recency, and lapse are sampled once per subject, producing stable individual differences and greater between-subject variance in terminal-cue reliance. Because the mechanism depends on discriminating-cue count, ordinal recency, validity, and directional agreement rather than any experiment-specific stimulus template, it generalizes across feature counts and designs.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2465 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.2465.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate captures two experiments well but misses the central short-conflict recency pattern. Experiment 1 is excellent (0.504 versus 0.494), and Experiment 3 is close, with only modest excess final-cue agreement (0.605 versus 0.575). In contrast, Experiment 2 predicts near-chance agreement with the first discriminating cue (0.507) when humans strongly reject it (0.194), and Experiment 4 produces a much too weak terminal-cue association (0.245 versus 0.665). Experiment 4 also severely underpredicts between-subject variance (0.014 versus 0.062). Thus, the model has the right qualitative retrospective architecture and long-conflict interference, but retrieved low-validity reasons do not exert sufficiently decisive control over choice.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Keep the prescribed retrospective, capacity-limited reason-sampling family, but recalibrate the mapping from retrieved reasons to choice. The current signed log-odds evidence makes a retrieved low-validity terminal cue intrinsically weak; even when accessibility successfully retrieves it, the logistic choice remains close to chance. This likely explains both the near-chance Experiment 2 result and the attenuated Experiment 4 association. Add a baseline directional strength to each retrieved reason, with validity modulating that strength\u2014for example, use sign \u00d7 (evidence_floor + scaled log-odds), or normalize reliability before applying the choice temperature. Alternatively, substantially increase the evidence gain for low-validity retrieved cues while retaining validity sensitivity. Also widen stable subject variation in recency/accessibility or continuation around four-cue conflicts to raise Experiment 4 variance. Because stronger retrieved-cue commitment may raise the already slightly excessive terminal agreement in Experiment 3, compensate specifically through somewhat stronger overload interference for m>4 rather than weakening short-conflict recency. Preserve the current successful Experiment 1 fit and the nonlinear long-conflict interference; the main required change is making retrieved terminal reasons decisive in two- and four-cue conflicts."
