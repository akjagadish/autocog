# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=8):** [0.95, 0.51, 0.51, 0.51, 0.735, 0.735, 0.735, 0.735]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This eight-pair design holds the signed tally at exactly zero while varying coalition size and composition. In the four base pairs, A is endorsed by one 95%-valid expert plus respectively 0, 1, 2, or 3 near-chance (51%) experts; B is endorsed by respectively 1, 2, 3, or 4 experts of 73.5% validity. Because both sides have equal numbers of endorsers within every pair, the advocated model's common reliability floor cancels. Across its parameter range, its evidence for A is approximately 1.99–2.09, 1.01–1.10, 0.02–0.11, and -0.96–-0.88. It therefore predicts a steep decline in A choices and a robust directional crossover on the fourth condition, where four moderately reliable experts cumulatively outweigh the high expert and three weak experts. Compressed-Reliability Consensus instead assigns every condition a tied tally and compares bounded group summaries. Softmax attention keeps A's group summary dominated by the 95% expert: its reliability contrast remains positive at approximately 0.295, 0.273, 0.252, and 0.232. It consequently predicts A above chance in all four conditions, with only a shallow decline and no crossover. Thus the critical dissociation is a large accumulation-driven gradient ending below chance versus a near-flat, uniformly above-chance consensus pattern. The final four pairs are exact A/B reversals, balancing response side and requiring both patterns to mirror. Eight unique pairs are each repeated 12 times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Communicated-Reliability Accumulation theory proposes that people integrate every discriminating expert rating after translating communicated validity into subjective diagnostic weight. The weight is a mildly superlinear log-odds transformation plus a modest common reliability floor: w_j = logit(v_j)^gamma + c. The log-odds component privileges more reliable experts, while the positive floor represents a minimal contribution assigned to any expert judged better than chance. Net evidence favoring A is E = sum_j w_j(A_j-B_j). Consequently, sufficiently numerous weaker experts can overturn a stronger cue, and concordant cue-number margins generate graded confidence. Choice sensitivity varies moderately across people, while only very rare lapses produce validity-independent guessing. Choice history is ignored because the task provides no outcome feedback.

**Parameters:**
- beta: [0.24, 0.58]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.005]
- gamma: [1.02, 1.05]
- reliability_floor: [0.10, 0.14]
- validities: validities

```


## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Compressed-Reliability Consensus theory holds that people represent every discriminating expert primarily as one categorical vote and encode communicated reliability through a separate, bounded comparison of the two endorsing groups. For each option, attention is biased moderately toward its more reliable endorsers, but their reliabilities are summarized as a softmax-weighted mean rather than accumulated expert by expert. Net evidence is therefore the full signed tally plus an identity-sensitive contrast between the two bounded group summaries. Agreement additionally amplifies confidence as the absolute tally margin grows, with amplification saturating after a decisive coalition has formed. This representation permits expert identity to determine equal-tally choices, preserves substantial influence for near-chance experts, and allows sufficiently numerous weak experts to override the strongest expert. Reliability sensitivity, consensus amplification, choice sensitivity, and lapse rate vary across subjects. Because the task provides no correctness feedback, choices are reversal-symmetric and independent of history.

**Parameters:**
- reliability_sensitivity: [0.65, 1.05]
- consensus_amplification: [0.03, 0.07]

- validities: validities

**`predict source code`:**

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

It scores choices for the option endorsed by the 95%-valid expert. Accumulation predicts strong preference for that option at coalition sizes 1 and 2 but preference against it at size 4; the consensus theory predicts only a weak, uniformly positive preference. Thus the positive weights on p1 and p2 and negative weight on p4 align the three largest predicted probability differences. The size-3 condition is omitted because its expected difference is near zero and would mainly add binomial noise. Each included condition has 24 observations per subject after combining reversals, yielding a comparatively stable within-subject contrast."
