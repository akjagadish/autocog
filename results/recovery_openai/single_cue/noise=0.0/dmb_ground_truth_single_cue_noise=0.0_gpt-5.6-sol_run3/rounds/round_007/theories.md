**Description:** Contextual Anti-Reliability Arbitration theory proposes that communicated validity numbers are interpreted partly as pragmatic claims whose assertiveness can undermine their credibility. Every above-chance claim therefore generates continuous evidence against the option endorsed by that expert, rather than being categorically reversed by a special subgroup. The magnitude of this anti-reliability response varies continuously across people. Near-perfect claims additionally evoke endpoint distrust because unusually strong assurances are perceived as especially suspicious. When an endpoint cue faces a substantive opposing claim, both its ordinary and endpoint-specific distrust contributions are attenuated; against a genuinely neutral cue, both remain intact. Claims around 95% are more strongly compressed in the ordinary channel and do not receive the endpoint bonus, separating near-endpoint skepticism from distrust of literal certainty. Anti-reliability evidence is accumulated separately from the raw vote tally and divisively normalized by coalition breadth, within-side compositional heterogeneity, and sparse across-side claim mismatch. The latter detects heterogeneous singleton conflicts that within-side dispersion cannot detect, while exempting an isolated certainty claim opposed by a neutral cue. A small smooth boost preserves moderate-claim distrust in broad but not maximally dense coalitions. Its influence is strongest when the validity contrast is concentrated and the tally is tied or weak, while it decays smoothly as the absolute tally margin grows. Raw tally evidence additionally receives a continuously heterogeneous, intermediate-margin decision-temperature adjustment. The mechanism remains continuous, option-swap symmetric, and history independent because choices are followed by no accuracy feedback.

**Rationale:** This is a minimal edit to the accepted iteration-7 candidate. The ordinary validity mapping, endpoint range, intermediate-margin temperature, tally mapping, and response transformation are all retained. The main addition is an across-active compositional normalizer. Unlike within-side variance, it remains informative when each side has only one endorser, so it can dilute sparse mismatched claim contrasts in Experiment 8 and related heterogeneous profiles. Its effect decreases quadratically with coalition size, and a continuous endpoint-neutral exemption preserves the successful isolated 100%-versus-50% reversal in Experiment 10. The concentration-floor range is shifted modestly upward to strengthen anti-reliability in diffuse but coherent moderate coalitions such as Experiments 7 and 11. The within-side composition-dilution range is widened upward to offset that increase in heterogeneous broad profiles such as Experiments 1 and 9. These changes express heterogeneity through contextual composition parameters rather than global choice sensitivity, while preserving option-swap symmetry, smooth arbitration, and history independence.

### slot 2 — `pi_9` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Finite-Pool Pragmatic Claim Competition theory proposes that binary expert endorsements generate two separable signals. A categorical vote channel counts every discriminating expert equally and therefore represents coalition consensus independently of communicated validity. A pragmatic claim channel interprets an expert's stated validity as the assertiveness of the expert's claim. Claim assertiveness is encoded by a smooth linear function of the communicated scale, including from 90% through 100%. Most people respond skeptically to assertive claims, although the polarity and magnitude of this interpretation vary continuously across individuals and can include weakly conventional interpretations. Claim processing draws on a finite attentional pool. Every discriminating expert, including a nominally 50%-valid expert whose own claim carries no directional strength, competes for that pool. Competition increases both with active-set size and with similarity among simultaneously active claims. Consequently, an isolated high-validity claim can receive substantial attention, whereas its influence declines when embedded in a broad or compositionally redundant coalition. This single allocation rule produces breadth and composition effects without endpoint bonuses, validity notches, or condition-specific exemptions. Pragmatic claim evidence is bounded, while categorical tally evidence continues to increase with vote margin. Skepticism can thus reverse tied or weak tallies but normally yields to a decisive raw-vote coalition. In the absence of outcome feedback, neither signal is recalibrated from choice history.

**Rationale:** This is a parameter-only recalibration of the accepted finite-pool model; its equations and mechanism are unchanged. Tally sensitivity is reduced from [0.85, 1.25] to [0.55, 0.95], and the upper choice-sensitivity bound is modestly lowered. These edits reduce excessive tally determinism in Experiments 1, 3, 4, and 6 while allowing skeptical evidence to overcome one-vote margins more often in Experiments 7 and 11. Claim accumulation is increased, making isolated and tied claim contrasts more potent in Experiments 8, 10, and 12. At the same time, lower and substantially narrower attentional capacity, together with slightly stronger baseline competition, controls accumulation in broad active sets and should enlarge Experiment 14's breadth attenuation rather than applying a blanket claim-strength increase that would exacerbate Experiment 5. The claim-construal range is narrowed considerably while retaining a small continuous conventional tail, reducing the excessive interaction-driven heterogeneity seen in several coalition experiments without reintroducing categorical construal classes. Similarity width is only tightened slightly, preserving the single general competition principle and the linear 90/95/100 validity representation.

## Replacement

### `pi_10` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Coalition-Level Skeptical Consensus theory proposes that people do not compare communicated validities expert by expert. They first construct a representation of each option's endorsing coalition from three attributes: its mean assertiveness, its breadth, and its internal coherence. Mean assertiveness increases smoothly with communicated validity from 50% through 100%, without endpoint bonuses, notches, or categorical boundaries. Repeated similarly assertive endorsements strengthen the coalition representation according to a sublinear consensus function, whereas heterogeneous coalitions are represented less coherently. The contrast between the two coalition representations is additionally normalized by total conflict breadth and compositional mixture. In narrow conflicts, reactance is further normalized when both coalitions make substantive claims or when neither coalition approaches the maximum of the same smooth assertiveness continuum. This leaves a maximal 100%-versus-50% contrast intact while attenuating moderate and bilateral narrow conflicts without creating an endpoint bonus or threshold. People pragmatically react against the coalition making the stronger aggregate claim, so the coalition contrast enters choice with a skeptical sign. This reactance is continuous across individuals and can be weak rather than defining discrete skeptic classes. A smooth breadth-dependent gain makes isolated conflicts less reactance-provoking than repeated consensus, while preserving compression in very broad conflicts. A separate categorical tally channel ignores validity and increases nonlinearly with the absolute vote margin. It is weak enough at ties and one-vote margins to permit anti-validity reversals, but gradually protects decisive majorities without forcing ceiling-level tally choices. A shared continuous reactance trait modulates margin curvature. This modulation is centered and analytically mean-corrected, so it preserves the population-average tally function while producing increasingly large individual differences at large margins. Independent continuous variation in tally sensitivity and decision noise supplies further subject heterogeneity. Because choices receive no correctness feedback, coalition construction is history independent; because all evidence is expressed as signed option contrasts, the model is exactly invariant to swapping A and B.

**Rationale:** This is an isolated edit to the accepted iteration-4 tally heterogeneity mechanism. All coalition summaries, contextual normalizers, skeptical accumulation, tally sensitivity, and decision equations are retained. The reactance–margin coupling range is widened, and the resulting exponent variation is divided by its analytic mean under the continuous reactance trait. Consequently, the average raw-tally evidence remains approximately equal to the accepted model at each margin, protecting Experiment 2's successful mean margin profile, while individual differences grow with log margin. One-vote evidence is unchanged exactly. At margins five and above, the added spread should reduce pooled ceiling probabilities through logistic curvature and increase between-subject variance in Experiments 4 and 6. The edit avoids the rejected explicit saturation, common-mode cancellation, concave coalition readout, and additional bilateral normalizers, thereby minimizing risk to Experiments 7, 10, 12, 14, and 16.
