# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace pi_4 with a task-invariant Latent Validity-Construal Tally theory. Its central claim should be that participants first form a categorical vote tally, but differ in how they construe the communicated validity scale. The dominant construal in these data should map larger stated validity to less decision weight—or equivalently treat low stated values as the more diagnostic/safer signal—rather than assuming universally positive credibility weighting. A smaller subgroup may ignore validity or use it conventionally, accounting for between-subject variance. At the computational level, use a signed monotonic validity-orientation parameter or discrete subject-level construal class, a raw-tally term, and bounded/saturating reliability evidence accumulated over discriminating experts. The negative orientation must be able to overturn a one-vote tally in Experiment 1 and determine exact-tally choices in Experiment 2, while the tally term must still dominate decisive many-versus-few coalitions in Experiments 4, 6, and 8. Preserve reversal symmetry and history independence. This differs fundamentally from both current theories: it changes the psychological meaning and possible direction of instructed validity, rather than only changing whether positively oriented reliability is accumulated cue by cue or summarized by endorsing group.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_4` (overall score: 0.917)

**Description**
Compressed-Reliability Consensus theory holds that people represent every discriminating expert primarily as one categorical vote and encode communicated reliability through a separate, bounded comparison of the two endorsing groups. For each option, attention is biased moderately toward its more reliable endorsers, but their reliabilities are summarized as a softmax-weighted mean rather than accumulated expert by expert. Net evidence is therefore the full signed tally plus an identity-sensitive contrast between the two bounded group summaries. Agreement additionally amplifies confidence as the absolute tally margin grows, with amplification saturating after a decisive coalition has formed. This representation permits expert identity to determine equal-tally choices, preserves substantial influence for near-chance experts, and allows sufficiently numerous weak experts to override the strongest expert. Reliability sensitivity, consensus amplification, choice sensitivity, and lapse rate vary across subjects. Because the task provides no correctness feedback, choices are reversal-symmetric and independent of history.

### `pi_5` (overall score: 0.801)

**Description**
Uncertain-Credibility Normalized Voting theory proposes that people do not treat instructed expert validities as precisely known reliabilities. In the absence of feedback, each communicated validity is shrunk toward a shared, moderately credible prototype. Consequently, every discriminating expert supplies one dominant categorical vote, while the incompletely trusted deviation of that expert's validity from the prototype supplies only a residual adjustment. Extreme communicated deviations are compressed smoothly because participants regard unusually high or low precision claims as especially uncertain, while still retaining limited distinctions among the most credible experts. These residual adjustments are accumulated cue by cue, preserving expert identity, but their total is divisively normalized and increasingly bounded once a clear tally coalition exists. Residual reliability is also contextually gated: it is strongly discounted in exact tally ties, where conflicting reliability claims provide no categorical direction, while otherwise retaining its ordinary residual weight without a special margin-one amplification. Before saturation, total evidence undergoes a moderately convex magnitude transformation, making small vote margins comparatively uncertain while preserving confidence for large coalitions. The resulting evidence is passed through a saturating response transformation, so additional agreement has diminishing effects once evidence is decisive. Between-person differences arise in reliability shrinkage, response sensitivity, and lapse rate. Because choices reveal no correctness information, the representation is not updated from choice history.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.339)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL
Propose a novel theory from scratch based on all the information available, faithfully implementing the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed above. Do NOT simply reuse anything generated in past rounds.

  "theory": "Latent Validity-Construal Tally theory proposes that participants first encode each discriminating expert as one categorical vote and form an unweighted vote margin. Communicated validities are represented separately as monotonic diagnostic-strength codes whose signed sum is compressed into bounded reliability evidence. Crucially, participants differ in their interpretation of the communicated validity scale. The dominant latent construal treats lower stated values as safer or more diagnostic, reversing the direction of reliability evidence. Small subgroups either disregard the validity information or interpret it conventionally. Because reliability evidence is bounded, the dominant reversed construal can overturn a one-vote tally or resolve an exact tally, but it cannot overturn a decisive many-versus-few coalition. When bounded reliability evidence overturns an otherwise weak tally, participants commit to the resulting categorical interpretation rather than treating it as a barely negative arithmetic sum. The model is reversal-symmetric and history-independent because no outcome feedback is available.",

That assumption forces them to favor high-validity coalitions in Experiments 7 and 8, producing errors in the direction of the effects rather than just errors in magnitude. The new model changes the construed direction of validity itself. Its dominant reversed class favors the side supported by lower stated validities, generating negative reliability alignment in Experiment 8 and allowing low-validity coalitions to defeat a high-validity coalition when the raw tally differs by only one vote in Experiment 7. Exact-tally choices are likewise determined by expert identity rather than random guessing. At the same time, the validity contribution is bounded below a three-vote correction, so raw tallying necessarily dominates the five-vote conflicts in Experiments 4 and 6 and other decisive coalitions. Sparse conflicts need not all reverse because reliability is accumulated from the actual discriminating experts before saturation; this preserves graded behavior in Experiments 1 and 3. The small ignore-validity and conventional subgroups provide principled between-subject heterogeneity without introducing trial-history effects. Unlike compressed endorsing-group summaries, the reliability signal remains identity-sensitive and is accumulated expert by expert, while saturation makes the mechanism portable across experiments with different feature counts."
