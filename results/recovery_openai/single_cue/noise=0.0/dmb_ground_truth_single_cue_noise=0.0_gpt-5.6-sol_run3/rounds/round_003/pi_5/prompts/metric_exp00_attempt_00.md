# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

**Rationale:** This 12-pair design isolates expert-by-expert residual accumulation from bounded group summarization while holding the categorical tally fixed. In each of the six base pairs, A is endorsed by m high-validity (95%) experts and B by m-1 near-chance (51%) experts, for m = 2,...,7. Thus A's tally margin is always exactly one, and both options always have at least one endorser. Compressed-Reliability Consensus predicts the same response probability in every base condition: because each coalition is homogeneous, its softmax-weighted summaries are always the 95% and 51% reliability codes, respectively; the reliability contrast is therefore constant, the tally is always +1, and consensus amplification is inactive. Across its parameter ranges, it predicts an approximately 0.55-0.64 A-choice probability with no coalition-size gradient. Uncertain-Credibility Normalized Voting instead preserves each expert's identity and accumulates residual deviations cue by cue. Every added 95% endorsement for A contributes a positive residual, while every added 51% endorsement for B also shifts residual evidence toward A because that weak B vote is discounted relative to the shared prototype. Divisive normalization slows but does not eliminate this accumulation. Its total evidence for A rises monotonically from approximately 1.54-2.17 at m=2 to 2.58-3.52 at m=7, yielding a substantial within-subject increase in A-choice consistency. The critical signature is therefore a strong monotonic coalition-size gradient under the advocated theory versus an exactly flat profile under the competing theory, despite an identical one-vote tally and identical within-side reliability summaries. The final six pairs are exact A/B reversals, balancing response side and requiring the gradient to mirror. With 12 unique pairs, each is repeated eight times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Uncertain-Credibility Normalized Voting theory proposes that people do not treat instructed expert validities as precisely known reliabilities. In the absence of feedback, each communicated validity is shrunk toward a shared, moderately credible prototype. Consequently, every discriminating expert supplies one dominant categorical vote, while the incompletely trusted deviation of that expert's validity from the prototype supplies only a residual adjustment. Extreme communicated deviations are compressed smoothly because participants regard unusually high or low precision claims as especially uncertain, while still retaining limited distinctions among the most credible experts. These residual adjustments are accumulated cue by cue, preserving expert identity, but their total is divisively normalized and increasingly bounded once a clear tally coalition exists. Residual reliability is also contextually gated: it is strongly discounted in exact tally ties, where conflicting reliability claims provide no categorical direction, while otherwise retaining its ordinary residual weight without a special margin-one amplification. Before saturation, total evidence undergoes a moderately convex magnitude transformation, making small vote margins comparatively uncertain while preserving confidence for large coalitions. The resulting evidence is passed through a saturating response transformation, so additional agreement has diminishing effects once evidence is decisive. Between-person differences arise in reliability shrinkage, response sensitivity, and lapse rate. Because choices reveal no correctness information, the representation is not updated from choice history.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Compressed-Reliability Consensus theory holds that people represent every discriminating expert primarily as one categorical vote and encode communicated reliability through a separate, bounded comparison of the two endorsing groups. For each option, attention is biased moderately toward its more reliable endorsers, but their reliabilities are summarized as a softmax-weighted mean rather than accumulated expert by expert. Net evidence is therefore the full signed tally plus an identity-sensitive contrast between the two bounded group summaries. Agreement additionally amplifies confidence as the absolute tally margin grows, with amplification saturating after a decisive coalition has formed. This representation permits expert identity to determine equal-tally choices, preserves substantial influence for near-chance experts, and allows sufficiently numerous weak experts to override the strongest expert. Reliability sensitivity, consensus amplification, choice sensitivity, and lapse rate vary across subjects. Because the task provides no correctness feedback, choices are reversal-symmetric and independent of history.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.
