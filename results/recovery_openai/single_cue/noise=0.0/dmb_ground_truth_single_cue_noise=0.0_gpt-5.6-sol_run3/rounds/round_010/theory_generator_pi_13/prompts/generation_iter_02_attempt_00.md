# generation_iter_02_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_11`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_12`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_11`).

Replace pi_11 with a new Conflict-Conditional Evidence-Construal theory. The central claim should be that people recruit among three psychologically distinct representations according to the geometry of the current conflict: (1) a raw-count representation that dominates when the normalized vote margin is decisive; (2) a coalition-claim representation that can trigger pragmatic reversal when tallies are tied or weak and one option is portrayed as more authoritatively supported; and (3) an exemplar or diagnostic-cue representation that preserves influential extreme experts inside heterogeneous coalitions rather than treating dispersion as global incoherence. Recruitment weights should vary smoothly with normalized tally margin, signed validity contrast, coalition entropy, and sparsity, without hand-coded windows for particular margins, validity bands, or endpoints. The skeptical coalition response should rise rapidly even for small communicated-validity advantages and then saturate, explaining Experiment 1 and the strong anti-validity rates in Experiments 9, 13, 14, and 18. Equal-sized homogeneous repetition should normally be redundant, explaining Experiments 2 and 20 and the near-null result in Experiment 7. Large tally margins should increasingly suppress pragmatic reversal, reproducing Experiments 4, 6, 8, and 22. Crucially, heterogeneous coalitions should be decomposable into salient experts or subcoalitions rather than discounted solely by variance; this can retain pi_12's success in Experiments 19 and 21 while addressing its major failure in Experiment 18. Stable subject-level propensities for counting, pragmatic skepticism, and exemplar attention should be correlated and hierarchically distributed, with trial-level stochastic recruitment, so the theory can reproduce both pooled means and the elevated variance in selected composition-sensitive experiments. Preserve history independence and exact option-swap symmetry, but do not preserve pi_11's narrow-conflict focus rule, additive fixed channels, or threshold-only coherence interpretation.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_11` (overall score: 0.727)

**Description**
Coherence-Gated Relative Coalition Comparison theory proposes that people compress endorsements into option-level coalition representations before making a choice. Each representation combines smoothly encoded mean assertiveness, sublinear consensus, and a coherence gate. The coherence gate is threshold-shaped: ordinary variation among coalition members has little effect, whereas sufficiently extreme dispersion sharply weakens the coalition. Consequently, a maximally dispersed opposing coalition makes a homogeneous coalition relatively prominent and thus a stronger target of skeptical interpretation, without making routine coalition expansion intrinsically reactance-producing. Sublinear consensus is offset by breadth and active-evidence normalization, yielding approximately breadth-invariant comparison of equal-sized homogeneous coalitions. A narrow-conflict focus rule further distinguishes maximal relative contrasts from ordinary singleton disagreements: a smooth 100%-versus-50% contrast remains strongly skepticism-provoking, while less extreme singleton contrasts are attenuated without an endpoint-specific bonus. A separate validity-blind tally channel grows concavely with vote margin. Its gain is reduced while its curvature is increased, pivoting tally evidence away from one-vote margins and toward moderate and large margins. Continuous correlation between tally orientation and response noise prevents high-tally subjects from becoming deterministically majority-following. Skeptical orientation, tally sensitivity, and decision noise vary continuously across people, with composition-dependent heterogeneity concentrated in genuinely dispersed conflicts. With no correctness feedback, processing remains history independent and exactly option-swap symmetric.

**Description**
Uncertainty-Arbitrated Overclaim Construal theory proposes that people form two competing, stimulus-dependent interpretations of binary expert advice. The reliability construal compresses each option's endorsers into a coalition claim defined by mean communicated reliability and an inferred trustworthiness estimate. Coalition breadth does not directly amplify this claim, so repeating an otherwise homogeneous coalition is approximately representationally redundant. Trustworthiness remains high under ordinary heterogeneity but collapses after dispersion crosses a subject-specific uncertainty threshold. This makes an extremely split coalition a poor bearer of a unified claim and can render the opposing homogeneous coalition the uniquely salient overclaim. A skeptical pragmatic response then favors the option opposite that salient claim. In parallel, a social-count construal ignores validity and represents only the raw endorsement margin. Its evidence follows a sigmoid power curve with convex initial growth and a confidence-limited asymptote. A localized confidence-control window attenuates moderate tally margins while leaving decisive margins nearly unchanged. A metacognitive gate arbitrates between the two construals according to claim certainty, coalition dispersion, tally decisiveness, and representational disagreement. Moderate tied claims receive additional scrutiny only inside a narrow reliability-contrast band, preventing the intervention from spreading to endpoint-like equal-coalition conflicts. Precision is selectively reduced for one-vote conflicts and for endpoint-sized bilateral claims supported by two trustworthy coalitions. Consequently, ambiguous conflicts move toward chance, moderate overclaims can evoke skepticism, and extremely dispersed claims remain discounted. With no correctness feedback, the process is history independent. Every computation uses signed option contrasts, guaranteeing exact option-swap symmetry.

### `pi_10` (overall score: 0.631)

**Description**
Coalition-Level Skeptical Consensus theory proposes that people do not compare communicated validities expert by expert. They first construct a representation of each option's endorsing coalition from three attributes: its mean assertiveness, its breadth, and its internal coherence. Mean assertiveness increases smoothly with communicated validity from 50% through 100%, without endpoint bonuses, notches, or categorical boundaries. Repeated similarly assertive endorsements strengthen the coalition representation according to a sublinear consensus function, whereas heterogeneous coalitions are represented less coherently. The contrast between the two coalition representations is additionally normalized by total conflict breadth and compositional mixture. In narrow conflicts, reactance is further normalized when both coalitions make substantive claims or when neither coalition approaches the maximum of the same smooth assertiveness continuum. This leaves a maximal 100%-versus-50% contrast intact while attenuating moderate and bilateral narrow conflicts without creating an endpoint bonus or threshold. People pragmatically react against the coalition making the stronger aggregate claim, so the coalition contrast enters choice with a skeptical sign. This reactance is continuous across individuals and can be weak rather than defining discrete skeptic classes. A smooth breadth-dependent gain makes isolated conflicts less reactance-provoking than repeated consensus, while preserving compression in very broad conflicts. A separate categorical tally channel ignores validity and increases nonlinearly with the absolute vote margin. It is weak enough at ties and one-vote margins to permit anti-validity reversals, but gradually protects decisive majorities without forcing ceiling-level tally choices. A shared continuous reactance trait modulates margin curvature. This modulation is centered and analytically mean-corrected, so it preserves the population-average tally function while producing increasingly large individual differences at large margins. Independent continuous variation in tally sensitivity and decision noise supplies further subject heterogeneity. Because choices receive no correctness feedback, coalition construction is history independent; because all evidence is expressed as signed option contrasts, the model is exactly invariant to swapping A and B.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision — only ACCEPTED candidates have ever been used as the base for a subsequent iteration. Use this together with PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS below to grade which past critic advice actually paid off.

- iter 1: loss=0.1981 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1738 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last ACCEPTED) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1738 — this is the source shown verbatim below under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. Push the next edit's loss strictly below that floor or the gate will reject it.

## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate in this critique loop — i.e. the source the loop's accept gate kept as the best base so far. If your most recent attempt was REJECTED by the gate, this is NOT that attempt; it is the previously-accepted base the gate rolled back to. Iterate on this source — the next critic feedback should be applied on top of it.

**Description**
Conflict-Geometry Recruitment theory proposes that people probabilistically recruit one of three representations according to the current conflict geometry. Raw counting becomes dominant when a vote imbalance is sufficiently decisive, but its response grows sublinearly so moderate and large margins need not produce excessive differentiation. Coalition-claim construal treats homogeneous repetition as largely redundant and produces a rapidly saturating skeptical reversal. This construal is recruited primarily for sparse, weak-margin conflicts containing a salient authority contrast, rather than for ordinary homogeneous conflicts generally. Exemplar construal preserves diagnostic experts inside heterogeneous coalitions through a selective upper-tail representation. Recruitment of this representation responds nonlinearly to the discrepancy between a coalition mean and its diagnostic upper tail, allowing extreme heterogeneous compositions to recruit exemplars without extending the effect to every moderately dispersed coalition. Stable correlated subject propensities alter both recruitment utilities and recruitment sharpness, while the resulting probabilities marginalize trial-level stochastic construal. The process remains history independent and exactly invariant under exchanging options A and B.

`rationale`: This is a minimal recalibration of the accepted three-representation model. The unconditional exemplar-sparsity utility was removed. Sparsity now only modulates claim salience through a smooth sparsity-by-contrast interaction, which reserves skeptical construal for sparse authoritative conflicts and permits breadth-dependent attenuation without imposing a generic repetition effect. Exemplar recruitment was made selective rather than globally stronger: the soft upper-tail temperature was increased, ordinary heterogeneity received less utility, and a saturating squared diagnostic-concentration term now identifies compositions in which the upper tail genuinely differs from the coalition mean. Exemplar evidence was strengthened so recruitment can materially affect Experiments 17 and 19. The count exponent was reduced while count strength was increased, separating the overall majority-choice level from excessive differentiation across margins. Finally, wider correlated offsets and a subject-specific recruitment temperature increase stable between-subject variance without changing swap symmetry or introducing history dependence, margin windows, validity bands, or endpoint exceptions.

## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS
The critic's verdicts on each previous in-loop candidate, in order. Each block ends with an **Outcome of this advice** line saying whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER this advice was ACCEPTED (loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (the gate discarded it). Address the most recent iteration's feedback in your next edit, but down-weight past advice whose candidates were REJECTED.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed three-representation family and improves several central invariances: it closely fits large-margin counting in Experiments 4 and 20, the near-null breadth effects in Experiments 18 and 22, the endpoint nonlinearity diagnostic in Experiment 13, and the strong skeptical choice in Experiment 21. However, the aggregate fit is not yet experiment-invariant. Skeptical claim construal is recruited too broadly or too deterministically: TTB/high-validity choices are too low in Experiments 1 (0.261 vs 0.403), 7, 9, 11, and 12; anti-validity alignment is too extreme in Experiment 8 (-6.003 vs -3.537) and Experiment 10 (0.921 vs 0.862). The very large miss in Experiment 5 (-0.620 vs -0.038) shows that the unconditional sparsity term creates an erroneous coalition-size dependence where equal-sized repetition should be largely redundant. At the same time, the exemplar mechanism does not actually deliver the recommended heterogeneous-coalition behavior: Experiment 19 is near chance (0.538 vs 0.862), and the dispersion gradient in Experiment 17 is much too weak (-0.082 vs -0.325). Experiment 16 is also low (0.668 vs 0.882). Thus the model currently overuses skepticism in ordinary homogeneous conflicts while under-recruiting diagnostic exemplars in the specifically heterogeneous conflicts where they are needed. Experiment 14 is a separate structural failure: its breadth contrast is essentially absent and slightly reversed (-0.015 vs 0.178). Finally, margin behavior is too steep in Experiment 2 (log BF 169 vs 89) even though majority choice is somewhat too weak in Experiment 6 (0.772 vs 0.846), indicating that count-channel margin sensitivity and level are confounded. Between-subject variance is also generally too low, notably in Experiments 2, 4, 6-8, 10-12, 14, and 17.
Rationale: Retain this accepted candidate as the in-family base, but recalibrate recruitment geometry rather than globally weakening or strengthening skepticism. First, remove or sharply reduce the unconditional positive exemplar_sparsity effect, which violates homogeneous repetition redundancy and appears responsible for the severe Experiment 5 size pattern. If sparsity is retained, interact it smoothly with absolute claim contrast or diagnostic concentration so that sparse, highly authoritative conflicts can differ without imposing a generic breadth gradient. A smooth sparsity-by-claim-contrast term in claim recruitment could recover the positive Experiment 14 attenuation while leaving moderate homogeneous conflicts closer to redundant. Second, make exemplar recruitment much more selective and effective at extreme diagnostic composition: increase or sharpen exemplar_temperature and exemplar_diagnostic, and/or use a smooth saturating nonlinear transform of diagnostic concentration. This should raise Experiment 19 and strengthen Experiment 17 without globally boosting exemplars in the moderate conditions of Experiment 16. Third, reduce the count channel's margin exponent while modestly increasing its baseline strength or recruitment level; this can flatten the excessive margin differentiation in Experiment 2 while raising majority choice in Experiment 6 and preserving Experiments 4 and 20. Do not simply reduce skeptic_strength globally, because strong skepticism is correctly needed in Experiments 21 and parts of 16; instead lower claim recruitment for ordinary homogeneous conflicts and reserve it for weak, high-contrast coalition claims. Finally, widen subject-level recruitment offsets or add a subject-specific recruitment temperature/strength scale to increase stable between-subject variance, while keeping exact swap symmetry and history independence.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1981 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1738 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent — address this)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted revision improves aggregate loss and several central targets: Experiment 1 moves toward the observed TTB rate, Experiment 2's excessive margin differentiation is reduced, Experiment 18 is essentially exact, Experiment 21 remains strong, and Experiment 19 improves substantially. These gains support retaining the prescribed conflict-conditional three-representation family. Nevertheless, the model is not yet experiment-invariant. The most serious new failure is Experiment 4: the 6-versus-1 tally choice collapses from 0.838 to 0.307 against an observed 0.821. The selective-exemplar revision is therefore being recruited even when a large tally margin should suppress diagnostic-cue control. Experiment 19 also remains low (0.683 versus 0.862), while Experiment 17's dispersion gradient became slightly worse and remains far too weak (-0.060 versus -0.325). Thus exemplar recruitment is simultaneously too strong in decisive asymmetric conflicts and insufficiently sensitive to the relevant composition geometry in tied conflicts. The severe Experiment 5 miss persists (-0.542 versus -0.038), indicating that the sparsity-by-claim interaction still creates an unwanted coalition-breadth pattern among equal-sized homogeneous coalitions. Skepticism also remains too deterministic in Experiment 8 (-5.977 versus -3.537), whereas minority or high-validity choices remain too rare in Experiments 3, 9, 11, and 16. Experiment 14 now overshoots its breadth contrast (0.302 versus 0.178) and has excessive variance. Count calibration improved but remains imperfect: Experiment 2 is still too tally-like, while Experiment 6 remains below the observed majority rate. Variance is no longer uniformly deficient; it is now excessive in exemplar-sensitive Experiments 4, 14, and 19 but still too low in several ordinary counting and claim conditions.
Rationale: Build on this accepted candidate, preserving the three representations, smooth recruitment, swap symmetry, and history independence. The previously accepted push toward selective exemplars helped Experiment 19 and should not be reversed globally, but its gating must be corrected. Add a strong smooth decisiveness penalty to exemplar utility, such as a negative coefficient on decisiveness or an interaction with 1-decisisiveness, so large tally margins suppress exemplar recruitment; this directly targets the catastrophic Experiment 4 regression and should also raise Experiment 6 without weakening tied-conflict exemplar effects. For Experiments 17 and 19, do not merely increase exemplar strength again: that previous change failed to improve Experiment 17. Instead add a tied/weak-margin diagnostic-cue recruitment term based on a convex or saturating transform of absolute exemplar contrast or sidewise upper-tail extremity. The current diagnostic_concentration only measures exemplar-minus-mean discrepancy and can be zero for homogeneous but extremely diagnostic coalitions, making it unable to express Experiment 17's gradient.

Rework claim recruitment to separate authority sensitivity from breadth sensitivity. Use a rapidly saturating absolute claim-contrast term that is independent of coalition breadth, preserving strong responses to small validity advantages in Experiment 21, plus only a smaller sparsity modulation gated smoothly by very high authority extremity. The present linear abs(claim_contrast) * sparsity term is still producing the erroneous Experiment 5 size pattern and the excessive Experiment 14 gradient. This change should make ordinary homogeneous repetition redundant while retaining limited breadth attenuation for extreme authority conflicts. Avoid globally reducing skeptic strength, because Experiments 21 and 18 are well fit; reduce its recruitment specifically in lower-dimensional ordinary conflicts to soften Experiment 8.

Continue the successful count-channel separation only cautiously: a slightly lower count power paired with slightly higher count strength or decisive-margin recruitment may further reduce Experiment 2's Bayes factor while raising Experiment 6, but the urgent large-margin failure is exemplar gating rather than inadequate count evidence. Finally, do not widen heterogeneity globally again. Reduce exemplar-specific trait-offset/loading ranges, which are producing excessive variance in Experiments 4, 14, and 19, while allowing somewhat more count- or claim-specific subject variation where empirical variance remains underestimated.

**Outcome of this advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1738 -> next candidate accept-status=PENDING (this is the advice you are addressing now).


## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL — MINIMAL-DIFF EDIT (do NOT rewrite from scratch)
The RUNNING-BEST (last ACCEPTED) candidate is shown verbatim above under `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)`. This is the base the loop's accept gate is currently keeping; the most recent critic feedback (see `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS`) should be applied on top of it. Apply the SMALLEST edit that addresses the critic's diagnosis while staying inside the arbiter's prescribed mechanism family:
  - Re-emit the previous source verbatim, then change ONLY the lines needed to address the critic (a parameter range, a normalization, a softmax temperature, an attention scheme, a gating term, a buggy indexing line, etc.).
  - Keep all unaffected functions, equations, parameter names, and the overall mechanism intact.
  - Do NOT rewrite `predict` / `policy` end-to-end if a few lines would do, and do NOT switch mechanism families — that is the arbiter's decision, not yours in this loop.
  - Briefly explain the minimal edit in `rationale`.
If you genuinely believe a larger rewrite is required, you may do one, but justify in `rationale` why the minimal-diff path was insufficient.

  "theory": "Conflict-Geometry Recruitment theory proposes that people probabilistically recruit one of three representations according to current conflict geometry. Raw counting dominates increasingly decisive vote imbalances. Coalition-claim construal compresses homogeneous repetition into redundant option-level claims and produces a rapidly saturating skeptical response to communicated-authority contrasts. Exemplar construal preserves diagnostic experts within heterogeneous coalitions, but is recruited chiefly when tally conflict remains unresolved and a salient upper tail changes the coalition's interpretation. Thus diagnostic cues can govern tied heterogeneous conflicts without overriding decisive majorities. Stable correlated subject propensities influence recruitment, while trial-level stochastic construal is marginalized into predicted choice probabilities.

  "rationale": "This is a minimal recruitment-gating edit to the accepted three-representation model. A strong smooth decisiveness penalty was added to exemplar utility, and both diagnostic exemplar bonuses are multiplied by unresolved conflict. This should prevent diagnostic cues from catastrophically overriding the 6-versus-1 majority in Experiment 4 while retaining exemplar recruitment in tied heterogeneous conflicts. A saturating absolute-exemplar-contrast term supplements exemplar-minus-mean discrepancy, allowing tied diagnostic compositions in Experiments 17 and 19 to recruit exemplar processing even when a homogeneous coalition has zero internal discrepancy. Claim recruitment now uses a rapidly saturating, breadth-independent authority signal; the former linear claim-by-sparsity interaction is replaced by a smaller sparsity term gated by smooth authority extremity. This preserves rapid skepticism for small validity advantages while reducing the erroneous equal-coalition size pattern in Experiment 5 and moderating Experiment 14. Exemplar-specific trait variation was narrowed without reducing count or skeptical heterogeneity. Finally, count power was lowered only slightly while count strength and decisive recruitment were raised modestly, continuing the accepted separation between overall majority choice and margin differentiation."
