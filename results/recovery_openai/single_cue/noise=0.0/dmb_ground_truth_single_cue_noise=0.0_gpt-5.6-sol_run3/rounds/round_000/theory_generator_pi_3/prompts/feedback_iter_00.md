# feedback_iter_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_1`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_2`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_1`).

Replace pi_1 with a reliability-weighted evidence-integration theory, retaining pi_2 as the equal-weight benchmark. The new theory should claim that people integrate all discriminating expert ratings, weighting each cue by its communicated validity, rather than stopping after one cue or counting every cue equally. A principled decision variable is E = sum_j w(v_j)*(A_j-B_j), with a monotone reliability transformation such as w(v)=log(v/(1-v)); choice probability can be generated by a lapse-contaminated sigmoid of beta*E. This mechanism naturally predicts graded confidence from the total strength of evidence. In Experiment 1, lower-validity cues collectively outweigh the top discriminating cue on the conflict trials, but reliability weighting makes that opposition less extreme than equal-weight tallying, potentially matching the observed 0.4033. In Experiment 2, increasingly numerous concordant cues generally increase total weighted evidence, producing the strong margin-dependent profile that TTB cannot express. Allow subject-level variation in sensitivity and lapse, but keep the validity-weighting rule task-invariant and avoid explaining the result as a mixture of deterministic TTB and tallying types. Future discriminating designs should independently manipulate the unweighted tally, the highest-validity cue, and the reliability-weighted sum; this would separate the proposed theory from both existing heuristics.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Communicated-Reliability Accumulation theory proposes that people translate each expert's stated validity into diagnostic log-odds and integrate the evidence supplied by every discriminating rating. For expert j, the subjective reliability weight is w_j = log(v_j / (1-v_j)), and the net evidence favoring A is E = sum_j w_j(A_j-B_j). Thus, a highly reliable expert contributes more than a weak expert, but sufficiently numerous weaker experts can collectively overturn a stronger cue. Choice sensitivity varies across people, while occasional lapses produce validity-independent guessing. Because accumulation continues across all cues, the theory predicts graded choice confidence as the amount and reliability of concordant evidence increase; no learning from choice history is assumed because the task provides no outcome feedback.

`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
def predict(parameters, state, history):
    # Communicated-Reliability Accumulation.
    # state has shape (2, n_features), with rows for options A and B.
    stimulus = np.asarray(state, dtype=np.float64)
    if stimulus.ndim != 2 or stimulus.shape[0] != 2:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Reliability accumulation expects shape (2, n_features); got {stimulus.shape}."

        [0.5 * beta * evidence_for_a, -0.5 * beta * evidence_for_a],

    else:
        probabilities /= total
    return int(np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=probabilities))


`parameters`:
- beta: [0.2, 2.0]
- epsilon: [0.0, 0.2]
- validities: validities

`rationale`:
The previous one-reason account cannot express changes in choice strength after the first discriminating cue, whereas this model's evidence grows with every diagnostic rating. It should therefore produce the margin-dependent behavior needed in Experiment 2. It also differs mechanistically from equal-weight tallying: on Experiment 1 conflict trials, lower-validity cues can jointly defeat the leading cue, but their opposition is discounted relative to a raw count. This places predicted selection of the TTB winner between deterministic TTB and tallying rather than forcing either extreme. The moderate sensitivity range avoids near-universal saturation, preserving measurable differences between weak and strong evidence margins, while the lapse parameter captures occasional stimulus-independent errors. The same communicated-validity transformation is used in every experiment, and only sensitivity and lapse vary across subjects, making the account task-invariant rather than a mixture of heuristic types.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.4593 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.4593.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate moves decisively in the right direction relative to both benchmarks, but it does not yet capture the human pattern closely enough. In Experiment 1, its TTB-winner rate is 0.2963 versus 0.4033 observed. Thus, reliability weighting still gives the collection of weaker, tally-consistent cues too much influence relative to the highest-validity cue. In Experiment 2, it produces qualitatively appropriate margin dependence and greatly improves on pi_1 and pi_2, but the log Bayes factor is only 21.1189 versus 89.1422 observed. The model therefore substantially underproduces the strong within-subject increase in choice consistency with evidence margin. Its between-subject variance is also much too small (0.3461 versus 7.5896), indicating overly restricted individual differences in sensitivity or lapse.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Retain the prescribed all-cue reliability-weighted accumulation mechanism, but recalibrate it. Introduce a modest task-invariant curvature parameter in the reliability transform, for example w(v) = logit(v)^gamma with gamma constrained near but above 1. This should raise the Experiment 1 TTB-winner rate by giving the most reliable cue somewhat more leverage without reverting to one-reason stopping. Separately, the current beta range of [0.2, 2.0] appears too narrow to generate Experiment 2's strong margin-dependent profile or its subject heterogeneity. Broaden sensitivity substantially, ideally after normalizing weights to keep beta comparable across feature sets, and permit a wider subject-level lapse range. The tuning target is joint: approximately 0.403 on Experiment 1 while markedly increasing Experiment 2's margin-based Bayes factor and between-subject variance. Do not replace accumulation with a TTB/tally mixture; the accepted improvement shows that the recommended mechanism family is promising, but its validity-weight curvature and individual-difference ranges are miscalibrated."
