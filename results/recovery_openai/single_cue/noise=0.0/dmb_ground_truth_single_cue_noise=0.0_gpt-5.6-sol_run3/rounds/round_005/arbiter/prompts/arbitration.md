# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_7" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_7" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_7
Credibility-Claim Skepticism with Composition-Sensitive Coalition Fallback proposes that participants distinguish ordinal validity from the credibility of the communicated numerical claim. Moderate above-chance claims receive weakly positive weight, whereas near-perfect claims invite an inflation correction and can receive negative net weight. This correction varies continuously across people. Claim evidence is divisively normalized over all discriminating experts and combined with a robust, mildly convex unweighted tally fallback. Response precision additionally depends smoothly on evidence composition: decisions dominated by the coarse tally are made with lower precision, whereas claim-dominated decisions retain the original sensitivity. This softens overly deterministic coalition choices without imposing exact-tie or margin-specific gates and preserves history independence and option-swap symmetry.

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Latent Validity-Construal Tally theory proposes that participants first encode each discriminating expert as one categorical vote and form an unweighted vote margin. Communicated validities are represented separately as monotonic diagnostic-strength codes whose signed sum is compressed into bounded reliability evidence. Crucially, participants differ in their interpretation of the communicated validity scale. The dominant latent construal treats lower stated values as safer or more diagnostic, reversing the direction of reliability evidence. Small subgroups either disregard the validity information or interpret it conventionally. Because reliability evidence is bounded, the dominant reversed construal can overturn a one-vote tally or resolve an exact tally, but it cannot overturn a decisive many-versus-few coalition. When reliability opposes a one-vote tally, its influence is selectively attenuated if that tally advantage arises from a compact, proportionally coherent coalition; reliability remains nearly unchanged in diffuse many-versus-many conflicts. Reliability-based commitment applies only when validity overturns a nonzero tally; exact-tally decisions remain graded rather than receiving the same categorical amplification. In exact tallies, reliability is further gated by its relative salience: the absolute signed validity imbalance is compared with the total encoded validity strength on both sides. Diffuse conflicts between two substantial coalitions receive little reliability influence, whereas endpoint contrasts involving a near-chance expert remain salient. The raw tally is also smoothly saturated, reducing excessive confidence differences between moderate and large margins while retaining its dominance in decisive coalitions. The model is reversal-symmetric and history-independent because no outcome feedback is available.

**Rationale:** This eight-pair design holds the categorical tally at a one-vote advantage for A while manipulating coalition size and proportional coherence. In the four base pairs, A receives m endorsements from 70%-valid experts and B receives m-1 endorsements from 50%-valid experts, for m = 2, 3, 4, and 5. Under Credibility-Claim Skepticism, a 70% claim has positive net weight throughout the full skepticism range: its weight is 0.4 - 0.128*claim_skepticism, or approximately 0.093 to 0.362. The 50% claims have zero claim weight but still contribute categorical votes. Thus both the fixed +1 tally and normalized claim evidence favor A in every base condition. As m increases, the normalization floor becomes less consequential, claim evidence and its share of total evidence increase, and the advocated theory predicts a monotonic increase in already substantial A-choice consistency. The competing theory's dominant reversed construal makes the accumulated 70% validity signal oppose A's tally. Critically, its special one-vote conflict gate protects the compact 2-versus-1 coalition because its relative consensus is 1/3, but progressively removes that protection for the diffuse 3-versus-2, 4-versus-3, and 5-versus-4 coalitions. For m >= 3, even the competing theory's weakest reversed reliability signal robustly overturns the +1 tally, invokes construal commitment, and predicts a B preference. It therefore predicts a sharply decreasing A-choice profile and a crossover toward B as coalition size grows, whereas the advocated theory predicts an increasing A-choice profile and no crossover. The final four pairs are exact A/B reversals, balancing response side and requiring both quantitative profiles to mirror. With eight unique pairs, each is repeated 12 times for approximately 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is the proportion of diffuse-coalition trials on which the subject chooses the option endorsed by the 70%-valid experts, pooling the 3-vs-2, 4-vs-3, and 5-vs-4 conditions and their option-swapped versions. The compact 2-vs-1 condition is excluded because both theories can favor the high-validity coalition there due to the competing theory's conflict-protection gate. In the retained 72 trials, Credibility-Claim Skepticism predicts that the positive claim evidence and the one-vote tally jointly favor the high-validity coalition. The competing theory's dominant reversed construal predicts that reliability evidence overturns the one-vote tally and favors the 50%-valid coalition. Pooling 72 binary observations per subject should yield low sampling variance, while coding relative to coalition validity rather than display side preserves the information in the exact A/B reversals.

**Rationale:** This 16-pair design creates a robust directional dissociation and a coalition-size gradient while keeping the categorical tally exactly zero. In the first six base pairs, A receives m endorsements from 70%-valid experts and B receives m endorsements from 50%-valid experts, for m = 1,...,6. For the competing theory, a 70% claim has net weight 0.4 - 0.128*claim_skepticism, which remains strictly positive (approximately 0.093 to 0.362) across its entire parameter range. With no tally evidence, it therefore predicts A above chance in every moderate-validity condition; divisive normalization also predicts increasing A-choice consistency as m grows and the normalization floor becomes less consequential. The advocated theory's dominant reversed construal gives the opposite prediction: the positive signed validity sum favoring A is interpreted as evidence for B. Relative salience equals one because the opposing 50% experts have zero encoded validity strength, so the exact-tie gate does not attenuate this signal. It predicts B above chance, increasing toward a bounded plateau with coalition size. Conditions 7 and 8 replace the moderate A coalition with one or three 95%-valid experts. They provide a secondary signature: the advocated theory remains monotonic and predicts at least as much B choice for 95% as for size-matched 70% coalitions, whereas the competing theory's extreme-claim correction changes the 95% net weight to 0.9 - 1.458*claim_skepticism and can reverse its direction when skepticism exceeds about 0.617. Thus the primary result is an oppositely directed coalition-size profile for guaranteed-positive 70% claims, supplemented by a theory-specific moderate-versus-extreme validity contrast. The final eight pairs are exact A/B reversals, balancing response side. With 16 unique pairs, each is repeated six times for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is the choice rate for the option endorsed by the 70%-valid coalition in the 12 mirrored 70%-versus-50% conditions, pooled across coalition sizes 1 through 6. The advocated theory's dominant reversed validity construal predicts a rate well below 0.5, whereas the competing theory assigns every 70% claim a positive net weight throughout its parameter range and therefore predicts a rate above 0.5. Scoring the endorsed option rather than response side combines each pair with its exact A/B reversal, removing response-side bias. Each subject contributes 72 target trials, yielding substantially lower sampling variance than contrasts based on individual conditions or the more parameter-sensitive 95% trials.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.

Pi_6 predicts the correct direction and approximate magnitude (0.201 and 0.236), whereas pi_7 predicts overwhelming preference for that coalition (0.913 and 0.836). The observed between-subject variances in Experiment 1 are also close to pi_6's prediction; Experiment 2 is more extreme and more heterogeneous than pi_6 predicts, but it still decisively rejects pi_7's central positive-weight claim for 70% experts. The broader evidence reinforces this conclusion. Pi_6 is closer in Experiments 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and especially 10; the latter's observed anti-reliability score of -3.537 is almost exactly pi_6's -3.465 prediction. Both theories capture strong tally dominance in Experiments 4 and 8, with pi_7 only marginally closer. Pi_7 has meaningful local successes in Experiments 11 and 12, including an almost exact fit in Experiment 11 and a good prediction of rejection of a 100%-valid expert in Experiment 12. Those successes indicate that pi_6's monotonic reversed code and its hard-coded gates are incomplete, particularly for concentrated endpoint contrasts and mixed coalition compositions. They do not rescue pi_7 overall: its defining claim that moderate above-chance validities retain positive net weight is contradicted repeatedly, while its extreme-claim skepticism alone cannot explain the pervasive reversal for ordinary 60%-70% claims. Thus pi_6 should be retained as the current benchmark, but replacing pi_7 with a stronger theoretical competitor is preferable to merely retuning pi_7's model. The failures are conceptual rather than parameter-level: no permissible tuning can make pi_7 assign negative influence to 70% claims without abandoning its prose claim that such claims remain positively weighted.",

  "recommendation": "Replace pi_7 with a new Contextual Anti-Reliability Arbitration theory. It should propose that communicated numerical validities are commonly treated as socially or pragmatically suspect rather than as direct diagnostic weights: above-chance claims generally contribute evidence opposite to their stated direction, including moderate 60%-70% claims, while near-perfect claims can evoke an additional endpoint distrust response. Unlike pi_6, this should not posit an almost categorical 99% reversed-construal subgroup or exact-tie and one-margin gates. Instead, use continuous subject heterogeneity in anti-reliability strength and a continuous composition-sensitive arbitration rule. Negative claim evidence should be strongest when the validity contrast is concentrated and the raw tally is tied or weak, should be divisively normalized or diluted in dense heterogeneous coalitions, and should lose control smoothly as the absolute tally margin becomes decisive. This architecture should preserve option-swap symmetry and history independence. It should reproduce the very low conventional-validity choice rates in Experiments 1, 2, 9, and 10; permit near-indifference and minority choices in Experiments 3, 5, and 7; preserve large-coalition tally dominance in Experiments 4, 6, and 8; and include an endpoint-specific distrust component strong enough for Experiment 12. To address Experiment 11, anti-reliability influence should attenuate when a high-validity side is embedded in a broad coalition or when opposing evidence is compositionally diffuse, without relying on pi_6's discontinuous special cases. Parameter ranges should allow more anti-validity strength and heterogeneity than pi_6 currently does, because Experiments 1 and 2 are more extreme\u2014and Experiment 2 more variable\u2014than its simulations predict. This new theory would be a genuine competitor to pi_6: both predict broad anti-validity behavior, but they differ on whether it reflects categorical scale reversal with hand-built gates or continuous pragmatic distrust regulated by evidence concentration and coalition composition."
