### slot 1 — `pi_7` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** Credibility-Claim Skepticism with Composition-Sensitive Coalition Fallback proposes that participants distinguish ordinal validity from the credibility of the communicated numerical claim. Moderate above-chance claims receive weakly positive weight, whereas near-perfect claims invite an inflation correction and can receive negative net weight. This correction varies continuously across people. Claim evidence is divisively normalized over all discriminating experts and combined with a robust, mildly convex unweighted tally fallback. Response precision additionally depends smoothly on evidence composition: decisions dominated by the coarse tally are made with lower precision, whereas claim-dominated decisions retain the original sensitivity. This softens overly deterministic coalition choices without imposing exact-tie or margin-specific gates and preserves history independence and option-swap symmetry.

**Rationale:** This is a minimal edit to the accepted iteration-8 model. The cubic credibility correction, original divisive denominator, accepted 1.10 tally curvature, evidence transformation, and all existing parameter ranges are unchanged. The only mechanistic addition is a continuous claim-share interpolation of response sensitivity. Purely tally-led decisions receive 68–82% of the original sensitivity, while claim-dominated decisions approach the accepted model's full sensitivity. This should reduce excessive determinism in Experiments 1, 3, 4, and 6 and modestly lower Experiment 2's overshoot, while largely preserving claim-led endpoint reversals in Experiments 8 and 10. Because the modulation uses absolute evidence composition, it remains continuous and option-swap symmetric and does not introduce an exact-tie, tally-margin, or coalition-size gate. The rejected participation-ratio normalization is not retained.

### slot 2 — `pi_6` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Latent Validity-Construal Tally theory proposes that participants first encode each discriminating expert as one categorical vote and form an unweighted vote margin. Communicated validities are represented separately as monotonic diagnostic-strength codes whose signed sum is compressed into bounded reliability evidence. Crucially, participants differ in their interpretation of the communicated validity scale. The dominant latent construal treats lower stated values as safer or more diagnostic, reversing the direction of reliability evidence. Small subgroups either disregard the validity information or interpret it conventionally. Because reliability evidence is bounded, the dominant reversed construal can overturn a one-vote tally or resolve an exact tally, but it cannot overturn a decisive many-versus-few coalition. When reliability opposes a one-vote tally, its influence is selectively attenuated if that tally advantage arises from a compact, proportionally coherent coalition; reliability remains nearly unchanged in diffuse many-versus-many conflicts. Reliability-based commitment applies only when validity overturns a nonzero tally; exact-tally decisions remain graded rather than receiving the same categorical amplification. In exact tallies, reliability is further gated by its relative salience: the absolute signed validity imbalance is compared with the total encoded validity strength on both sides. Diffuse conflicts between two substantial coalitions receive little reliability influence, whereas endpoint contrasts involving a near-chance expert remain salient. The raw tally is also smoothly saturated, reducing excessive confidence differences between moderate and large margins while retaining its dominance in decisive coalitions. The model is reversal-symmetric and history-independent because no outcome feedback is available.

**Rationale:** This is a minimal edit to the accepted iteration-5 model. The successful exact-tally relative-salience gate and all previously calibrated validity, tally-saturation, construal-mixture, commitment, sensitivity, and lapse mechanisms are retained. The only computational addition is a bounded gate applied when reliability opposes an exactly one-vote, nonzero tally. Its input is relative consensus, |margin| divided by the number of discriminating experts. Compact 2-versus-1 conflicts therefore attenuate reversed reliability enough to restore tally choices in Experiments 1 and 3, while diffuse one-vote conflicts involving many experts receive little attenuation, preserving the reversed-validity pattern in Experiment 7. The gate is restricted to one-vote conflicts, so Experiment 2's margins of 2, 3, 5, and 7 retain exactly the accepted model's confidence profile rather than repeating the rejected additive-consensus edit that inflated its Bayes factor. Exact ties are unchanged, protecting Experiments 5 and 8, and decisive margins are unchanged, protecting Experiments 4 and 6. The tunable floor permits subject-level differences in coalition protection without broadening the core orientation or response parameters.

## Replacement

### `pi_8` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Contextual Anti-Reliability Arbitration theory proposes that communicated validity numbers are interpreted partly as pragmatic claims whose assertiveness can undermine their credibility. Every above-chance claim therefore generates continuous evidence against the option endorsed by that expert, rather than being categorically reversed by a special subgroup. The magnitude of this anti-reliability response varies continuously across people. Near-perfect claims additionally evoke endpoint distrust because unusually strong assurances are perceived as especially suspicious. When an endpoint cue faces a substantive opposing claim, both its ordinary and endpoint-specific distrust contributions are attenuated; against a genuinely neutral cue, both remain intact. Claims around 95% are more strongly compressed in the ordinary channel and do not receive the endpoint bonus, separating near-endpoint skepticism from distrust of literal certainty. Anti-reliability evidence is accumulated separately from the raw vote tally and divisively normalized by coalition breadth, within-side compositional heterogeneity, and sparse across-side claim mismatch. The latter detects heterogeneous singleton conflicts that within-side dispersion cannot detect, while exempting an isolated certainty claim opposed by a neutral cue. A small smooth boost preserves moderate-claim distrust in broad but not maximally dense coalitions. Its influence is strongest when the validity contrast is concentrated and the tally is tied or weak, while it decays smoothly as the absolute tally margin grows. Raw tally evidence additionally receives a continuously heterogeneous, intermediate-margin decision-temperature adjustment. The mechanism remains continuous, option-swap symmetric, and history independent because choices are followed by no accuracy feedback.

**Rationale:** This is a minimal edit to the accepted iteration-7 candidate. The ordinary validity mapping, endpoint range, intermediate-margin temperature, tally mapping, and response transformation are all retained. The main addition is an across-active compositional normalizer. Unlike within-side variance, it remains informative when each side has only one endorser, so it can dilute sparse mismatched claim contrasts in Experiment 8 and related heterogeneous profiles. Its effect decreases quadratically with coalition size, and a continuous endpoint-neutral exemption preserves the successful isolated 100%-versus-50% reversal in Experiment 10. The concentration-floor range is shifted modestly upward to strengthen anti-reliability in diffuse but coherent moderate coalitions such as Experiments 7 and 11. The within-side composition-dilution range is widened upward to offset that increase in heterogeneous broad profiles such as Experiments 1 and 9. These changes express heterogeneity through contextual composition parameters rather than global choice sensitivity, while preserving option-swap symmetry, smooth arbitration, and history independence.
