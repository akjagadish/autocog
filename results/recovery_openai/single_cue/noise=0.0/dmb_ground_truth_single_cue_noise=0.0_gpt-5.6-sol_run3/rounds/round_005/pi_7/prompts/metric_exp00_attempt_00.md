# metric_exp00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## CHOSEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=9):** [0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]

**Trial pairs (n=8):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 4: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 5: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This eight-pair design holds the categorical tally at a one-vote advantage for A while manipulating coalition size and proportional coherence. In the four base pairs, A receives m endorsements from 70%-valid experts and B receives m-1 endorsements from 50%-valid experts, for m = 2, 3, 4, and 5. Under Credibility-Claim Skepticism, a 70% claim has positive net weight throughout the full skepticism range: its weight is 0.4 - 0.128*claim_skepticism, or approximately 0.093 to 0.362. The 50% claims have zero claim weight but still contribute categorical votes. Thus both the fixed +1 tally and normalized claim evidence favor A in every base condition. As m increases, the normalization floor becomes less consequential, claim evidence and its share of total evidence increase, and the advocated theory predicts a monotonic increase in already substantial A-choice consistency. The competing theory's dominant reversed construal makes the accumulated 70% validity signal oppose A's tally. Critically, its special one-vote conflict gate protects the compact 2-versus-1 coalition because its relative consensus is 1/3, but progressively removes that protection for the diffuse 3-versus-2, 4-versus-3, and 5-versus-4 coalitions. For m >= 3, even the competing theory's weakest reversed reliability signal robustly overturns the +1 tally, invokes construal commitment, and predicts a B preference. It therefore predicts a sharply decreasing A-choice profile and a crossover toward B as coalition size grows, whereas the advocated theory predicts an increasing A-choice profile and no crossover. The final four pairs are exact A/B reversals, balancing response side and requiring both quantitative profiles to mirror. With eight unique pairs, each is repeated 12 times for approximately 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Credibility-Claim Skepticism with Composition-Sensitive Coalition Fallback proposes that participants distinguish ordinal validity from the credibility of the communicated numerical claim. Moderate above-chance claims receive weakly positive weight, whereas near-perfect claims invite an inflation correction and can receive negative net weight. This correction varies continuously across people. Claim evidence is divisively normalized over all discriminating experts and combined with a robust, mildly convex unweighted tally fallback. Response precision additionally depends smoothly on evidence composition: decisions dominated by the coarse tally are made with lower precision, whereas claim-dominated decisions retain the original sensitivity. This softens overly deterministic coalition choices without imposing exact-tie or margin-specific gates and preserves history independence and option-swap symmetry.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Latent Validity-Construal Tally theory proposes that participants first encode each discriminating expert as one categorical vote and form an unweighted vote margin. Communicated validities are represented separately as monotonic diagnostic-strength codes whose signed sum is compressed into bounded reliability evidence. Crucially, participants differ in their interpretation of the communicated validity scale. The dominant latent construal treats lower stated values as safer or more diagnostic, reversing the direction of reliability evidence. Small subgroups either disregard the validity information or interpret it conventionally. Because reliability evidence is bounded, the dominant reversed construal can overturn a one-vote tally or resolve an exact tally, but it cannot overturn a decisive many-versus-few coalition. When reliability opposes a one-vote tally, its influence is selectively attenuated if that tally advantage arises from a compact, proportionally coherent coalition; reliability remains nearly unchanged in diffuse many-versus-many conflicts. Reliability-based commitment applies only when validity overturns a nonzero tally; exact-tally decisions remain graded rather than receiving the same categorical amplification. In exact tallies, reliability is further gated by its relative salience: the absolute signed validity imbalance is compared with the total encoded validity strength on both sides. Diffuse conflicts between two substantial coalitions receive little reliability influence, whereas endpoint contrasts involving a near-chance expert remain salient. The raw tally is also smoothly saturated, reducing excessive confidence differences between moderate and large margins while retaining its dominance in decisive coalitions. The model is reversal-symmetric and history-independent because no outcome feedback is available.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This is the proportion of diffuse-coalition trials on which the subject chooses the option endorsed by the 70%-valid experts, pooling the 3-vs-2, 4-vs-3, and 5-vs-4 conditions and their option-swapped versions. The compact 2-vs-1 condition is excluded because both theories can favor the high-validity coalition there due to the competing theory's conflict-protection gate. In the retained 72 trials, Credibility-Claim Skepticism predicts that the positive claim evidence and the one-vote tally jointly favor the high-validity coalition. The competing theory's dominant reversed construal predicts that reliability evidence overturns the one-vote tally and favors the 50%-valid coalition. Pooling 72 binary observations per subject should yield low sampling variance, while coding relative to coalition validity rather than display side preserves the information in the exact A/B reversals."
