# feedback_iter_02

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_13`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_12`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_12`).

Replace pi_12 with a Bilateral Advocacy-Attribution theory. Its central claim should be that communicated validities have two context-dependent meanings. They are ordinary evidence when endorsements are unilateral or the raw tally is decisive, but they can signal advocacy intensity or overstatement when two sufficiently formed coalitions oppose one another and the tally remains unresolved. Skeptical reversal must therefore require smooth bilateral formation; it must not be triggered by a trustworthy unilateral coalition.

The new theory should contain: (1) a default nonlinear tally process whose influence increases smoothly with absolute and proportional margin and saturates for decisive majorities; (2) a bilateral claim process based on bounded mean communicated validity, with homogeneous repetition largely redundant; (3) a smooth coalition-coherence term based on dispersion, without pi_12's hard trust collapse; and (4) arbitration governed by bilateral formation, tally decisiveness, reliability contrast, and coherence asymmetry. In balanced conflicts, the more reliable and coherent coalition becomes the more salient advocacy claim, so skepticism favors its opponent. If one coalition is highly dispersed, it is a weak unified claim, making the opposing homogeneous coalition the salient overclaim and thereby favoring the dispersed side. This can produce the Experiment 19 gradient and Experiment 21 preference without invoking an upper-tail exemplar channel. Large tally margins should continuously suppress this reversal.

Avoid narrow margin windows, endpoint-specific limiters, and a generic rule that stronger validity always elicits stronger skepticism. Include stable subject variation in bilateral-skepticism propensity and choice precision, but constrain it enough to reproduce the low variances in Experiments 2, 11, and 22. The resulting model should predict approximately chance in Experiment 1, above-chance endorsement consistency in Experiment 2, strong tally following at large margins, and anti-validity choices chiefly in tied or weak-margin bilateral coalition conflicts.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Bilateral Advocacy-Attribution theory proposes that communicated expert validity has two context-sensitive meanings. By default, endorsements are treated as ordinary evidence and choices follow a nonlinear raw tally whose influence rises smoothly with both absolute and proportional vote margin before saturating. This default governs unilateral endorsement and decisive majorities. A second interpretation becomes available only when endorsers have formed coalitions on both sides and the tally remains unresolved: coalition validity then conveys the intensity of an option-level advocacy claim rather than literal evidential weight. Each claim is represented by bounded mean communicated validity, so homogeneous repetition is largely redundant. Coalition coherence varies smoothly with within-side dispersion and modulates claim salience without any threshold or trust collapse. Well-formed bilateral opposition supplies a nonzero baseline readiness to consider advocacy attribution, while reliability contrast and coherence asymmetry further increase that readiness. In balanced conflict, a more reliable and coherent coalition constitutes the more salient advocacy claim and is therefore the target of pragmatic skepticism. When one coalition is highly dispersed, it is a weak unified claim; the opposing homogeneous coalition becomes the salient overclaim, causing skepticism to favor the dispersed side. Absolute and proportional tally decisiveness continuously suppress this interpretation. Thus trustworthy unilateral coalitions are followed rather than reversed, large majorities dominate, and anti-validity choice is concentrated in tied or weak-margin bilateral conflicts. Stable but constrained individual differences affect bilateral-skepticism propensity and choice precision.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal edit to the accepted iteration-1 model. The coherence function, tally curve, ordinary-evidence channel, formation rule, precision process, and all unilateral behavior are unchanged. The only structural change is a smooth readiness floor after bilateral coalition formation. Previously, absolute salience contrast attenuated skeptical responding twice: first through claim readiness and then through the signed advocacy direction. Moderate contrasts therefore produced approximately quadratic attenuation, plausibly explaining why Experiment 16 remained near chance. The new floor makes a well-formed bilateral contest intrinsically eligible for advocacy attribution, while salience contrast and coherence asymmetry still control its strength and signed direction. It remains exactly ineffective for unilateral trials because bilateral formation is zero, preserving Experiment 24. To prevent already-large contrasts from becoming more extreme, reversal strength is reduced slightly. This targeted adjustment should raise Experiment 16 while largely preserving the accepted base's fits in Experiments 7, 15, 17, 20, 23, and 24, without reintroducing the rejected breadth attenuation, broad conventional-validity residual, coherence reshaping, or tally flattening package.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1312 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1576 -> REJECTED
- iter 3 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1842 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 1 at loss=0.1312.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed Bilateral Advocacy-Attribution family and achieves several important qualitative successes. It repairs unilateral endorsement especially well in Experiment 24 (0.586 versus 0.576), preserves strong large-margin tally following in Experiments 4, 6, and 20, captures the Experiment 17 dispersion gradient almost exactly (-0.327 versus -0.325), and performs well on the anti-validity effects in Experiments 7, 10, 12, and 21. Experiment 22 is also close, indicating that the model does not impose a generic endpoint-specific skepticism rule.

Nevertheless, the fit is not yet experiment-invariant. The largest failure is Experiment 16: the model predicts only 0.522 preference for the 75%-valid coalition, compared with 0.882 observed. At the same time, it reproduces the extreme-dispersion gradient in Experiment 17 and comes reasonably close in Experiment 19. This combination suggests that the exponential coherence function loses coherence too quickly at moderate dispersion: moderate heterogeneity is treated almost like extreme heterogeneity. Human behavior instead appears to preserve a unified advocacy attribution through moderate dispersion and then decline sharply but smoothly at the extreme.

The model also entirely misses the coalition-breadth attenuation in Experiment 14 (-0.017 versus 0.178). Its bilateral-formation term grows monotonically with breadth while tied tallies always have zero decisiveness, so homogeneous repetition can only maintain or strengthen reversal. The same structural issue is visible in Experiment 18, where the predicted breadth effect is too positive (0.058 versus 0.006). A tied but increasingly broad contest needs some smooth reduction in advocacy ambiguity beyond raw signed tally margin.

More generally, reversal is too strong across several ordinary bilateral conflicts: Experiments 8 (-4.812 versus -3.537), 9 (0.135 versus 0.325), 11 (0.089 versus 0.157), and 12 (0.094 versus 0.126). Weak-margin tally/validity conflicts are also too tally-consistent in Experiments 1 and 3, while Experiment 2 produces much too much evidence for margin-sensitive tallying (192.9 versus 89.1). Thus the current arbitration and tally curves are overly polarized: weak conflicts are resolved too deterministically, either by tally or by skeptical reversal, rather than retaining modest conventional validity influence.
Rationale: Keep the Bilateral Advocacy-Attribution mechanism, but recalibrate its smooth components. First, replace the simple exponential coherence decay with a smooth higher-order dispersion transform, such as an estimated dispersion exponent or sigmoid-shaped decay. It should leave homogeneous and moderately dispersed coalitions relatively coherent while sharply—but continuously—weakening maximally dispersed coalitions. This is the most direct way to raise Experiment 16 substantially without sacrificing the successful Experiment 17 gradient or the heterogeneous-coalition preference in Experiment 19.

Second, add a generic, smooth contest-breadth or active-evidence saturation factor to unresolved arbitration. Even when the signed tally is tied, broader opposing coalitions should gradually reduce the ambiguity that licenses skeptical attribution. This must depend on total active breadth rather than validity endpoints. It should reverse the erroneous Experiment 14 breadth slope and reduce the excess breadth effect in Experiment 18 while respecting the recommendation that homogeneous repetition is largely redundant.

Third, soften skeptical replacement in ordinary bilateral conflicts without changing unilateral trials. A small residual conventional mean-validity contribution inside the arbitration state, or a modest reduction of readiness/reversal for low-coherence-contrast conflicts, would move Experiments 8, 9, 11, 12, and 23 toward the data while preserving the excellent unilateral fit in Experiment 24. Do not simply weaken reversal globally, because Experiments 16, 17, 19, and 21 require strong context-specific effects.

Finally, flatten the tally margin-response curve while preserving its fitted large-margin asymptote—for example, lower the margin exponent and jointly retune margin scale and tally strength so margins 5+ remain near their current probabilities. This should reduce the excessive Experiment 2 Bayes factor. Counterbalance any resulting increase in weak-margin tally influence with the residual conventional-validity term, which is also needed to raise TTB/minority choices in Experiments 1 and 3. After correcting the means, slightly widen stable skepticism or precision variation only if needed: variances are often too small, especially in Experiments 11 and 21, but the ranges should remain constrained enough to protect Experiments 2 and 22.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1312 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1576 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to Bilateral Advocacy-Attribution, but the current recalibration is not an improvement: aggregate loss rose from 0.1312 to 0.1576 and the gate rejected it. The added breadth attenuation and residual conventional channel improved Experiments 9, 11, 12, 14, and 21, but produced larger regressions elsewhere. In particular, Experiment 7 moved from an excellent 0.094 versus 0.116 to 0.231; Experiment 15 flipped from the correct categorical result to the wrong one; Experiment 23 moved farther from chance (0.373 versus 0.500); Experiment 17 lost its nearly exact dispersion gradient; and large-margin tally following weakened in Experiment 6. The already excessive margin sensitivity in Experiment 2 became worse (213.8 versus 89.1). Most importantly, the intended coherence modification barely affected Experiment 16, which remains near chance at 0.532 despite an observed preference of 0.882. Thus the rejected package trades several previously successful effects for modest gains without repairing the central Experiment 16 failure. The model still succeeds on decisive tally behavior in Experiments 4 and 20, endpoint reversal in Experiment 10, the heterogeneous-coalition preference in Experiment 19, anti-validity choice in Experiment 21, and the absence of generic endpoint skepticism in Experiment 22, so the prescribed mechanism family remains viable.
Rationale: Build from the unchanged iteration-1 accepted base, and do not repeat the rejected combination of higher-order coherence decay, explicit contest-breadth attenuation, and a broad residual conventional-validity term. The gate shows that this package over-attenuates broad advocacy conflicts and does not solve Experiment 16.

Instead, inspect and recalibrate the arbitration gating itself. The accepted model appears to attenuate modest salience contrasts twice: contrast magnitude first controls claim readiness and then again controls advocacy direction. Near zero, skeptical evidence therefore grows approximately quadratically with coalition contrast. That can leave the moderate, equal-breadth contrasts in Experiment 16 near chance even though bilateral formation is strong. Use the bounded salience contrast once for signed direction, while giving a smooth nonzero readiness floor to well-formed bilateral coalitions and letting coherence asymmetry modulate that readiness. Retune the corresponding gain and reversal strength downward together so already-large contrasts do not become more extreme. This remains squarely within bilateral advocacy attribution and targets moderate contrasts without adding a margin window or endpoint rule.

A less saturating bounded-mean reliability transform is another compatible, small adjustment: modestly lower reliability curvature so upper-middle communicated validities remain distinguishable. This may increase the advocacy contrast needed in Experiment 16 without invoking an exemplar channel. Check that Experiments 10, 13, 17, 19, and 21 remain stable.

Do not again flatten the tally curve in the same manner; that rejected change increased, rather than reduced, Experiment 2's Bayes factor. If Experiment 2 is addressed now, use constrained stable precision heterogeneity or a small common lapse/temperature recalibration to reduce overly deterministic margin differentiation while preserving the means at margins 5+ in Experiments 4, 6, and 20. Keep the adjustment narrow because Experiment 22's variance is already slightly high. The next candidate should specifically preserve the accepted base's strong Experiments 7, 15, 17, 20, 23, and 24 fits while raising Experiment 16 and avoiding further growth of the Experiment 2 discrepancy.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1576 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1842 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

{
  "interpretation": "The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed Bilateral Advocacy-Attribution family, but it is not an experiment-invariant improvement. Its aggregate loss increased from the accepted iteration-1 value of 0.1312 to 0.1842, so the gate correctly rejected it. The new readiness floor barely repairs its intended target: Experiment 16 rises only from 0.522 to 0.550, still far below the observed 0.882. Meanwhile, it damages several fits that the accepted base handled better. Experiment 15 flips from the correct categorical value 0 to 1; Experiments 1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 14, 18, and 23 move farther from their observed values; and Experiment 2 remains drastically too margin-sensitive at 198.6 versus 89.1. The model still captures decisive tally following in Experiments 4 and 20, the dispersion gradient in Experiment 17, anti-validity choice in Experiments 10 and 21, the absence of endpoint-specific skepticism in Experiment 22, and unilateral endorsement in Experiment 24. However, these successes largely reproduce the accepted base rather than justify the rejected modification. My previous recommendation to add a bilateral readiness floor was therefore not supported by the gate and should not be repeated.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Build again from the unchanged iteration-1 accepted base. Remove the added readiness floor rather than enlarging it: the floor broadly increases eligibility for skepticism but does not distinguish the Experiment 16 configuration, producing regressions without enough gain.\n\nTry a different in-family calibration of the signed advocacy response. Replace the product of a contrast-readiness term and a shallow signed direction with a single, steeply saturating signed transform, for example skeptical evidence proportional to bilateral_formation * unresolved * coherence_readiness * tanh(k * salience_contrast). Use a substantially steeper k together with a lower reversal-strength ceiling. This makes moderate contrasts approximately linear and strongly discriminating instead of quadratically attenuated, while the lower ceiling can preserve behavior for already-large contrasts in Experiments 7, 10, 17, 19, and 21. Unlike the rejected readiness floor, it remains exactly zero when the salience contrast is zero.\n\nTo isolate broad, well-formed coalitions such as those in Experiment 16 from singleton conflicts, modestly sharpen the existing smooth bilateral-formation curve rather than adding total-breadth attenuation. Increase formation scale and/or power enough to reduce singleton formation while leaving four-per-side coalitions near saturation. Jointly tune this with the steeper signed transform: broad moderate contrasts should gain skeptical force, whereas singleton and weakly formed contests should not. This stays within the arbiter's bilateral-formation mechanism and avoids repeating the explicitly rejected generic breadth-suppression package.\n\nA narrowly lower reliability-curvature range is also worth testing because the current tanh coding compresses upper-middle validities; the current candidate did not implement that part of the prior suggestion. Keep this change small and verify Experiments 13, 17, 19, and 21. Do not alter the coherence curve, add a residual conventional-validity channel, or flatten the tally curve in the same way as iteration 2, since that package was rejected. Preserve the accepted base's parameter variation and large-margin tally settings for now. The next simulation should be accepted only if it materially raises Experiment 16 while retaining the iteration-1 results for Experiments 7, 15, 17, 20, 23, and 24; otherwise the targeted transformation has not succeeded."
