## System Prompt

You are a psychology researcher proposing a metric in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is adversarial: propose a metric that DISCRIMINATES the two theories — i.e., its value, computed on data simulated under your advocated theory, should be as far as possible from its value computed on data simulated under the competing theory. The direction of the gap does not matter; what matters is that the two theories produce visibly different numbers on this metric. The metric is computed on the data collected from the experimental design provided in the prompt. Produce a metric where you're prediction will be much more accurate than the competing theory's prediction on human data.

Your metric is a Python function

    metric(data: pd.DataFrame) -> float

Available imports inside `metric`:
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd

The system evaluates your metric in two ways and reports the pair as `point_estimate (var=between_subject_variance)` everywhere downstream:
- `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` applied to the FULL pooled DataFrame (all subjects together) — the canonical scalar;
- `between_subject_variance` is the population variance (`ddof=0`) of `metric(subj_df)` re-applied per `subject_id`, summarising how stable the metric is across subjects. If your metric only makes sense on multi-subject data this will fall back to `n/a` and the metric is rejected (the acceptance test below cannot run without it). Prefer metrics that work both on the pooled DataFrame and on a single subject's slice.

Acceptance rule: the system simulates each theory and runs Welch's two-sample t-test on `(point_estimate_self, between_subject_variance_self, N)` vs. `(point_estimate_adv, between_subject_variance_adv, N)`, where N is the number of HUMAN subjects the experiment will actually be run with (a fixed small number, currently 25). Your metric is admitted iff the two-sided p-value is below the significance level (currently alpha=0.01). Implication: a large between-theory gap is NOT enough — if either theory's metric is also highly variable across subjects, N humans won't reliably distinguish them and the metric will be rejected. Aim for contrasts that are both large in mean AND tight per subject.

Do NOT propose metrics that are trivially true for your theory.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

  trial 3: A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

  trial 6: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 7: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This design tests the theories' quantitatively different breadth laws while holding the categorical tally, validity composition, and mean assertiveness of each coalition fixed. In each base pair, A receives m endorsements from 80%-valid experts and B receives m endorsements from 55%-valid experts, for m = 1, 2, 4, or 6. Thus every trial has an exactly tied m-versus-m tally, and both coalitions are internally homogeneous at every breadth. Coalition-Level Skeptical Consensus predicts a pronounced increase in B choices with m: the stronger A coalition grows as m^consensus_exponent, the breadth-reinforcement gain rises above its singleton floor, and the special narrow-conflict normalization becomes less influential, while broad-conflict compression is only logarithmic. Skeptical reactance therefore strengthens substantially from the isolated 1-versus-1 conflict to repeated consensus. Contextual Anti-Reliability Arbitration also distrusts A, but predicts a much shallower, rapidly saturating breadth profile. Its linearly growing claim contrast is divided by active breadth raised to coalition_dilution_exponent and then passed through a relatively steep tanh accumulator; consequently, substantial anti-reliability is already present for the singleton conflict and additional identical endorsements yield limited incremental change. The critical planned contrast is the increase in choice of the lower-validity coalition from m=1 to m=6: large under Coalition-Level Skeptical Consensus but comparatively small and plateau-like under Contextual Anti-Reliability Arbitration. Exact option reversals balance response side and require mirrored breadth functions. Eight unique pairs are repeated 12 times each for 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Coalition-Level Skeptical Consensus theory proposes that people do not compare communicated validities expert by expert. They first construct a representation of each option's endorsing coalition from three attributes: its mean assertiveness, its breadth, and its internal coherence. Mean assertiveness increases smoothly with communicated validity from 50% through 100%, without endpoint bonuses, notches, or categorical boundaries. Repeated similarly assertive endorsements strengthen the coalition representation according to a sublinear consensus function, whereas heterogeneous coalitions are represented less coherently. The contrast between the two coalition representations is additionally normalized by total conflict breadth and compositional mixture. In narrow conflicts, reactance is further normalized when both coalitions make substantive claims or when neither coalition approaches the maximum of the same smooth assertiveness continuum. This leaves a maximal 100%-versus-50% contrast intact while attenuating moderate and bilateral narrow conflicts without creating an endpoint bonus or threshold. People pragmatically react against the coalition making the stronger aggregate claim, so the coalition contrast enters choice with a skeptical sign. This reactance is continuous across individuals and can be weak rather than defining discrete skeptic classes. A smooth breadth-dependent gain makes isolated conflicts less reactance-provoking than repeated consensus, while preserving compression in very broad conflicts. A separate categorical tally channel ignores validity and increases nonlinearly with the absolute vote margin. It is weak enough at ties and one-vote margins to permit anti-validity reversals, but gradually protects decisive majorities without forcing ceiling-level tally choices. A shared continuous reactance trait modulates margin curvature. This modulation is centered and analytically mean-corrected, so it preserves the population-average tally function while producing increasingly large individual differences at large margins. Independent continuous variation in tally sensitivity and decision noise supplies further subject heterogeneity. Because choices receive no correctness feedback, coalition construction is history independent; because all evidence is expressed as signed option contrasts, the model is exactly invariant to swapping A and B.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Contextual Anti-Reliability Arbitration theory proposes that communicated validity numbers are interpreted partly as pragmatic claims whose assertiveness can undermine their credibility. Every above-chance claim therefore generates continuous evidence against the option endorsed by that expert, rather than being categorically reversed by a special subgroup. The magnitude of this anti-reliability response varies continuously across people. Near-perfect claims additionally evoke endpoint distrust because unusually strong assurances are perceived as especially suspicious. When an endpoint cue faces a substantive opposing claim, both its ordinary and endpoint-specific distrust contributions are attenuated; against a genuinely neutral cue, both remain intact. Claims around 95% are more strongly compressed in the ordinary channel and do not receive the endpoint bonus, separating near-endpoint skepticism from distrust of literal certainty. Anti-reliability evidence is accumulated separately from the raw vote tally and divisively normalized by coalition breadth, within-side compositional heterogeneity, and sparse across-side claim mismatch. The latter detects heterogeneous singleton conflicts that within-side dispersion cannot detect, while exempting an isolated certainty claim opposed by a neutral cue. A small smooth boost preserves moderate-claim distrust in broad but not maximally dense coalitions. Its influence is strongest when the validity contrast is concentrated and the tally is tied or weak, while it decays smoothly as the absolute tally margin grows. Raw tally evidence additionally receives a continuously heterogeneous, intermediate-margin decision-temperature adjustment. The mechanism remains continuous, option-swap symmetric, and history independent because choices are followed by no accuracy feedback.

## DATA SCHEMA
Your metric receives a tidy per-trial pandas DataFrame stacking all subjects (rows grouped by `subject_id`, in trial order). Columns:
- subject_id: Subject identifier (one row per trial per subject).
- option_a_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
- option_b_ratings: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
- response: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
Any column in the schema above whose description names a list / tuple / np.ndarray (i.e. a per-trial sequence of values) holds non-scalar cells. Those cells are NOT hashable, so operations that hash row values fail with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Treating `<seq_col>` as a placeholder for any such sequence-valued column:
- Avoid: `data.groupby('<seq_col>')`, `data['<seq_col>'].value_counts()`,     `data['<seq_col>'].nunique()`, `data['<seq_col>'].unique()` (returns     an object array but downstream `set()` / `in dict` will crash),     `set(data['<seq_col>'])`, `data['<seq_col>'].isin([...])` against list     values, or using a list cell as a dict key.
- If you need a hashable surrogate, project to one first, e.g.:
    - `data['<seq_col>_key'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(tuple)` then group by `<seq_col>_key`
    - `data['<seq_col>_str'] = data['<seq_col>'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(map(str, x)))`
    Scalar columns (ints, floats, strings like `subject_id`, integer     responses, etc.) hash fine and can be used directly.
- Generator expressions inside function calls like `map()` or `join()` MUST be     parenthesized. For example:
    - WRONG: `map(str, int(v) for v in x)` → SyntaxError
    - RIGHT: `map(str, (int(v) for v in x))` or use a list comp: `[str(int(v)) for v in x]`
- Always verify your code is syntactically valid Python before returning it.

## METRICS YOU ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED ON
Each entry below is a metric you previously proposed in this round that did NOT discriminate the two theories at the human sample size — either it errored, its between-subject variance was unavailable, or Welch's t-test on `(self mean, self var, N)` vs. `(adv mean, adv var, N)` returned p ≥ alpha. The `outcome` line is the simulation result (means, between-subject variances, t-statistic and p-value at the human N) on the same `data_self` / `data_adv` your next metric will be evaluated on. Use the numbers to see where your hypothesised contrast collapsed — small mean gap, large per-subject variance, or both — and propose something qualitatively different. Don't repeat the same idea with cosmetic tweaks.

  "rationale": "This is the within-subject increase in choosing the lower-validity coalition from singleton conflict to clearly broad consensus. It pools the m=4 and m=6 conditions to reduce binomial variance while excluding the transitional m=2 condition. Coalition-Level Skeptical Consensus predicts a large positive increase because its narrow-conflict normalization and low singleton reinforcement strongly suppress reactance at m=1, whereas repeated endorsements remove that suppression. Contextual Anti-Reliability Arbitration predicts much less change because substantial anti-reliability is already accumulated in the singleton condition and additional breadth is divisively diluted and rapidly saturated. Coding choices relative to coalition validity and pooling both display orientations makes the statistic option-swap invariant and resistant to response-side tendencies."
