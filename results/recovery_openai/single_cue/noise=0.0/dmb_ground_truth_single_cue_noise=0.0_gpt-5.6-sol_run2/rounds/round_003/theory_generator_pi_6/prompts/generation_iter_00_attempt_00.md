# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_4`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_4`).

Replace pi_4 with a new theory of Exchangeable Corroboration with Idiosyncratic Salience. The core claim should be that subjects strongly compress instructed validities and integrate all discriminating cues with diminishing marginal corroboration, but spatial configuration has no population-level directional gate. Cue order may generate stable subject-specific salience deviations whose population distribution is centered near zero; these deviations should not impose a common early, late, onset, closure, or run-direction preference. Include heterogeneous signed calibration of extra coalition members, allowing some subjects to treat a third cue as corroboration and others as redundancy. This explains the negative highest-validity/TTB agreement in Experiments 3-4 through coalition accumulation, the near-zero contrasts in Experiments 1-2 and 6-7 through exchangeability on average, and the high subject variance with only 44% favoring the early three-cue coalition in Experiment 8. The model should use compressed diagnosticity, saturating summed evidence, a subject-level corroboration/redundancy parameter, response sensitivity and lapse, plus zero-centered random cue-salience or broad attentional profiles. It should explicitly avoid pi_4's population-positive onset and closure gates and avoid pi_5's population-positive entry-versus-exit run asymmetry. Predictions for the two critical contrasts should be tightly centered near zero, while allowing substantial between-subject heterogeneity in overall three-versus-two preferences.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

**Description**
Reliability-Compressed Parsing Mixtures proposes that communicated cue validities are strongly compressed and all discriminating cues enter a diminishing-returns accumulator. Stable subject-level styles allocate attention among reliability, coalition size, and locally parsed cue groups. Display position has no universal primacy or recency gradient: configuration effects arise from chunk binding and weak interpretation completion. In nearly balanced three-versus-two conflicts, parsing is sensitive to the internal ordering of compact and fragmented portions of a coalition; this translation-invariant run-asymmetry can reverse associations with recency-weighted predictions without assigning greater weight to later cues themselves. Balanced two-versus-two conflicts retain sign-varying parsing effects that cancel at the population level. Completion in conflicts between two coalitions of at least three cues is population-common but weak, graded, and heterogeneous rather than deterministic. Signed size calibration creates stable divisions between subjects who treat an additional cue as corroboration and those who treat it as redundant.

**Description**
Switch-Closure Coalition Integration proposes that people encode communicated cue validities in a strongly compressed form and then organize simultaneously supporting cues into directional coalitions. Evidence contributed by a coalition grows sublinearly with its size, so each additional cue matters but has diminishing impact. Attention is configuration-dependent rather than governed by a universal positional gradient. A conflict between two singleton cues receives no positional weighting. When equally sized multi-cue coalitions compete, completing the later coalition produces a small switch-closure advantage because it is the most recently completed coherent interpretation. When coalition sizes differ, attention favors coalitions that begin early and remain locally coherent, but this structural gate is strongest for nearly balanced multi-cue conflicts such as three-versus-two and attenuated when a singleton competes with a growing coalition. Thus positional effects can reverse across configurations: terminal closure can favor the later side in balanced coalitions, early coherent organization can dominate nearly balanced multi-cue conflicts, and singleton-versus-coalition decisions remain governed primarily by gradual accumulation. Subject-specific compression, accumulation, attention, response sensitivity, and lapse parameters produce heterogeneity without trial-by-trial learning, which is appropriate because the task provides no outcome feedback.

### `pi_2` (overall score: 0.538)

**Description**
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL
Propose a novel theory from scratch based on all the information available, faithfully implementing the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed above. Do NOT simply reuse anything generated in past rounds.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- theory: The theoretical claim this theory makes about cognition.
- predict: Python source defining def predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray.
- policy: Python source defining def policy(probs) -> int.
- parameters: Parameter ranges (e.g. "[1.0, 10.0]") or choices (e.g. "{1, 2}"), sampled per subject.
- rationale: Reasoning behind this theory design; used to explain why this theory is better then the previous ones.


## Response

```json
{
  "theory": "Exchangeable Corroboration with Idiosyncratic Salience proposes that people retain the direction of every discriminating expert rating but strongly compress the instructed differences in expert validity. Supporting cues are integrated into option-level coalitions whose evidence increases sublinearly, so additional agreement provides corroboration with diminishing marginal impact. Subjects differ in how they calibrate coalition members beyond the first two: a signed, stable calibration parameter makes an additional cue corroborative for some people and partially redundant for others. Cue order has no population-level directional role. Instead, each subject has a stable, broad cue-salience profile drawn from a zero-centered exchangeable distribution and centered again within the display. Consequently, individual subjects can show substantial configuration preferences, but there is no common early, late, onset, closure, or entry-versus-exit advantage.

  "rationale": "The previous directional-gating account could fit some contrasts only by imposing common onset and closure advantages, producing severe overprediction of the early coalition in Experiment 6 and a large spurious onset contrast in Experiment 8. The new model contains no functions of first position, last position, run entry, run exit, or absolute serial direction. Its cue-salience components are exchangeably sampled and within-subject centered, so early-versus-late and entry-versus-exit contrasts are tightly centered near zero while individual salience profiles preserve realistic between-subject configuration variance. Strong validity compression and sublinear accumulation allow opposing cue coalitions to overcome a nominally best cue without discarding that cue. The signed calibration of members beyond the first two creates a stable population split in three-versus-two decisions: the selected range includes both corroboration and redundancy orientations and is mildly redundancy-heavy, counterbalancing the accumulator's intrinsic three-cue advantage and targeting roughly the observed 44% of subjects favoring the three-cue side in the critical early-three versus later-two comparison. Applying this calibration symmetrically to both options prevents it from becoming a disguised spatial gate. The model should therefore retain accumulation-based reversals while improving the near-zero positional contrasts and high subject heterogeneity that the previous population-positive gating mechanisms could not jointly explain."
