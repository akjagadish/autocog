# feedback_iter_06

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_10`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_10`).

Replace pi_10 with a Partial-Independence Coalition Coding theory. The new theory should posit that people combine coalition evidence using three separable operations: (1) an exact or near-exact duplicate tag that causes strong shared-credit discounting; (2) a bounded, non-transitive diversity bonus for distinct reliability codes, so chains do not collapse through connected-component transitivity; and (3) generic sublinear coalition-size integration without a privileged two-to-three-source release. Duplicate penalties should accumulate across multiple duplicate groups, explaining Experiments 1, 12, and 18, while the diversity bonus and count saturation should approximately balance in Experiment 2 and yield chance rather than either theory's extreme prediction. Reliability should be represented contextually—primarily by coarse ordinal or contrastive ranks rather than a fixed global metric—so majority coalitions can defeat a single highest-validity cue as in Experiments 3 and 4, while broad reliability-gap effects remain weak as in Experiment 13. Stable cue salience should remain exchangeable at the population level, consistent with the near-null onset, recency, closure, and local-spacing results, rather than introducing a generic position mechanism to patch isolated experiments. The replacement must make graded predictions for duplicate count, number of distinct reliability codes, and coalition cardinality independently; it should not implement either pi_10's transitive categories and source-count gate or pi_9's purely pairwise smooth kernel.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Tagged Partial-Independence Coalition Coding proposes that people evaluate an agreeing coalition with three psychologically separable operations. First, they apply a highly selective duplicate tag to experts whose instructed reliabilities are exactly or nearly identical. Members carrying the same duplicate tag share evidential credit, and credit losses are summed across all duplicate groups rather than propagated through a similarity network. Exact matches receive stronger shared-credit discounting than merely near-equal members, allowing exact duplication and local reliability similarity to have separable effects. Second, people encode reliability contextually using a small ordinal vocabulary derived from the reliability levels present in the current experiment. A coalition receives a bounded corroboration bonus for representing multiple distinct ordinal codes. This operation counts represented codes directly and never merges experts through pairwise links, so a chain of locally similar reliabilities cannot collapse transitively into one source. Third, the resulting evidence undergoes generic power-law saturation as a function of nominal coalition size, with no special transition between two and three experts. Duplicate multiplicity, ordinal-code diversity, and coalition cardinality consequently make independent graded contributions. Direct reliability weighting is weak and contrastive, allowing a sufficiently large coalition to defeat the uniquely most reliable expert while limiting broad metric reliability-gap effects. Stable cue salience varies idiosyncratically across people but is exchangeable, centered, and normalized to a fixed within-subject dispersion across cue identities, producing heterogeneity without population-level onset, recency, closure, or spacing mechanisms. Because choices receive no correctness feedback, these representations remain stable across trials.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal refinement of the accepted iteration-5 model. The near-duplicate tolerance, diversity operation, generic count saturation, weak ordinal weighting, and response parameters are unchanged, protecting the successful chance prediction in Experiment 18 and the strong fits in Experiments 12–14. The only substantive new parameter is exact_duplicate_curvature: exact-match groups now use a moderately stronger shared-credit curvature, while merely near-equal complete-link groups retain duplicate_credit_curvature. This targets excessive equal-dyad choice in Experiment 10, duplicate-heavy majority endorsement in Experiment 1, the single-versus-double duplicate contrast in Experiment 16, and the cardinality profile in Experiment 17 without altering the non-transitive classification of reliability chains. Subject variation in the exact curvature also supplies a targeted source of boundary crossing for Experiment 6. As the requested secondary implementation check, centered exchangeable salience is normalized to the fixed RMS expected from its declared uniform profile. This removes accidental feature-count-dependent variation in effective salience while preserving its exchangeability and approximately preserving its prior overall scale.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1599 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.1485 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 3: loss=0.1619 -> REJECTED
- iter 4: loss=0.1298 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5: loss=0.1219 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 6: loss=0.1392 -> REJECTED
- iter 7 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1302 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 5 at loss=0.1219.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed Partial-Independence Coalition Coding family and performs well on several important tests: positional effects remain near null in Experiments 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9; cumulative duplicate structure is captured closely in Experiments 12 and 16; and Experiments 13 and 14 are reasonably approximated. However, the overall fit is not yet experiment-invariant. The largest failure is Experiment 18, where the chain coalition is strongly preferred (0.7344) despite human performance being at chance (0.4983). This indicates that distinct ordinal-code diversity is still rewarded too strongly relative to duplicate discounting and count saturation. Experiment 2 also has the wrong qualitative pattern: the model is near chance and slightly favors the highest-validity discriminating cue (0.0358), whereas people oppose it (-0.2642). The coalition-size effect is too strong in Experiment 1, producing excessive rejection of the top cue (-0.3588 versus -0.1217), while Experiment 6 shows too few subjects favoring the three-cue coalition (0.1600 versus 0.4400), suggesting that contextual reliability contrasts keep some configurations too far from the decision boundary. Duplicate discounting is insufficient in Experiment 10, where equal-reliability dyads are chosen too often (0.3217 versus 0.1723). Reliability/diversity gradients are also too pronounced in Experiment 11 (0.1350 versus 0.0317), and the cardinality profile remains too weak in Experiment 17 (-0.2187 versus -0.3486).
Rationale: Keep the prescribed three-operation mechanism, but recalibrate how the operations balance. First, substantially reduce the diversity bonus and/or make its saturation earlier; the present ordinal-code reward is the clearest cause of the excessive chain preference in Experiment 18 and likely contributes to the oversized gap effect in Experiment 11 and the smaller overpredictions in Experiments 13–14. Second, strengthen exact-duplicate shared-credit discounting by lowering duplicate_credit_curvature, while retaining the narrow complete-link tag. Pairing stronger duplicate discounting with weaker diversity is important: stronger discounting should move Experiment 10 toward the observed strong avoidance of equal dyads, while weaker diversity can prevent Experiments 12 and 16—already well fit—from becoming too extreme. Third, weaken contextual rank weighting, potentially with coarser or less deterministic ordinal codes. This should move Experiment 2 away from top-cue agreement, reduce the excessive reliability-gap contrast in Experiment 11, and place the Experiment 6 comparison nearer the boundary so exchangeable subject salience can generate the observed split. Independently, modestly increase coalition-size normalization to reduce the excessive majority advantage in Experiment 1; tune this jointly with weaker rank weighting because size saturation alone would worsen Experiment 6. Do not add position, recency, closure, or pairwise-similarity mechanisms: the positional nulls are among the candidate's strongest successes, and the required corrections are in-family adjustments to duplicate curvature, diversity scaling, contextual-rank strength, and generic count saturation.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1599 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.1485 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate remains faithful to Partial-Independence Coalition Coding and the accepted recalibration improved aggregate loss. It now fits Experiments 4, 5, 7–9, 12, and 14 closely, while Experiments 1, 10, 11, and 13 moved toward the data. Its near-chance result in Experiment 2 is also faithful to the arbiter’s explicit target, despite differing from the observed negative metric. Nevertheless, the model is not yet experiment-invariant. Experiment 18 remains the largest failure: it strongly prefers the chain coalition (0.7190) when humans are at chance (0.4983). Experiment 6 is also severely wrong and became worse: only 0.06 of simulated subjects favor the early three-cue coalition versus 0.44 in the data, with far too little between-subject dispersion. Duplicate effects are mis-scaled across cardinalities: equal dyads are still selected too often in Experiment 10 (0.2941 versus 0.1723), but the model now underpredicts the single-duplicate advantage in Experiment 16 (0.6310 versus 0.6779) and misses the cardinality profile in Experiment 17 (-0.1960 versus -0.3486). Experiment 1 still has excessive majority endorsement, and Experiment 3 retains the wrong-sign covariance pattern.
Rationale: The previous advice was accepted and successfully improved the loss, so retain the coarser ordinal coding, weak rank reliance, bounded diversity, exchangeable salience, and absence of positional or pairwise-similarity mechanisms. However, do not simply reduce diversity or duplicate curvature further: that produced only a small change in Experiment 18 and simultaneously worsened Experiments 6, 16, and 17. The main remaining problem is the duplicate-credit function itself. The current m^curvature account with curvature near zero gives almost the same total credit to every tagged group regardless of whether it contains two or five members. This cannot jointly produce a strong dyad tag in Experiment 10, partial recovery of evidence for larger coalitions in Experiments 6 and 18, and the graded cardinality effects in Experiments 16–17. Within the prescribed family, replace that normalization with a two-part duplicate account: a strong fixed penalty triggered at the first duplicate, followed by positive but sublinear marginal credit for additional tagged members. Keep penalties additive across separate duplicate groups. This can make a duplicate dyad weaker than it currently is while allowing larger duplicate groups to retain substantially more than singleton-level total credit. Allow meaningful subject-level variation in the marginal-retention parameter so the Experiment 6 comparison crosses the choice boundary for many subjects, rather than globally broadening positional salience. Tune this jointly with a small further increase in generic coalition-size normalization to prevent the restored large-group credit from worsening Experiment 1. The immediate targets are chance in Experiment 18, stronger equal-dyad avoidance in Experiment 10, recovery of heterogeneity in Experiment 6, and restoration of the Experiment 16–17 cardinality pattern without disturbing the positional nulls or the good fits in Experiments 12–14.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.1485 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.1619 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed Partial-Independence Coalition Coding family, and the new fixed-loss-plus-tail duplicate function improves several isolated metrics: Experiment 1 is essentially exact, Experiment 10 moves substantially toward stronger equal-dyad avoidance, Experiment 16 becomes exact, and Experiment 17 improves. However, the aggregate loss worsened and the gate rejected the candidate. The structural edit is too discontinuous: it drives Experiment 6 from severe underprediction to unanimous endorsement of the three-cue coalition (1.00 versus 0.44), eliminating rather than recovering the observed between-subject split. It also amplifies the principal unresolved failure in Experiment 18 (0.773 versus chance at 0.498), while worsening reliability-related contrasts in Experiments 11 and 13 and the dyad–triad contrast in Experiment 15. Experiment 18 shows that locally distinct chain cues are still receiving too much independent/diversity credit relative to the multiple near-duplicate penalties needed to neutralize them. Experiment 2 remains near chance rather than matching the empirical negative contrast, although near chance is the arbiter's explicit qualitative target. Positional nulls remain broadly successful.
Rationale: Because this iteration was rejected, build the next attempt on the unchanged iteration-2 accepted base rather than repeating the fixed pair penalty with a large restored-credit tail. That rejected change created a threshold discontinuity across cardinalities: it helped Experiments 10, 16, and 17 but catastrophically overshot Experiment 6 and worsened Experiment 18. Try a different in-family lever aimed specifically at classification of near-duplicates. Modestly widen the duplicate-tolerance range while retaining complete-link, non-transitive grouping. This should cause the locally spaced chain in Experiment 18 to incur several additive duplicate-group penalties instead of being treated predominantly as diverse independent codes; it can also weaken the excessive reliability-gap gradients in Experiments 11 and 13 without changing exact-duplicate handling in Experiment 10. Couple this with a small further reduction in rank reliance, which should move the three-versus-two comparison in Experiment 6 toward its boundary rather than forcing it across for every subject. To recover the observed Experiment 6 heterogeneity, widen the distribution of exchangeable subject salience or decision temperature moderately, but keep it identity-centered so the population-level onset, recency, closure, and spacing nulls remain intact. Avoid another large change to duplicate marginal credit or coalition-size saturation. Preserve the accepted base's good fits in Experiments 4–5, 7–9, 12, and 14, with primary targets of bringing Experiment 18 toward chance and Experiment 6 toward a heterogeneous 0.44 rather than either extreme.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.1619 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.1298 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed Partial-Independence Coalition Coding family, and the accepted iteration is a substantial aggregate improvement. Most importantly, the previously dominant Experiment 18 failure has been reduced from a strong chain preference of 0.7190 to 0.4410, much closer to the human chance value of 0.4983. Experiment 6 also moves in the correct direction from 0.06 to 0.22, and Experiments 12 and 13 are now very close. The exchangeability predictions remain broadly successful in Experiments 4, 5, 8, and 9. Nevertheless, the fit is not yet sufficiently invariant. Experiment 1 again overendorses the multi-cue coalition (-0.3029 versus -0.1217), and exact duplicate discounting remains too weak in Experiment 10 (0.2802 versus 0.1723). Experiment 6 still has too few subjects favoring the three-cue coalition and too little heterogeneity (0.22 with variance 0.1716 versus 0.44 with variance 0.2464). The graded cardinality profile is also too weak in Experiment 17 (-0.2460 versus -0.3486), while Experiment 15 has the wrong-signed dyad–triad contrast. Experiment 18 has now slightly overshot below chance, suggesting that the accepted widening of duplicate tolerance was directionally correct but somewhat too large. Experiment 2 remains far from the empirical negative statistic, although its near-chance prediction is consistent with the arbiter's explicit target for this mechanism family.
Rationale: The previous recommendation to widen complete-link duplicate tolerance, reduce rank reliance, and increase exchangeable heterogeneity was accepted and produced the best loss, so preserve that direction rather than revisiting the rejected fixed-loss-plus-tail credit function. Make a smaller, coordinated calibration around the current model. First, narrow duplicate_tolerance slightly to a range between the iteration-2 and iteration-4 settings; the current range moved Experiment 18 through its target from 0.719 to 0.441, so interpolation should place it near chance without restoring the original chain preference. Second, modestly lower duplicate_credit_curvature while retaining the same smooth power account. Stronger credit discounting for tagged groups should reduce excessive majority endorsement in Experiment 1 and strengthen equal-dyad avoidance in Experiment 10; keep this adjustment small because Experiments 12 and 13 are already excellent and Experiment 18 must not be pushed lower. Third, generate the missing Experiment 6 split through a wider subject-level range of the existing generic coalition_saturation parameter, centered near its current mean, rather than further increasing cue salience. A broader saturation range can place more subjects on both sides of the three-versus-two boundary and strengthen the across-cardinality profile in Experiment 17 without introducing a population position effect. Avoid another large change to duplicate-credit functional form, and avoid further broadening salience, whose current increase already inflated variance and produced small drifts in Experiments 4, 5, and 7. Preserve weak rank reliance, bounded diversity, complete-link non-transitivity, and the good positional nulls.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.1298 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.1219 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed Partial-Independence Coalition Coding family, and iteration 5 is the new aggregate best. It now captures the central non-transitivity result in Experiment 18 almost exactly (0.5146 versus 0.4983), while retaining excellent fits for cumulative duplicate structure in Experiment 12, weak broad gap effects in Experiments 13–14, and the exchangeable positional nulls in Experiments 5, 8, and 9. Its near-chance prediction in Experiment 2 also matches the arbiter’s explicit qualitative target, notwithstanding the empirical metric of -0.2642. However, the remaining failures are too systematic to call the model experiment-invariant. Experiment 6 is the largest failure: only 0.10 of simulated subjects favor the three-cue coalition versus 0.44 observed, and the simulated variance is much too low (0.0900 versus 0.2464). The cardinality profile in Experiment 17 is also too weak (-0.2128 versus -0.3486). Exact-duplicate avoidance remains insufficient in Experiment 10 (0.2913 versus 0.1723), Experiment 1 still overendorses the majority coalition and has excessive heterogeneity (-0.2346, variance 0.0500, versus -0.1217, variance 0.0117), and the reliability-gap contrast in Experiment 11 remains too large (0.1192 versus 0.0317). Experiments 3 and 15 additionally retain small wrong-sign patterns.
Rationale: The prior calibration was accepted overall, so preserve the now-successful duplicate tolerance and complete-link grouping; Experiment 18 has reached its target, and further movement of duplicate_tolerance risks restoring either the strong chain preference of iterations 1–2 or the below-chance overshoot of iteration 4. Do not repeat the broadening of coalition_saturation as the primary heterogeneity fix: although iteration 5 improved aggregate loss, that specific change moved Experiment 6 from 0.22 down to 0.10 and weakened Experiment 17 from -0.2460 to -0.2128. Instead, try a narrower coalition_saturation range shifted modestly downward. Lower generic count normalization should selectively restore evidence to the three-cue coalition in Experiment 6 and strengthen the cardinality dependence in Experiment 17, while narrowing the range avoids placing many subjects on the high-saturation side of the boundary. Pair this with a small further reduction of rank_reliance toward zero. That in-family adjustment should weaken the excessive gap effect in Experiment 11, reduce the advantage enjoyed by high-validity equal dyads in Experiment 10, and help the three-cue coalition cross the Experiment 6 boundary. Because both changes may increase majority endorsement in Experiment 1, compensate with a modest reduction in beta or slight increase in lapse rather than stronger size normalization; this moves Experiment 1 toward its less extreme observed endorsement and may also recover some of the missing Experiment 6 choice dispersion. Keep duplicate_credit_curvature near its current range rather than lowering it again—the latest downward shift did not improve Experiments 10 or 17. Preserve bounded diversity, additive penalties across duplicate groups, ordinal non-transitive coding, and exchangeable salience, with primary targets of Experiments 6, 10, 11, and 17 while protecting the excellent Experiment 18 and positional-null fits.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.1219 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.1392 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 6 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains faithful to Partial-Independence Coalition Coding, but it was rejected because every intended primary correction failed to improve the running best. Relative to iteration 5, lowering coalition saturation, rank reliance, and beta moved Experiment 6 farther from the observed heterogeneous split (0.08 versus 0.44), weakened the cardinality profile in Experiment 17 (-0.188 versus -0.349), increased excessive majority endorsement in Experiment 1 (-0.296 versus -0.122), and enlarged the reliability-gap contrast in Experiment 11 (0.149 versus 0.032). It also degraded several previously excellent positional-null fits. The candidate still captures Experiments 12, 14, and 18 very well, and its near-chance Experiment 2 prediction is consistent with the arbiter’s requested qualitative target. However, the systematic failures in Experiments 1, 6, 10, 11, and 17 preclude an experiment-invariant account.
Rationale: Because the last coordinated push was rejected, do not repeat downward shifts in coalition_saturation, rank_reliance, or beta. Instead, retain the accepted iteration-5 balance and try a different in-family refinement of duplicate tagging: separate the strength of exact-match shared-credit discounting from the treatment of merely near-equal members inside the existing complete-link tolerance. Add a modest exact-match credit multiplier or exact-duplicate curvature while leaving near-duplicate grouping and its tolerance unchanged. Stronger exact-only discounting should reduce the excessive equal-dyad choice in Experiment 10, temper the duplicate-heavy majority in Experiment 1, increase the single-duplicate advantage in Experiment 16, and strengthen the diverse-versus-duplicate cardinality profile in Experiment 17. Crucially, preserving the existing near-duplicate rule should protect the successful chance result in Experiment 18, which depends on non-transitive handling of the reliability chain. Give the exact-match discount moderate subject-level variation; if Experiment 6 contains competing duplicate structures, this offers a targeted route to its missing between-subject split without globally broadening salience or count saturation. Keep the change small because Experiment 12 is already essentially exact. As a secondary implementation check, normalize the centered exchangeable salience profile to a fixed within-subject dispersion before applying salience_strength, so its effective variance does not drift with feature count; this may reduce the excessive variance in Experiment 1 while retaining identity exchangeability. Do not add positional effects, pairwise kernels, a dyad–triad gate, or another duplicate-credit tail.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.1392 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1302 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

  "interpretation": "The current candidate is faithful to the prescribed Partial-Independence Coalition Coding family, but it was rejected and is worse than the iteration-5 running best. The exact-only curvature produced limited local gains\u2014Experiment 1 moved from -0.2346 to -0.1858 and Experiment 10 from 0.2913 to 0.2615\u2014but neither reached the data, and the change degraded the broader cross-experiment balance. In particular, Experiment 18 moved away from chance (0.5387 versus 0.4983), Experiment 11\u2019s reliability-gap effect increased (0.1429 versus 0.0317), Experiment 13 rose from a near-exact 0.3329 to 0.3958, and Experiment 15 and the cardinality profile in Experiment 17 worsened. The proposed salience normalization also did not solve heterogeneity: Experiment 1 variance remains much too high, while Experiment 6 still has far too few subjects favoring the three-cue coalition (0.16 versus 0.44). Positional nulls remain broadly successful, especially Experiments 5, 7\u20139, and Experiment 14 remains close. Experiment 2 remains near chance rather than matching the observed negative value, but that is the arbiter\u2019s explicit qualitative target for this family.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Because the exact-curvature refinement was rejected, do not repeat stronger exact-only discounting or the fixed-RMS salience change. Build instead on the unchanged iteration-5 base and address a different likely miscalibration: the diversity bonus is currently multiplicative on shared credit. That implementation makes ordinal diversity depend on coalition size and on how much duplicate-discounted credit survives, even though the prescribed operations are intended to make duplicate burden, code diversity, and cardinality independently graded. Replace the multiplicative `shared_credit_total * diversity_factor` term with a bounded additive diversity contribution, scaled in units of mean singleton credit, and then apply the existing generic size normalization. Keep diversity based on the coalition-level number of represented contextual codes\u2014not pairwise similarities\u2014and preserve complete-link non-transitive duplicate tagging. This provides a cleaner route to strengthening the unequal-over-equal dyad contrast in Experiment 10 and the diverse-coalition cardinality profile in Experiment 17 without imposing the rejected stronger exact curvature. It may also reduce the spurious dyad\u2013triad interaction in Experiment 15 and place more Experiment 6 subjects near the boundary. Calibrate the additive bonus conservatively against Experiments 12 and 18, which should remain near 0.669 and chance respectively; do not alter duplicate tolerance, coalition-saturation ranges, rank reliance, beta, or salience dispersion simultaneously. The next attempt should therefore be a narrowly isolated diversity-normalization change rather than another coordinated parameter shift."
