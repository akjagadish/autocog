# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_1" and "pi_2") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_1" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_2" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_1
People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## THEORY 2 — pi_2
People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

## EXPERIMENT 1 (proposed by pi_1)

### DESIGN
**Validities (n_features=7):** [0.95, 0.86, 0.78, 0.7, 0.63, 0.57, 0.51]

**Trial pairs (n=12):**
  trial 1: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 2: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  trial 4: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  trial 5: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  trial 6: A=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  trial 7: A=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 8: A=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 9: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 10: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 11: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  trial 12: A=[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  B=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Rationale:** This 7-cue design creates a parameter-robust quantitative dissociation. On every trial, the highest-validity cue discriminates and favors one option, so Take The Best stops immediately and predicts the same choice probability for that option at every evidence level: (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta)+epsilon/2. In contrast, the lower-validity cues increasingly favor the other option. The tally margin opposing the top-cue winner ranges from 0 through 5. Tallying therefore predicts exactly 0.5 choice probability at margin 0 and an increasingly strong preference for the opposite option at margins 1-5, with probability (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(-beta*d)+epsilon/2 for the top-cue winner. Thus the critical signature is TTB's flat, above-chance endorsement of the top-cue winner versus Tallying's graded reversal as the opposing cue count grows. Mirrored A/B versions control for response-side bias. There are 12 unique pairs, yielding 8 repetitions each and exactly 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is signed top-cue endorsement: +1 when the subject follows the uniquely highest-validity cue and -1 when they override it. It uses all 96 trials, including mirrored A/B versions, so response-side tendencies cancel and each subject's estimate is relatively precise. Take The Best predicts a positive score at every evidence level because the first cue always discriminates. Tallying predicts zero contribution on the two tally-tie conditions and negative contributions on the ten conditions where the accumulating lower cues defeat the top-cue winner. Thus the theories place the metric on opposite sides of zero, producing a larger and more stable separation than a slope based on only a subset of evidence levels.

**Rationale:** This design tests a validity-order invariance unique to Tallying. Every pair contains exactly three A-winning cues, three B-winning cues, and two tied cues. Tallying therefore predicts P(A)=0.5 on every trial, exactly and independently of beta and epsilon. In contrast, Take The Best finds a discriminating cue at validity rank 1, 2, or 3 and predicts the option favored by that cue with probability q=(1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta)+epsilon/2. Thus TTB predicts a stable, above-chance directional preference even though the total cue tally is perfectly balanced, whereas Tallying predicts uniform guessing. The first discriminating cue favors A in half the pairs and B in the corresponding option-swapped mirrors, controlling response-side bias. There are two distinct evidence configurations at each stopping rank and their mirrors, yielding four trials per rank and 12 unique pairs total; each is repeated eight times for 96 trials. The critical advocated-theory signature is chance-level choice across all configurations despite large differences in which high-validity cue favors which option; TTB instead predicts complementary probabilities q and 1-q for the mirrored pairs.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is a signed high-validity-cue alignment score: +1 when a choice follows the first discriminating cue in validity order and -1 when it opposes that cue. Because every designed pair has an equal tally, Tallying predicts independent guessing and hence an expected score of 0. Take The Best predicts the first discriminating cue's option, producing an expected score of (1-epsilon)*tanh(beta/2), which is positive for every allowed parameter combination. Pooling all 96 trials gives a low-noise within-subject estimate, while the option-swapped mirrors ensure that generic A/B response bias cannot create a positive score. The metric tests a behavioral covariance between choices and cue rank rather than merely overall choice proportions.

  "interpretation": "Across both experiments, pi_2 is decisively closer to the real data, but neither theory provides a task-invariant account. In Experiment 1, the observed top-cue endorsement is mildly negative (-0.1217), contradicting pi_1's necessarily positive prediction (0.7129). Pi_2 predicts the correct direction, but greatly overstates the override tendency (-0.6354). In Experiment 2, the observed alignment with the first discriminating cue is again negative (-0.2642), strongly contradicting pi_1 (0.7221). Pi_2 is substantially closer at approximately zero (-0.0008), but exact chance is a structural consequence of equal tallying, so its model cannot generate the reliable negative alignment. The relatively low observed between-subject variances (0.0117 and 0.0087) suggest these discrepancies are not merely driven by a few unusual subjects. Thus the joint pattern is neither one-reason use of the highest-validity cue nor equal weighting of all cues: subjects weakly override the top cue when lower cues accumulate and systematically favor evidence opposed to the first discriminating cue even when cue counts balance. Because pi_1 fails in sign and by large margins in both experiments, it is the theory that should be replaced. Merely changing its beta, lapse rate, or other implementation details cannot make a highest-validity TTB rule predict negative alignment without abandoning its defining claim.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",

  "recommendation": "Replace pi_1 with a theory of salience-weighted compensatory integration. Subjects should integrate multiple discriminating cues, but subjective cue weights should jointly reflect communicated validity and presentation-position salience, with later/lower-position cues potentially receiving a recency or accessibility advantage. Choice should depend on the noisy signed weighted sum across cues rather than the first cue or an equal tally. This can produce a gradual reversal in Experiment 1 as opposing lower cues accumulate, yielding only mildly negative average top-cue endorsement, while position-weighted coalitions can defeat the first discriminating cue in Experiment 2 despite equal cue counts. Include subject-level variation in the validity-versus-position weighting balance and ordinary response noise, while keeping the weighting mechanism common across tasks. The new theory must be distinguished from simple reverse-order TTB: it should predict graded effects of the number and configuration of opposing cues, not identical reliance on the last discriminating cue. Future tests should independently counterbalance cue validity and screen position; a genuine recency-weighting account predicts that the negative alignment follows position, whereas an inverse-validity account predicts that it follows validity rank."
