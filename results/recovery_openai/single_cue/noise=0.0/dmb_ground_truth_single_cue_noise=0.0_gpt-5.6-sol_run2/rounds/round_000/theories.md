## Starting theories

### slot 1 — `pi_1` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by consulting cues one at a time in order of validity, stopping at the first cue that discriminates between the two options. That cue alone determines the choice: the option with the higher value on the discriminating cue wins, and no other cue is consulted. Cues with lower validity are never reached when a higher-validity cue already discriminates, so Take The Best is a "one-reason" decision rule — only a single feature is ever used on any given choice. Because only the sign of the comparison on the top discriminating cue matters, TTB ignores both the magnitude of that difference and all information on lower-validity cues, making it maximally frugal in the use of evidence. Cue validities are subjective and can be learned, inferred from instructions, or fixed by task structure. When no cue discriminates (all feature-wise comparisons tie) the learner has no basis for preference and must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the binary TTB score (winner = 1, loser = 0) with inverse temperature beta, plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

    # of descending validity; the first discriminating cue (strict
    # inequality) determines the winner; if no cue discriminates,
    # the model guesses uniformly. History is ignored.

### slot 2 — `pi_2` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.

    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

## Replacement

### `pi_3` → slot 1 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Accessibility-Balanced Evidence Integration proposes that people encode each communicated cue validity as a subjective diagnosticity signal and combine it with a separate positional-accessibility signal. Diagnosticity favors objectively valid cues, with nonlinear compression or sharpening of validity differences, whereas accessibility can favor cues appearing later or lower in the display. A subject-specific balance determines how strongly each code influences cue weight. On each choice, all discriminating cues contribute their signed evidence to a common accumulator; therefore, several opposing cues can gradually overcome an initially favored cue. Because the accumulator retains evidence magnitude and configuration, the theory predicts graded coalition effects rather than selecting either the first or last discriminating cue. Evidence supporting each option exhibits mild, imbalance-dependent within-coalition diminishing returns before the two directional totals are compared, followed by ordinary response noise and occasional lapses.

**Rationale:** This is the smallest normalization correction to the accepted model. All cue representations, validity-position weights, parameter ranges, response noise, and lapse mechanisms remain unchanged. The only computational edit replaces absolute directional-count normalization with normalization relative to the smaller opposing coalition. In Experiment 1, where one top-cue vote faces a coalition of k lower cues, the minority denominator remains 1 and the majority denominator remains k raised to coalition_saturation, making the computation identical to the accepted candidate and preserving its close fit. In Experiment 2, equal-sized opposing coalitions now both have denominator 1 rather than being jointly attenuated by their absolute size. This allows the existing position-sensitive cue configuration to produce stronger opposition to the first discriminating cue without globally increasing recency or beta. The mechanism remains compensatory and graded: changing coalition imbalance, cue positions, or cue validities continuously changes accumulated evidence, unlike reverse-order Take The Best.

**Parameters:**
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `validity_position_balance`: `[0.25, 0.35]`
  - `recency_gradient`: `[1.8, 2.4]`
  - `validity_curvature`: `[0.65, 1.0]`
  - `coalition_saturation`: `[0.65, 0.8]`
  - `beta`: `[0.65, 1.15]`
  - `epsilon`: `[0.02, 0.08]`
