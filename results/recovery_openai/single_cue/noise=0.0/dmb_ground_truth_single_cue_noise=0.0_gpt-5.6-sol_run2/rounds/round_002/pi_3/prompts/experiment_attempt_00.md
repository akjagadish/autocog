## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist designing an experiment in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Your goal is to be an adversarial collaborator: propose a design whose outcomes would be predicted by your advocated theory but NOT by the competing theory. Both are provided below.

A useful proposal targets a *quantitative* dissociation between the two theories — how they respond differently to specific stimuli in addition to differences in overall performance.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

A multi-attribute decision-making experiment. On each trial the subject sees two options (A, B), each described by `n_features` integer expert ratings (`n_features` is set by the length of `validities` you propose). Choose `validities` — one per feature, each in [0.5, 1.0], order free — to fix each expert's advertised accuracy; subjects are told these values up front. Then choose `trial_a_ratings/trial_b_ratings` (each rating value in [0, 1]) so that the intended decision-making theories make distinguishable predictions: avoid degenerate pairs where every theory agrees, and prefer pairs that maximally dissociate the candidate theories. Validities and the trial ratings together define the design; they are fixed across all trials in this experiment. No trial-by-trial correctness feedback. The total number of trials per subject is held at roughly 96: each unique pair is repeated K = max(1, 96 // n_unique_pairs) times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

Subjects see the following instructions:
In this experiment you will repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. On every trial you will see `n_features` expert ratings for each product (the number of experts is fixed across all trials and is set by the length of `validities`).

Each rating is an integer in [0, 1]. The ratings are displayed as a horizontal filled bar with the numeric value (e.g. "0/1") shown next to it. Higher = more positive.

The same experts (in the same order) provide ratings for both products on every trial. Each expert's accuracy (their validity expressed as a percentage, e.g. "Expert 1 (80%)") is shown next to their rating on every trial AND is also listed up front in an "Expert accuracies" panel.

On each trial, decide which product is of higher quality and press A for product A or B for product B. There is no time limit and no feedback. Note that for the first ~`min_rt_ms` of each trial the answer prompt is hidden and the keys are locked, so subjects first see the full ratings and can answer once the A / B prompt appears — design pairs that actually require comparing the ratings.

Total trials per subject is roughly `MAX_TRIALS`: each unique pair you propose is repeated `K = max(1, MAX_TRIALS // n_unique_pairs)` times in an independently-randomized order per subject.

## ADVOCATED THEORY
**Description:** Accessibility-Balanced Evidence Integration proposes that people encode each communicated cue validity as a subjective diagnosticity signal and combine it with a separate positional-accessibility signal. Diagnosticity favors objectively valid cues, with nonlinear compression or sharpening of validity differences, whereas accessibility can favor cues appearing later or lower in the display. A subject-specific balance determines how strongly each code influences cue weight. On each choice, all discriminating cues contribute their signed evidence to a common accumulator; therefore, several opposing cues can gradually overcome an initially favored cue. Because the accumulator retains evidence magnitude and configuration, the theory predicts graded coalition effects rather than selecting either the first or last discriminating cue. Evidence supporting each option exhibits mild, imbalance-dependent within-coalition diminishing returns before the two directional totals are compared, followed by ordinary response noise and occasional lapses.

## COMPETING THEORY
**Description:** Switch-Closure Coalition Integration proposes that people encode communicated cue validities in a strongly compressed form and then organize simultaneously supporting cues into directional coalitions. Evidence contributed by a coalition grows sublinearly with its size, so each additional cue matters but has diminishing impact. Attention is configuration-dependent rather than governed by a universal positional gradient. A conflict between two singleton cues receives no positional weighting. When equally sized multi-cue coalitions compete, completing the later coalition produces a small switch-closure advantage because it is the most recently completed coherent interpretation. When coalition sizes differ, attention favors coalitions that begin early and remain locally coherent, but this structural gate is strongest for nearly balanced multi-cue conflicts such as three-versus-two and attenuated when a singleton competes with a growing coalition. Thus positional effects can reverse across configurations: terminal closure can favor the later side in balanced coalitions, early coherent organization can dominate nearly balanced multi-cue conflicts, and singleton-versus-coalition decisions remain governed primarily by gradual accumulation. Subject-specific compression, accumulation, attention, response sensitivity, and lapse parameters produce heterogeneity without trial-by-trial learning, which is appropriate because the task provides no outcome feedback.

## ALREADY-EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS (do not repeat)
[0] This 7-cue design creates a parameter-robust quantitative dissociation. On every trial, the highest-validity cue discriminates and favors one option, so Take The Best stops immediately and predicts the same choice probability for that option at every evidence level: (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta)+epsilon/2. In contrast, the lower-validity cues increasingly favor the other option. The tally margin opposing the top-cue winner ranges from 0 through 5. Tallying therefore predicts exactly 0.5 choice probability at margin 0 and an increasingly strong preference for the opposite option at margins 1-5, with probability (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(-beta*d)+epsilon/2 for the top-cue winner. Thus the critical signature is TTB's flat, above-chance endorsement of the top-cue winner versus Tallying's graded reversal as the opposing cue count grows. Mirrored A/B versions control for response-side bias. There are 12 unique pairs, yielding 8 repetitions each and exactly 96 trials.

[1] This design tests a validity-order invariance unique to Tallying. Every pair contains exactly three A-winning cues, three B-winning cues, and two tied cues. Tallying therefore predicts P(A)=0.5 on every trial, exactly and independently of beta and epsilon. In contrast, Take The Best finds a discriminating cue at validity rank 1, 2, or 3 and predicts the option favored by that cue with probability q=(1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta)+epsilon/2. Thus TTB predicts a stable, above-chance directional preference even though the total cue tally is perfectly balanced, whereas Tallying predicts uniform guessing. The first discriminating cue favors A in half the pairs and B in the corresponding option-swapped mirrors, controlling response-side bias. There are two distinct evidence configurations at each stopping rank and their mirrors, yielding four trials per rank and 12 unique pairs total; each is repeated eight times for 96 trials. The critical advocated-theory signature is chance-level choice across all configurations despite large differences in which high-validity cue favors which option; TTB instead predicts complementary probabilities q and 1-q for the mirrored pairs.

[2] This 7-cue design holds the tally margin constant while systematically relocating the same 3-versus-2 cue coalition from early, low-validity positions to late, high-validity positions. In each of the first six pairs, A wins exactly three cues, B wins exactly two, and two cues tie. Tallying therefore predicts exactly the same A-choice probability on all six: (1-epsilon)*sigmoid(beta)+epsilon/2. The final six pairs are A/B-swapped mirrors, for which Tallying predicts the complementary constant probability. Accessibility-Balanced Evidence Integration instead assigns progressively greater weight to later cues; the ascending validities reinforce this positional gradient throughout the advocated parameter ranges. Consequently, its predicted A-choice probability should increase monotonically across the first six configurations. At the low end, A's three early wins should be overcome by B's two late wins, reversing the tally preference; at the high end, A's late coalition should produce a strong A preference. Coalition saturation further penalizes A's three-cue majority relative to B's two-cue coalition but is constant in form across the progression. The mirrored pairs should exhibit the complementary graded pattern, controlling response-side bias. Thus the decisive signature is a large configuration-dependent slope, including a preference reversal despite an invariant tally margin; Tallying permits neither. There are 12 unique pairs, each repeated eight times, yielding exactly 96 trials.

[3] This design isolates a positional-accessibility gradient while holding both cue tally and diagnosticity exactly constant. In each of the first six pairs, A wins one cue and B wins one cue, so Tallying predicts P(A)=0.5 exactly, independently of beta and epsilon. B's win is always at Expert 2 (index 1), whereas A's win moves successively from Expert 3 through Expert 8 (indices 2-7). All of these discriminating experts have identical advertised validity (0.70), so their diagnosticity components are equal. Accessibility-Balanced Evidence Integration therefore predicts a strictly increasing A-choice probability as A's supporting cue moves later: its evidence difference is proportional to accessibility(target)-accessibility(index 1). Coalition saturation is inactive because the coalitions are always one cue versus one cue. Across the competing theory's parameter ranges, the nearest-position contrast should be only slightly above chance (approximately 0.51-0.52), while the most separated contrast should produce approximately 0.62-0.79 A choices. The final six pairs swap A and B, yielding complementary predictions and controlling response-side bias. The high- and low-validity experts provide the required communicated validity spread but are tied in these trials, ensuring that the graded competing-theory prediction is specifically attributable to positional accessibility rather than validity. There are 12 unique pairs, each repeated eight times for 96 trials.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- rationale: Reasoning behind this experimental design; used when interpreting results.
- validities: Per-expert validities, one per feature. Each must be in [0.5, 1.0]; order is free (no descending requirement — theories that depend on validity order re-sort internally). Length determines n_features for the whole experiment and must match the rating-list length in every trial pair. Pick a spread (at least one high validity and at least one low one) — uniform validities (e.g. all 0.7) make many candidate theories indistinguishable, so spread them out.
- trial_a_ratings: List of option-A rating vectors, one per trial. Each inner list has length equal to len(validities); each value is binary (0 or 1). `trial_a_ratings[i]` pairs with `trial_b_ratings[i]` on trial i.
- trial_b_ratings: List of option-B rating vectors, one per trial. Same length and shape constraints as `trial_a_ratings`. Pick trials that let the intended theories be dissociated; avoid trials where every theory agrees.

  "rationale": "This 10-cue design pits universal positional accessibility against switch-closure in balanced two-versus-two conflicts. Experts 1 and 4-10 all have validity 0.70; only these equal-validity experts discriminate. Experts 2 and 3 provide the required validity spread (0.95 and 0.55) but are tied, so validity differences cannot explain choices. In each of the first six pairs, A is supported by two cues including the final discriminating cue, whereas B is supported by two cues whose combined positions are later on average. Switch-Closure Coalition Integration enters its balanced-coalition branch: because A supplies the final discriminating cue and all four discriminating cues have identical validity, it predicts the same above-chance A-choice probability for all six configurations (approximately 0.58-0.66 across its parameter ranges), irrespective of spacing. Accessibility-Balanced Evidence Integration instead sums the cues' exponentially increasing positional weights. In every pair, B's two adjacent late cues have greater total accessibility than A's early-plus-terminal pair, so it robustly predicts P(A)<0.5. It additionally predicts graded changes as A's early cue moves later and the accessibility deficit shrinks, whereas the competing theory remains flat because coalition size and closure direction are unchanged. The final six pairs are exact A/B mirrors, producing complementary predictions and controlling response-side bias. Thus the decisive signature is a sign reversal\u2014advocated-theory preference for B versus competing-theory preference for A\u2014together with a graded spacing effect predicted only by the advocated theory.
