# feedback_iter_06

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_11`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_13`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 2 (= `pi_13`).

Replace pi_13 with a new theory of Coherence-Constrained Source Clustering. Observers should infer a small set of latent reliability strata for each agreeing coalition rather than classify every positive gap as individuation evidence. Coalition value should combine: (1) weak contextual reliability weighting; (2) a redundancy cost when multiple experts are assigned to one exact or near-exact source; (3) an independence benefit for distinguishable sources; (4) a consensus-coherence term that declines when individuated sources are too dispersed; and (5) a structural-compressibility bonus when several observations support a small, balanced set of reliability clusters. This creates a Goldilocks relation between reliability gap and corroboration rather than either theory's monotonic rule. An exact dyad can be treated as one redundant source, a slightly nonidentical dyad as coherent independent corroboration, and a broader dyad as less consensual, addressing Experiments 2 and 24. A tetrad with two replicated endpoints can be represented as two well-supported source strata and beat four weakly supported singleton levels, addressing Experiment 1, while a second duplicate group can still incur an accumulating redundancy cost as in Experiment 18. The theory should retain exchangeable cue salience, smooth cardinality saturation, and no intrinsic position, onset, closure, or recency gradient, preserving the many null positional results. Its model should use continuous Bayesian or soft-clustering assignments, a nonmonotonic gap-to-corroboration function, and separate parameters for within-cluster redundancy, between-cluster coherence, cluster-support confidence, and capacity saturation. Parameter ranges should permit strong narrow-over-broad and patterned-over-unstructured preferences without forcing broad reliability-gap effects in Experiments 13 and 20–22.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Coherence-Constrained Reliability-Strata Inference proposes that observers interpret an agreeing coalition by inferring a compact posterior distribution over latent reliability strata. Experts are assigned continuously rather than categorically to one through four possible source strata. Exact or virtually exact experts have a high probability of sharing a source and therefore incur accumulating redundancy. A small but nonzero reliability difference instead provides maximal corroboration because it supports distinguishable sources that remain mutually coherent. Larger separations progressively lose consensus coherence, producing a Goldilocks-shaped relation between reliability gap and coalition value. Coalition structure also matters: a small, balanced collection of compact strata supported by multiple experts is easier to compress and receives greater confidence than either one undifferentiated duplicate mass or many weakly supported singleton levels. Replication protection is granted only when posterior cluster mass is concentrated tightly around a stratum center; diffuse chains cannot obtain this protection merely through broad coassignment. For coalitions beyond triadic capacity, independence credit is pooled at the latent-stratum level and limited by the strongest compact, balanced, supported relation between distinguishishable strata, weighted by how completely those two strata cover the coalition. Thus an isolated favorable link cannot confer full corroboration when substantial posterior mass remains in unsupported residual strata. A dyad can progress from redundant at equality, to coherently corroborative at a narrow gap, and back toward weak consensus at a broader gap. A replicated two-stratum tetrad can outperform four unsupported reliability levels, although each compact stratum's excess membership adds a separate redundancy cost. Instructed reliability has a weak but consequential bounded influence after compression. Coalition magnitude saturates smoothly under finite capacity, with a modest heterogeneous corroborative release at the two-to-three transition that decays beyond three. Exchangeable idiosyncratic cue salience introduces individual variation without population-level position, onset, closure, adjacency, or recency effects.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal edit to the accepted iteration-6 candidate. The successful dyadic Goldilocks function, soft-clustering posterior, compact-replication criterion, redundancy statistics, validity representation, and count saturation are retained. The principal code change multiplies each stratum-level corroboration link by the posterior mass covered by its two participating strata. A balanced 2+2 representation retains full coverage, whereas a favorable pair embedded in a chain or singleton-rich tetrad is discounted for residual coalition mass. The transition from expert-pair corroboration to this coverage-limited credit is also made modestly faster only beyond triadic capacity. Dyads and triads are therefore mathematically unchanged by the aggregation edit, protecting Experiment 22 and the existing three-cue mechanism while selectively targeting the remaining overvaluation in Experiments 18, 20, 21, and 23. No global-span gate, post-clustering mean-quality bonus, or separate duplicate-stratum surcharge is reintroduced, because that rejected package damaged Experiments 1 and 12–16. The only parameter adjustments are a small widening of the isolated triad-transition gain to increase subject-level variation around the Experiment 6 boundary, and a narrower salience-strength range to reduce excessive idiosyncratic variance in Experiments 1 and 22 without adding any positional mechanism. The existing compact-excess statistic and cost are left unchanged because its required ordering was not established strongly enough to justify another redundancy intervention.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.2497 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2: loss=0.2525 -> REJECTED
- iter 3: loss=0.2471 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 4: loss=0.2329 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 5: loss=0.2705 -> REJECTED
- iter 6: loss=0.2269 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 7 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.2338 -> REJECTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 6 at loss=0.2269.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed coherence-constrained clustering family and improves substantially on pi_13 in several critical tests, including Experiments 1, 15, 22, and 23. It also preserves the intended positional nulls in Experiments 4, 5, and 7–9. However, the central Goldilocks relation is not calibrated correctly. Broad or chain-like reliability structures remain too valuable: broad-choice rates are 0.569 versus 0.321 in Experiment 24, the wide-minus-narrow contrast is +0.101 versus -0.028 in Experiment 19, and chain choices are 0.734 versus 0.498 and 0.746 versus 0.504 in Experiments 18 and 20. The corresponding aversion to fully separated tetrads is also much too weak in Experiment 23 (-0.055 versus -0.354). At the same time, the desired narrow-gap advantage is slightly too weak in Experiment 22 (0.634 versus 0.682). Thus the implemented relation is too broad, not merely too weak. Important structural and cardinality patterns also remain underfit: Experiments 2, 6, 10, 12–14, 16, and 17 all show large discrepancies. In particular, the model is nearly indifferent in Experiment 2, almost categorically rejects the three-cue coalition in Experiment 6, underproduces distributed-coalition preferences in Experiments 12–14, and does not generate enough accumulating duplicate cost in Experiment 16. Between-subject behavior is also too categorical in Experiment 6 and too homogeneous in Experiment 21.
Rationale: Continue within the current mechanism family, but sharpen and renormalize its components. First, move the corroboration peak firmly toward the narrow-gap regime and reduce its width; the present peak range up to .011 and coherence widths up to .040 allow the .014 broad dyads in Experiment 24 to remain corroborative with little dispersion penalty. A narrower peak near .004–.006, narrower corroboration width, and an earlier/stronger coherence decline should simultaneously lower Experiments 19, 20, and 24, make Experiment 23 more negative, and preserve or strengthen Experiment 22. Second, fix the soft-clustering/compressibility calculation so diffuse chains cannot be represented as a few artificially well-supported strata merely because assignments are broad. Use effective occupied, distinguishable clusters rather than nominal k, tighten cluster assignments, and penalize overlapping or weakly separated centers. Reserve the compressibility bonus for balanced clusters with genuine replicated support. Third, replace the current pair-count-divided-by-n redundancy normalization with posterior expected excess membership within sources, such as a smooth sum over cluster masses above one. This lets a second duplicate group add cost as required by Experiments 16 and 18 while keeping that cost distinct from broad-gap incoherence. Counterbalance this with a somewhat stronger but smoothly saturating count term so exact triads are not almost universally beaten by dyads in Experiment 6. Independence benefits should saturate more strongly with coalition cardinality, reducing the excessive tetrad-diversity rate in Experiment 21 without sacrificing the dyadic near-over-exact effect in Experiment 22. These are parameterization and normalization corrections to the prescribed coherence-constrained source-clustering model, not a change of mechanism family.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.2497 -> iter 2 candidate loss=0.2525 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 2
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains faithful to Coherence-Constrained Source Clustering, but it was rejected by the accept gate (loss 0.2525 versus the accepted base’s 0.2497). The previous broad intervention improved the intended broad/chain diagnostics—Experiments 18, 20, and 24 moved substantially toward the data, and Experiment 16 also improved—but these gains were outweighed by severe regressions elsewhere. Experiment 1 reversed from a near-correct majority preference (-0.091 versus -0.122) to an incorrect top-cue preference (+0.105). Experiment 10’s already excessive preference for exact dyads rose from 0.430 to 0.598 against 0.172. The narrow-over-exact effect in Experiment 22 collapsed from 0.634 to 0.508 against 0.682. Experiments 12–14 moved farther from their distributed-coalition effects, and Experiment 17 changed sign and became markedly worse. Experiment 15 also developed an excessive cardinality interaction. Thus the revised clustering penalties suppress not only broad incoherent coalitions but also the narrow, distributed, and majority coalitions that should retain value. Major failures remain in Experiments 2, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 23, with especially categorical under-selection of the three-cue coalition in Experiment 6 and inadequate aversion to fully separated tetrads in Experiment 23. Positional nulls in Experiments 4, 5, and 7–9 remain appropriately preserved.
Rationale: Because the last package of stronger coherence, accumulated redundancy, tighter clustering, and altered cardinality saturation was rejected, do not repeat that package or push those parameters farther. Build from the unchanged accepted iteration-1 base and make a smaller, more selective correction. The key implementation problem is that narrow-gap independence is multiplied by posterior distinctness: with cluster widths overlapping the .004–.006 regime, near-duplicate experts can remain highly coassigned, eliminating the very corroboration peak needed in Experiment 22. Meanwhile, a generic dispersion penalty can overpower reliability quality in Experiment 10. Use the currently loaded but effectively unused `redundancy_width` to define a direct smooth resolution gate, such as `1-exp(-gap^2/(2*redundancy_width^2))`, and apply it to the Goldilocks benefit independently of posterior coassignment. Keep exact gaps redundant, make .004–.006 gaps reliably distinguishable, and add only a bounded tail penalty beyond the narrow peak. Do not globally replace iteration 1’s redundancy normalization or count term again. To distinguish Experiment 10 from low-reliability broad-gap tests such as Experiment 24, let the prescribed weak contextual reliability component moderate the tail penalty: a coalition with a substantial mean-quality advantage should not be rejected solely for internal spread, whereas equally strong coalitions should be decided by coherence. This contextual moderation should be local to structural valuation rather than a global increase in cue validity reliance, which could worsen Experiments 1 and 2. For larger coalitions, reserve strong incoherence penalties for genuinely unsupported singleton-like partitions using effective occupied clusters; retain the accepted base’s treatment of replicated or majority-supported structure so Experiments 1, 15, 17, and 22 are not sacrificed again. Finally, Experiment 6 requires heterogeneity around the three-versus-two boundary rather than a uniform shift: modestly widen subject-level capacity or count-curvature ranges around the accepted settings, without increasing exchangeable salience or introducing position. This is a targeted recalibration within the prescribed clustering family.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 2 candidate loss=0.2525 -> iter 3 candidate loss=0.2471 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 3
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The accepted candidate is a genuine improvement and remains faithful to Coherence-Constrained Source Clustering. The direct resolution gate successfully captures the central near-over-exact result in Experiment 22 almost perfectly (0.681 versus 0.682), improves the broad-gap result in Experiment 24 relative to iteration 1, and moves Experiment 23 in the correct negative direction. It also preserves the required positional nulls in Experiments 4, 5, and 7–9. Nevertheless, the fit is not yet experiment-invariant. Broad or chain-like coalitions remain substantially overvalued in Experiments 18 and 20 (0.737 and 0.752 versus approximately 0.50), and wide dyads are preferred rather than weakly disfavored in Experiment 19 (+0.125 versus -0.028). The model also still strongly underestimates broad-over-narrow rejection in Experiment 24 (0.422 versus 0.321) and separated-tetrad rejection in Experiment 23 (-0.096 versus -0.354). Separately, its weak reliability representation leaves it near chance where humans systematically favor particular reliability configurations in Experiments 12–14, and it chooses exact dyads far too often in Experiment 10 (0.474 versus 0.172). Cardinality and redundancy remain miscalibrated: only 8% rather than 44% of subjects favor the three-cue coalition in Experiment 6; the single-duplicate advantage in Experiment 16 is absent (0.504 versus 0.678); and the cardinality profile in Experiment 17 is much too shallow. Experiment 2 also remains essentially at chance rather than showing the observed opposition to the highest-validity discriminating cue. Thus the accepted gain is real but concentrated around Experiment 22 rather than constituting a satisfactory cross-experiment account.
Rationale: Build on the accepted iteration-3 model and preserve its direct narrow-gap resolution gate; that targeted change was validated by the gate and should not be undone. The next revision should use different, selective in-family adjustments rather than repeating the rejected iteration-1 package of globally tighter clustering and stronger coherence penalties. First, the current `replication_guard` is too permissive: posterior coassignment alone lets smooth chains masquerade as replicated strata, shielding them from dispersion in Experiments 18 and 20. Define replicated support using actual concentrated mass around a center—combining posterior mass with low within-cluster variance or close-pair similarity—and grant protection only to compact, well-supported strata. This should retain the replicated-endpoint benefit required by Experiment 1 while removing protection from chains and unsupported dispersed tetrads. Apply only a modest additional tail penalty around gaps of roughly .014 and above to continue the accepted improvement in Experiments 19, 23, and 24 without narrowing the .004–.006 peak that now fits Experiment 22.

Second, the local quality guard has not supplied enough reliability sensitivity. Modestly raise the lower and upper bounds of `validity_reliance` or reduce validity compression slightly, rather than making a large change. Greater contextual quality influence should move Experiment 1 back toward -0.122, help unequal high-quality dyads defeat exact dyads in Experiment 10, and recover the reliability-configuration effects in Experiments 12–14. Keep this contribution bounded at the coalition level so it does not generate the broad monotonic gap effects the arbiter warned against.

Third, adjust smooth cardinality saturation specifically at the two-to-three transition: slightly increase count credit there while retaining strong saturation beyond three. The present range moved Experiment 6 only from 0.02 to 0.08, so its population is still far from the required decision boundary. Pair this with broader subject-level variation in count curvature or capacity so Experiment 6 produces a mixture near 0.44 rather than another categorical result. Finally, add an incremental within-stratum excess-membership term alongside—rather than replacing—the accepted redundancy normalization. A small cost for each additional supported duplicate group is needed for Experiment 16 and the cardinality profile in Experiment 17. These changes preserve the prescribed clustering mechanism and the successful narrow-gap result while targeting the remaining false replication, weak reliability sensitivity, and cardinality-specific failures.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 3 candidate loss=0.2471 -> iter 4 candidate loss=0.2329 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 4
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iteration 4 is the best candidate so far and remains faithful to the prescribed Coherence-Constrained Source Clustering family. The accepted changes produced meaningful gains: Experiment 1 is now close to the human value (-0.105 versus -0.122), Experiment 22 retains an excellent narrow-over-exact fit (0.686 versus 0.682), Experiment 24 continues toward the required narrow-over-broad preference, Experiment 6 moves from 0.08 to 0.12, and the chain excesses in Experiments 18 and 20 decline somewhat. The positional nulls in Experiments 4, 5, and 7–9 also remain intact. However, the theory is not yet experiment-invariant. Its largest remaining structural error is that multi-member chains still collect too much value from locally narrow pairwise gaps: chain choice remains 0.678 versus 0.498 in Experiment 18 and 0.711 versus 0.504 in Experiment 20; wide dyads are still favored in Experiment 19 (+0.097 versus -0.028); and rejection of fully separated tetrads remains much too weak in Experiment 23 (-0.089 versus -0.354). Experiment 21 likewise overproduces strong diverse-tetrad preferences (0.86 versus 0.64). Thus compact-replication filtering helped, but local pairwise corroboration and compressibility can still overwhelm coalition-level incoherence. Reliability-configuration effects are also largely absent: Experiments 12–14 remain near chance rather than showing the observed distributed-coalition preferences, Experiment 10 predicts 0.481 rather than 0.172, and Experiment 2 predicts slight agreement rather than strong opposition to the highest-validity discriminating cue. Finally, redundancy and cardinality effects remain too shallow in Experiments 6, 16, and 17. The single-duplicate preference is only 0.528 versus 0.678, and the Experiment 17 profile is -0.025 versus -0.349. These discrepancies are too large and systematic to ship despite the improved aggregate loss.
Rationale: Build on iteration 4: the most recent advice was accepted, so preserve the direct dyadic resolution gate, compact replication criterion, modest validity increase, and two-to-three transition mechanism. The next adjustment should target a different in-family failure rather than repeat the previously rejected package of globally tighter clustering and stronger penalties. First, add a coalition-level coherence gate for coalitions of three or more experts. At present, a broad chain can earn corroboration from several locally narrow pairs and a compressibility bonus even when its global reliability span implies weak consensus. Multiply independence and compressibility credit by a smooth function of posterior global spread, unsupported occupied strata, or maximum/robust pairwise separation. Keep this gate weak or absent for dyads so the excellent Experiment 22 fit is protected. This should selectively lower Experiments 18, 20, 21, and 23 without indiscriminately suppressing compact replicated structures such as Experiment 1. For Experiment 24, only a small dyadic tail adjustment is warranted because the current 0.394 is already moving toward 0.321; do not narrow the successful corroboration peak itself.

Second, revise how contextual reliability enters coalition value rather than merely increasing the same tiny `validity_reliance` range again. The current within-experiment normalization and coalition averaging reduce communicated validity to a nearly negligible perturbation. Use a bounded coalition-level mean-diagnosticity or quality-contrast term after clustering, separate from the dispersion guard, so reliability configurations can influence Experiments 10 and 12–14 without turning every gap into monotonic individuation evidence. In particular, high mean quality should offset some dispersion cost, but it should not erase the global coherence gate for chains. This remains the recommendation's weak contextual reliability component, not a switch of mechanism family.

Third, extend the accepted compact-excess idea selectively: charge a small incremental cost for each additional well-supported redundant stratum, rather than mainly for total excess mass. The human contrast in Experiment 16 concerns accumulation across duplicate groups, while Experiment 1 requires two compact replicated endpoints still to beat unsupported singleton levels. A bounded second-stratum surcharge can express both. Finally, increase the upper range of `triad_transition_gain` modestly and widen subject heterogeneity specifically in that gain or count curvature, because Experiment 6 is improving in the correct direction but remains far below the observed 0.44 and has too little between-subject variance. Avoid increasing general salience heterogeneity, which would unnecessarily inflate variance in equal-cardinality diagnostics such as Experiment 24. These are focused normalization and gating changes within the prescribed clustering model and retain the components that the accept gate has validated.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 4 candidate loss=0.2329 -> iter 5 candidate loss=0.2705 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

### Iteration 5
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The current candidate remains nominally faithful to Coherence-Constrained Source Clustering, but it was decisively rejected by the accept gate: loss rose from the accepted iteration-4 value of 0.2329 to 0.2705. The new package achieved its narrow intended benefit for chains—Experiments 18 and 20 moved from 0.678/0.711 to 0.603/0.637, and Experiment 6 improved from 0.12 to 0.16—but caused much larger reversals across the core evidence. Experiment 1 changed from an excellent -0.105 to the wrong-sign +0.138. Distributed-coalition effects collapsed in Experiments 12–14: 0.423 versus 0.669, -0.181 versus +0.324, and 0.468 versus 0.587. Experiment 21 fell catastrophically from 0.86 to 0.10 against 0.64. Experiment 10’s excessive exact-coalition choice rose from 0.481 to 0.581, Experiment 15 worsened from -0.007 to -0.086, and Experiment 16 fell from 0.528 to 0.471 despite the added redundant-stratum surcharge. The near-over-exact result in Experiment 22 remains reasonably close, and positional nulls remain intact, but those successes were already present in iteration 4. The pattern indicates that the new global coherence gate and coalition-level mean-diagnosticity term are not selective: they suppress many useful multi-expert configurations along with chains, while the redundant-stratum statistic either fails to distinguish the intended duplicate structures or is overwhelmed by the other additions.
Rationale: Because the latest advice produced a rejected candidate, do not repeat or intensify its package of global-span gating, post-clustering mean-quality bonuses, second-stratum surcharge, and expanded triad gain. Build again from the unchanged accepted iteration-4 base. Remove the new coalition-level coherence multiplier and bounded mean-diagnosticity term rather than trying to retune their current ranges; their joint introduction is associated with the wrong-sign reversals in Experiments 1, 12–14, and 21. Also restore the iteration-4 triad-gain range: its small improvement in Experiment 6 was outweighed by the large Experiment 15 regression.

For the next attempt, make one more local in-family correction to chain overvaluation: change how corroboration is aggregated, not how the entire coalition is penalized. Compute independence credit once between posterior reliability strata, with a smooth cap or soft maximum-matching over distinguishable stratum pairs, rather than allowing every locally narrow expert pair to contribute. Weight each stratum-level link by compact support and balanced cluster mass. This should prevent chains in Experiments 18 and 20 from accumulating several narrow-link benefits while preserving compact replicated endpoints and other coherent multi-member coalitions that the rejected global-span gate destroyed. Keep the successful dyadic Goldilocks function unchanged to protect Experiment 22.

Before reintroducing any duplicate-stratum cost, unit-test its sufficient statistic on the exact configurations from Experiments 1 and 16. The current surcharge moved Experiment 16 in the opposite of its intended direction, showing that expected `replicated_strata` does not reliably order single- versus double-duplicate structures under the soft posterior. Any later correction should operate on posterior-supported excess mass per occupied stratum and demonstrably assign greater redundancy load to the double-duplicate coalition while retaining the compressibility advantage of two balanced replicated endpoints over unsupported singleton levels. Make this separable from corroboration and quality terms. Finally, do not pursue Experiments 10 and 12–14 with another global mean-validity term; the rejected result shows that this normalization has the wrong cross-experiment consequences. First test whether cluster-support/compressibility normalization itself correctly ranks their configurations, then consider only a very small signed quality contrast at the final comparison stage if necessary.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 5 candidate loss=0.2705 -> iter 6 candidate loss=0.2269 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

### Iteration 6 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: Iteration 6 is accepted and improves the running-best loss from 0.2329 to 0.2269, so the prior recommendation to replace global coalition penalties with local stratum-level corroboration pooling was productive. It reduces the chain excesses in Experiments 18 and 20 from 0.678/0.711 to 0.623/0.663 while preserving the excellent dyadic Goldilocks result in Experiment 22 (0.670 versus 0.682). It also retains the intended positional nulls in Experiments 4, 5, and 7–9 and remains faithful to Coherence-Constrained Source Clustering. Nevertheless, the account is not experiment-invariant. Chains remain substantially overvalued in Experiments 18 and 20, wide dyads have the wrong contrast in Experiment 19 (+0.111 versus -0.028), and rejection of fully separated tetrads remains much too weak in Experiment 23 (-0.097 versus -0.354). Experiment 21 also remains overly categorical toward diverse tetrads (0.90 versus 0.64). The strongest-link cap therefore still allows an isolated favorable link within an otherwise unsupported coalition to confer too much corroboration. Major independent failures also persist: Experiment 2 has the wrong sign (+0.042 versus -0.264), Experiment 10 greatly overselects exact dyads (0.470 versus 0.172), Experiments 12–14 miss distributed-coalition preferences, and Experiments 16–17 show far too little accumulating redundancy/cardinality structure. Experiment 6 remains well below the human three-versus-two rate (0.16 versus 0.44). Several successful point estimates are also too heterogeneous, especially Experiments 1 and 22, whereas Experiment 6 lacks the heterogeneity implied by its target mean.
Rationale: Build on iteration 6 and preserve the accepted local stratum-pooling idea, the direct dyadic resolution gate, and the compact-replication criterion. Do not return to the rejected iteration-5 package of global-span gating, post-clustering mean-quality bonuses, or a separate duplicate-stratum surcharge. Instead, refine the accepted aggregation locally: the current maximum stratum link only asks whether one good compact pair exists. Weight that selected link by how much of the coalition is covered by its two supported strata, and discount posterior mass left in unsupported or weakly occupied residual strata. A genuine balanced 2+2 structure should have nearly complete coverage, whereas a chain or four singleton-like levels should not receive full value from one locally narrow link. Strengthen the transition to this coverage-limited credit modestly for n>=4, rather than imposing a global spread penalty. This should continue the accepted improvements in Experiments 18, 20, 21, and 23 while leaving dyads and triads—and therefore Experiment 22—unchanged.

Next, unit-test and recalibrate the existing `compact_excess` statistic rather than adding the previously rejected second-stratum surcharge. It should demonstrably assign more redundancy to the double-duplicate coalition in Experiment 16 than to the single-duplicate coalition, while preserving the compressibility advantage of a balanced replicated 2+2 tetrad over four unsupported levels in Experiment 1. If the posterior currently collapses both patterns into similar low-k solutions, adjust cluster support or complexity normalization so supported mass-2 strata are resolved consistently; then modestly increase the existing compact-excess cost only if that ordering is correct. This same correction should deepen the shallow Experiment 17 profile.

Finally, tune the two-to-three cardinality release separately from general structure. A modest isolated increase or widening of `triad_transition_gain`, coupled with subject variation in that parameter rather than greater cue salience, is warranted because Experiment 6 remains at 0.16 versus 0.44. Keep saturation beyond three intact. Conversely, narrow `salience_strength` or its profile dispersion slightly, since Experiments 1 and 22 have substantially excessive between-subject variance and exchangeable salience cannot explain the missing cardinality heterogeneity. These are targeted in-family adjustments that extend the direction validated by the accept gate without repeating the rejected global intervention.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 6 candidate loss=0.2269 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.2338 -> the gate marked it REJECTED.

This remains a local consensus-coherence calculation and avoids the previously rejected global-span gate.\n\nThere is also an implementation-level faithfulness issue: coherence_width is loaded but never used; broad-dispersion onset is instead derived entirely from corroboration_peak and corroboration_width. This conflates the narrow independence peak with the separate between-cluster coherence parameter required by the arbiter. Use coherence_width to control a distinct, smooth dyadic tail decline, calibrated between the .004\u2013.006 near-gap regime and the .014 broad regime. Keep Experiment 22's direct resolution gate unchanged. Apply the existing contextual-quality moderation only to this coherence penalty\u2014without adding the rejected post-clustering mean-quality bonus\u2014so low-quality broad dyads in Experiments 19 and 24 are penalized while high-quality unequal dyads in Experiment 10 are not indiscriminately suppressed.\n\nBefore changing redundancy cost, verify deterministic coalition scores for the exact stimuli in Experiments 1, 16, and 17. The current compact_excess machinery still does not generate the required cardinality profile, but the previously attempted separate duplicate-stratum surcharge was rejected. Any adjustment should therefore modify how existing supported excess mass is inferred or normalized, not add another surcharge. Prioritize the partition-wide link aggregation and the currently missing independent coherence scale as isolated changes; retain the accepted dyadic Goldilocks mechanism and positional exchangeability."
