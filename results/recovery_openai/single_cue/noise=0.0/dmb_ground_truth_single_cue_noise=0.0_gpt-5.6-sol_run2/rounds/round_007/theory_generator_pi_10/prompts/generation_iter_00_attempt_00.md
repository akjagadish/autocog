# generation_iter_00_attempt_00

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist and an expert Python programmer.

Your job is to propose a new theory and its model instantiation in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain based on the feedback provided by an arbiter. The feedback contains diagnoses of mechanistic failures of the previous theory along with suggestions for a new theory family that overcomes those failures. The newly proposed theory and model should display human-like behavior when simulated on experiment(s). 
The goal of the theory generation process is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across the majority of experiments. 
You will see a list of theories that have been proposed in the past but you should only use them as inspiration and not to choose from them. Propose a new theory that is different. 
If they fail to do so, you will receive feedback on their performance on the same experiment(s) and you will have to propose another new theory and model that meet the requirements, iterating until you succeed.

If you think the failure to capture human behavior is due to arbiter feedback that is inaccurate or unhelpful, you can propose a new theory and model that ignore the feedback, but you must provide rationale for why you are ignoring it and how your proposal overcomes the identified mechanistic failures.

## ACCEPT GATE & LOSS TRAJECTORY — HOW THE LOOP HANDLES YOUR EDITS
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate: after every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss; strict improvement -> ACCEPTED (the candidate becomes the new running-best base); otherwise -> REJECTED (the candidate is discarded and the base is unchanged). You do NOT need to manually "revert" a regressed edit — the gate already does that for you.

The block rendered below as `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE (this loop)` is ALWAYS the running-best (last ACCEPTED) candidate, NEVER your most recent attempt if it was rejected. So:
  * Treat `## PREVIOUS CANDIDATE` as a known-good base. Build on it.
  * The `## LOSS TRAJECTORY` block tags every iteration ACCEPTED or REJECTED. Use this as ground truth on which past critic advice actually moved the loop forward and which didn't.
  * The `## PRIOR FEEDBACK ITERATIONS` block annotates each prior critique with the same ACCEPTED/REJECTED tag of the candidate it elicited. Down-weight critic advice whose previous candidates were REJECTED, and reinforce / extend advice whose candidates were ACCEPTED.
  * Treat the best ACCEPTED iteration's loss as a soft floor — the next edit should plausibly land at-or-below it, otherwise the gate will reject your attempt and the base stays put.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

## PARAMETER NOTATION
`parameters` is a JSON object mapping each parameter name (snake_case string) to a *string* value that specifies its domain. Every value MUST be a string — never a bare list, number, tuple, or expression. Use exactly one of these notations per parameter:

1. Continuous interval — square brackets, two numeric bounds:
   "[min, max]"
   Examples: "[0, 1]", "[1.0, 10.0]", "[10, 1000]"

2. Discrete set — curly braces, comma-separated values:
   "{v1, v2, ...}"
   Example: "{1, 2}"

3. Vector of intervals whose length is set by the experiment — a bracketed tuple repeated by a symbolic length variable:
   "[(min, max)] * length_var"
   Example: "[(0, 1)] * n_features"

4. Symbolic reference — a bare variable name (no brackets, no angle brackets), used when the parameter takes its value from an experiment-defined constant rather than a range:
   "variable_name"
   Example: "n_features"

Rules:
- Do not use parentheses for intervals; square brackets only. Tuples `(a, b)` are reserved for the vector-of-intervals notation in (3).
- Do not mix notations within a single value (e.g., no "[0, 1] or {2, 3}").
- Do not quote numbers inside the notation (write "[0, 1]", not "['0', '1']").
- Every parameter referenced by `predict` or `policy` must appear as a key in `parameters`, and vice versa.
- Notations 3 and 4 may ONLY reference the experiment-defined symbolic identifiers listed under "ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS" below. Do not invent new identifier names. If a parameter's shape doesn't fit any of those variables, fall back to a literal interval (notation 1) or discrete set (notation 2). Use these names so the model adapts to any experiment in this domain instead of hardcoding shapes.

## ALLOWED SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS (for notations 3 and 4 above)
- n_features: Number of expert ratings per option (LLM-proposed via `validities` length).
- validities: Per-expert validities (LLM-proposed; each in [0.5, 1.0]); fixed across all trials.

## AVAILABLE IMPORTS inside `predict` and `policy`
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- scipy and its submodules
- torch and torch.nn.functional as F
- sklearn and its submodules
- math, random, and other standard Python libraries

## RUNTIME CONTRACT (function signatures and argument shapes)
`predict(parameters, state, history) -> np.ndarray`:
- `parameters`: dict[str, value]. One sample drawn from your declared `parameters` ranges, applied for the entire subject run.
- `state`: the per-trial input delivered by the experiment (shape is domain-specific — see the experiment description above and the `history` key list below, which mirrors the per-trial variables carried in `state`). Convert to an array with `np.asarray(state)` if you need array ops.
- `history`: dict-of-lists for past trials in this subject's run, NOT a list-of-dicts. The per-trial keys are:
  Each value below is a Python list in trial order; entry `i` is the value for trial `i`. On the first trial all lists are empty.
  - `"option_a_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option A on this trial.
  - `"option_b_ratings"`: List of n_features binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1) for option B on this trial.
  - `"response"`: 0 if subject chose A, 1 if subject chose B.
Iterating `for x in history:` iterates the dict KEYS (strings); to walk trials index the lists in lock-step, e.g. `for i in range(len(next(iter(history.values())))): ...`.
- Returns: 1-D `np.ndarray` of choice probabilities over the experiment's discrete action set, summing to 1.

`policy(probs) -> int`:
- Receives the probability vector produced by `predict`.
- Returns: integer index in `[0, len(probs))` identifying the chosen action. If you sample with `np.random.choice(..., p=probs)`, normalise first (`probs = np.asarray(probs, dtype=np.float64); probs /= probs.sum()`) to avoid the "probabilities do not sum to 1" ValueError from float drift.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

Each subject completes ~96 trials in a single block, with order randomized independently per subject. On every trial the subject sees two options A and B, each described by `n_features` binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). The per-feature validities and n_features are fixed per experiment (design-time choices). Validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Both `n_features` and `validities` are exposed to your `predict` via the `parameters` dict. The subject chooses A or B; no correctness feedback is provided after the choice.

## ARBITER GUIDE
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_8`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_9`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_8`).

Replace pi_8 with a new theory of latent-source category compression. The central claim should be that people infer a small set of exchangeable latent information sources from experts' represented reliability categories. Experts assigned to the same latent source share a cluster-level evidence budget, with concave growth as members are added, while evidence from distinct inferred sources combines additively and then undergoes generic coalition-level count normalization. This is not pi_8's dyadic/triadic switch or one-unit topology detector, and it is not pi_9's independent continuous pairwise discount applied to every neighbor. It instead treats redundancy as probabilistic source partitioning: one duplicate cluster is redundant already in a dyad, adding an unrelated outsider leaves approximately the same duplicate cost, and two duplicate clusters consume two separate cluster budgets. That yields a near-zero interaction in Experiment 1 and a strong single- versus double-duplicate contrast in Experiment 2. Use sharply localized or softly categorical reliability-region assignment so exact or nearly exact matches produce substantial compression without pi_9's excessive broad reliability-gap gradient, addressing Experiments 12 and 13. Direct validity should remain strongly compressed, allowing coalition size and effective independent-source count to outweigh a uniquely high-validity cue as in Experiments 3-5. Include a separately calibrated, moderately concave transformation of effective source count so three-versus-two judgments and the subject-majority statistic in Experiment 8 are not forced toward pi_9's extreme predictions. Preserve exchangeable, zero-centered subject salience and no serial-position mechanism to retain the null results in Experiments 6-7 and 9-11. Subject heterogeneity should primarily affect category boundary uncertainty, within-source pooling curvature, and count calibration. The next proposed experiments should independently manipulate the number of duplicate clusters, members per cluster, and distances around category boundaries, thereby distinguishing latent-source partitioning from pi_9's smooth pairwise credit sharing.

## THEORY LEADERBOARD
A small set of prior picked theories shown for reference. Overall score is in `[0, 1]`, higher = better, computed as `1 - L2_norm(normalized_per_experiment_distances) / max_L2_norm`. 1.0 means closest to the real value on every experiment+metric pair; 0.0 means farthest. Each entry below carries the same depth of detail as the PREVIOUS MODEL INSTANCE above so you can borrow concrete mechanisms when useful.

### `pi_9` (overall score: 0.804)

**Description**
Reliability-Space Credit Sharing proposes that people interpret agreement among experts through an inferred dependence network defined entirely in represented reliability space. Advertised validities have two related but distinct cognitive representations: a strongly compressed representation determines each cue's direct evidential weight, while a separately calibrated fixed-anchor representation determines inferred dependence. Within any option-supporting coalition, every expert shares informational credit with similarly represented experts according to a smooth, sharply localized similarity kernel. An expert surrounded by reliability-near neighbors therefore contributes less independent evidence, whereas reliability-distant experts contribute nearly undiluted evidence. The steep but continuous kernel concentrates redundancy around extremely similar reliability representations, producing a strong equality penalty without a broad dyadic reliability-gap gradient. Credit sharing applies at every coalition size, without an equality detector, dyadic/triadic switch, spatial grouping rule, or duplicate-pair-in-context operation. Because additional coalition members create multiple possible similarity relations, local dependence can accumulate nonlinearly in larger coalitions even when its effect on a single nonidentical pair is weak. Effective evidence is additionally subject to generic sublinear count growth. Stable subject-level dependence sensitivity, overlap curvature, compressed validity reliance, and exchangeable zero-centered cue salience generate individual differences without population-level serial-position effects. Choices arise from response sensitivity plus an independent lapse process, and representations remain fixed because no outcome feedback is provided.

### `pi_7` (overall score: 0.700)

**Description**
Reliability-Schema Source Inference proposes that decision makers treat expert agreement as evidence generated by latent informational sources rather than as conditionally independent votes. Advertised validities identify experts' reliability schemas. Dependence inference operates at two scales: an extremely narrow component assigns nearly identical, jointly extreme experts a high probability of sharing a source, while a narrower but stronger shoulder captures partial dependence among merely similar reliability schemas. For two-member coalitions, an additional equality-specific jointly extreme source prior produces nonlinear skepticism toward exactly matched reliable experts without increasing dependence for larger coalitions. Thus equally extreme coalitions can be discounted sharply without treating moderately heterogeneous coalitions as fully independent. Every discriminating cue contributes, but its contribution is divided by inferred latent-source overlap. Coalition evidence has diminishing returns, and nominal count corroboration is capped after three members. The transition from two to three members receives an additional corroboration gain only to the extent that the coalition represents informationally diverse sources. Stable subject-level priors over source dependence and count-versus-independence tradeoffs produce heterogeneous three-versus-two judgments without rewarding arbitrarily large coalitions. Communicated reliability differences are strongly compressed, preventing a single advertised-best expert from dominating a diverse majority. The computation is exchangeable over expert identities and contains no onset, closure, recency, adjacency, entry, exit, or other spatial parsing mechanism.

### `pi_6` (overall score: 0.691)

**Description**
Exchangeable Corroboration with Idiosyncratic Salience proposes that people retain the direction of every discriminating expert rating but strongly compress instructed differences in expert validity. Supporting cues are integrated into option-level coalitions whose evidence increases sublinearly, so additional agreement provides corroboration with diminishing marginal impact. Subjects differ in how they calibrate coalition members beyond the first two: a signed, stable calibration parameter makes an additional cue corroborative for some people and partially redundant for others. Separately, jointly diagnostic cues can be perceived as partially redundant: an order-free composition term discounts coalitions containing several simultaneously strong cues, with its effect centered between the competing coalitions. This composition discount is strongest for equal-sized coalitions but remains moderately active when coalition sizes differ. Cue order has no population-level directional role. Instead, each subject has a stable, broad cue-salience profile drawn from a zero-centered exchangeable distribution and centered again within the display. Consequently, individual subjects can show substantial configuration preferences, but there is no common early, late, onset, closure, or entry-versus-exit advantage. Choices result from the difference between the two saturated coalition signals, transformed by response sensitivity and an independent lapse process. Because no outcome feedback is supplied, neither validity beliefs nor salience profiles are learned across trials.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS
- The parameters should be within the specified ranges.
- The model's predictions should be valid probability distributions (non-negative and sum to 1).
- When converting logits to probabilities via softmax, always use the numerically stable form: subtract the max before exponentiating (`x = x - np.max(x); p = np.exp(x); p /= p.sum()`). A naive `np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))` overflows to Inf/NaN for large logits. Alternatively, use `scipy.special.softmax`.


## PROPOSAL
Propose a novel theory from scratch based on all the information available, faithfully implementing the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed above. Do NOT simply reuse anything generated in past rounds.

{
  "theory": "Categorical Source-Budget Inference proposes that people recode instructed expert reliabilities into a small number of latent reliability categories and treat experts in the same category as exchangeable observations from one information source. Category boundaries are stable within a person but uncertain across people, so nearby reliabilities can be categorized together without producing a broad continuous reliability-gap gradient. Within each option-supporting coalition, members assigned to one category draw from a shared evidence budget whose value grows as a concave power of cluster membership. Budgets belonging to distinct categories are added, making redundancy a property of the inferred source partition rather than a collection of independent pairwise discounts. Thus a duplicate pair is already redundant in a dyad, an unrelated outsider adds a separate budget without changing the pair's redundancy, and two duplicate clusters consume two budgets. The resulting evidence is subjected to generic nominal-coalition normalization and a separately calibrated concave transformation of effective source count. Instructed validity differences have little direct influence after strong compression. Stable, exchangeable, zero-centered cue salience permits individual configuration preferences but creates no population-level serial-position mechanism. With no correctness feedback, category maps and cue salience remain fixed across trials.",

Exact and nearby reliability values are compressed into common categories, but dependence changes primarily when a category boundary is crossed. This supports the sharp duplicate effects needed in Experiments 10 and 12-14 without imposing pi_9's broad reliability-gap gradient in Experiment 11. Concave cluster budgets make one duplicate cluster redundant in both dyads and triads; adding an unrelated source contributes a new additive budget without altering the old cluster, yielding little dyad-versus-triad interaction in Experiments 1 and 15. Coalitions containing two duplicate clusters receive two separately saturated budgets, whereas a coalition with one duplicate cluster and additional independent sources has a larger effective source count, producing the Experiment 16 contrast. Strong direct-validity compression allows source diversity and coalition size to outweigh a uniquely reliable cue in Experiments 1-5. Separating within-source curvature, nominal coalition normalization, and effective-source-count curvature prevents three-versus-two choices from being mechanically extreme and supplies the heterogeneity relevant to Experiments 6 and 8. Finally, all computations are invariant to cue order apart from exchangeable, centered subject salience, preserving the positional nulls in Experiments 4-9 while allowing stable individual differences."
