# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_8" and "pi_9") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_8" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_9" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_8
Contextual Reliability-Region Compression proposes that people integrate every discriminating expert rating into an exchangeable option-level coalition while representing advertised validities on a strongly compressed reliability-region scale. Coalition evidence grows sublinearly, and stable count calibration can make a third cue either corroborative or partially redundant. Redundancy is order-specific in cardinality but not spatial position: two-cue coalitions receive only a smooth joint-diagnostic composition discount, whereas coalitions of three or more undergo a contextual topology operation. In the latter operation, two cues occupying nearly the same represented reliability region are compressed toward one informational unit when another cue occupies a distinct region. In equal-cardinality contests between multi-cue coalitions, people additionally compare the coalitions' topology relationally. This relational comparison is moderately concave: modest clustered-versus-distributed differences are transmitted approximately linearly, whereas larger differences receive stronger diminishing amplification. The comparison fades smoothly when coalition cardinalities differ, preserving independently calibrated count judgments. Topology sensitivity is stable and heterogeneous across subjects, while pair-composition sensitivity is comparatively narrow. Stable, zero-centered idiosyncratic cue salience permits individual configuration preferences without population-level onset, closure, recency, adjacency, entry, or exit effects. Because subjects receive no outcome feedback, these representations remain fixed across trials.

## THEORY 2 — pi_9
Reliability-Space Credit Sharing proposes that people interpret agreement among experts through an inferred dependence network defined entirely in represented reliability space. Advertised validities have two related but distinct cognitive representations: a strongly compressed representation determines each cue's direct evidential weight, while a separately calibrated fixed-anchor representation determines inferred dependence. Within any option-supporting coalition, every expert shares informational credit with similarly represented experts according to a smooth, sharply localized similarity kernel. An expert surrounded by reliability-near neighbors therefore contributes less independent evidence, whereas reliability-distant experts contribute nearly undiluted evidence. The steep but continuous kernel concentrates redundancy around extremely similar reliability representations, producing a strong equality penalty without a broad dyadic reliability-gap gradient. Credit sharing applies at every coalition size, without an equality detector, dyadic/triadic switch, spatial grouping rule, or duplicate-pair-in-context operation. Because additional coalition members create multiple possible similarity relations, local dependence can accumulate nonlinearly in larger coalitions even when its effect on a single nonidentical pair is weak. Effective evidence is additionally subject to generic sublinear count growth. Stable subject-level dependence sensitivity, overlap curvature, compressed validity reliance, and exchangeable zero-centered cue salience generate individual differences without population-level serial-position effects. Choices arise from response sensitivity plus an independent lapse process, and representations remain fixed because no outcome feedback is provided.

**Rationale:** This design tests a cardinality-specific contextual onset of redundancy. Four equal-reliability coalitions contain two 0.70 experts, whereas four reliability-separated coalitions contain experts with validities 0.65 and 0.7666667. On the bounded-strength scale x=2v-1, both pair types have exactly the same product: 0.40*0.40 = 0.30*0.5333334 = 0.16. Thus, in the 2-versus-2 trials, Contextual Reliability-Region Compression assigns them the same pair-composition load and has no triadic topology operation; apart from very small compressed-validity residuals, it predicts approximately chance-level selection of the separated pair. Reliability-Space Credit Sharing instead strongly discounts the exactly matched 0.70 pair, while the 0.65/0.7666667 pair lies far outside its narrow similarity kernel, predicting a large above-chance separated-pair preference. In matched 3-versus-3 trials, one distinct 0.92 outsider is added to each coalition. This activates the advocated theory's duplicate-pair-in-context operation only for the equal 0.70 pair, as well as its equal-cardinality relational topology contrast, so it now predicts a substantial separated-coalition preference. The competing theory continues to penalize the equal pair through the same cardinality-general credit-sharing rule and therefore predicts a strong separated preference in both dyadic and triadic contests, if anything slightly attenuated after adding an independent outsider. The decisive statistic is the coalition-size interaction: Contextual Reliability-Region Compression predicts an onset from approximately 0.50 in dyads to clearly above 0.50 in triads, whereas Reliability-Space Credit Sharing predicts an already-large dyadic effect with little or negative dyad-to-triad change. Crossed coalition instances, balanced outsider assignments, and exact A/B mirrors control cue salience and response-side bias. Sixteen unique pairs repeated six times yield exactly 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is the preregistered coalition-size interaction: separated-coalition choice probability in 3-versus-3 contests minus the same probability in 2-versus-2 contests. It codes choices relative to coalition type rather than A/B side, so the exact mirrors cancel response-side bias and stable cue-specific salience. Contextual Reliability-Region Compression predicts a positive onset because its duplicate-pair topology operation is activated only once an outsider creates a triad. Reliability-Space Credit Sharing penalizes the equal-validity pair already in dyads and therefore predicts little or negative change after the outsider is added. Each subject contributes 48 observations to each term, making the contrast relatively stable while directly targeting the theories' cardinality-specific disagreement.

**Rationale:** This 16-cue design tests whether redundancy continues accumulating across multiple duplicate reliability clusters or saturates after detecting a duplicate-pair-in-context relation. Two double-duplicate coalitions have validities (0.60, 0.60, 0.90, 0.90), while two single-duplicate coalitions have validities (0.75, 0.75, 0.9621320344, 0.5378679656). Writing bounded diagnostic strength as x=2v-1, these are respectively (0.20, 0.20, 0.80, 0.80) and (0.50, 0.50, 0.9242640688, 0.0757359312). Both coalition types have strength sum 2.00 and sum of pairwise products 1.32, so Contextual Reliability-Region Compression gives them exactly the same pair-composition load. Their sums of compressed diagnosticities are also nearly identical throughout that theory's validity-compression range. Both contain an exact duplicate pair accompanied by reliability-distinct outsiders, making their contextual topology scores close to saturation. Because the contextual theory's topology operation removes at most approximately one informational unit, it predicts only a small preference for the single-duplicate coalition, generally near chance. Reliability-Space Credit Sharing instead applies divisive sharing separately to every coalition member. In the double-duplicate coalition, all four experts have a reliability-identical neighbor and are discounted. In the single-duplicate coalition, only the two 0.75 experts are discounted, while the extreme outsiders contribute nearly undiluted evidence. It therefore predicts a substantially larger preference for the single-duplicate coalition, roughly in the 0.62-0.69 range before subject heterogeneity is integrated. The decisive statistic is mirror-corrected selection of the single-duplicate coalition: a large displacement above chance supports cardinality-general credit accumulation, whereas a small effect supports contextual one-unit topology compression. Four crossed comparisons balance coalition instances and stable cue salience; four exact A/B mirrors control response-side bias. Eight unique pairs are repeated 12 times each for exactly 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 8 unique pairs × 12 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is the mirror-corrected selection rate for the single-duplicate coalitions (the coalitions supported by cues 8–15) against the double-duplicate coalitions (cues 0–7). Reliability-Space Credit Sharing discounts all four members of a double-duplicate coalition but only the duplicated 0.75 pair in a single-duplicate coalition, so it predicts a substantial preference for the latter. Contextual Reliability-Region Compression largely equates these coalitions because their composition load and duplicate-pair-in-context topology are matched, predicting a value much nearer 0.5. Equal weighting of the A-side and B-side mirror orientations removes response-side bias, while pooling all 96 repeated choices keeps the per-subject estimate comparatively stable. The measure is a direct, non-tautological behavioral contrast rather than a restatement of either model's internal calculation.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all 16 experiments, pi_9 is the stronger surviving theory, although neither theory is task-invariant. The clearest evidence comes from the two direct mechanism tests. In Experiment 1, the observed dyad-to-triad interaction was essentially absent (0.0142). This is far closer to pi_9's -0.0350 than to pi_8's strongly positive 0.2675 and directly contradicts pi_8's claimed cardinality-specific onset. In Experiment 2, the observed single-duplicate preference was 0.6779, closely matching pi_9's 0.6575 and sharply contradicting pi_8's near-chance 0.5031. The observed variance in Experiment 2 (0.0032) also closely matches pi_9 (0.0035), indicating that the accumulating-redundancy effect is not merely driven by a small subgroup. Together, these experiments reject both defining restrictions of pi_8: redundancy does not suddenly begin at three cues, and it does not saturate after removing approximately one informational unit. The broader record is mixed. Pi_8 performs notably better in Experiments 3-5, 8, 12, and 13, and closely captures several null positional effects. Pi_9 performs better in Experiments 6, 10-11, 14-16, and especially in the decisive multiple-duplicate Experiment 2. Pi_9 nevertheless has serious failures in Experiments 4 and 8 and overpredicts reliability-gap effects in Experiment 13; thus it should be retained as the current benchmark rather than declared a complete account. The many near-zero results for onset, recency, entry/exit, and closure metrics also support both theories' exchangeability assumption and provide little reason to introduce spatial-order mechanisms. Overall, pi_8's central prose commitments are structurally falsified rather than merely poorly parameterized, whereas pi_9's failures look more like consequences of its particular continuous pairwise credit-allocation implementation and count calibration.",
  "verdict": "new_theory",
  "target_theory_idx": 1,
  "recommendation": "Replace pi_8 with a new theory of latent-source category compression. The central claim should be that people infer a small set of exchangeable latent information sources from experts' represented reliability categories. Experts assigned to the same latent source share a cluster-level evidence budget, with concave growth as members are added, while evidence from distinct inferred sources combines additively and then undergoes generic coalition-level count normalization. This is not pi_8's dyadic/triadic switch or one-unit topology detector, and it is not pi_9's independent continuous pairwise discount applied to every neighbor. It instead treats redundancy as probabilistic source partitioning: one duplicate cluster is redundant already in a dyad, adding an unrelated outsider leaves approximately the same duplicate cost, and two duplicate clusters consume two separate cluster budgets. That yields a near-zero interaction in Experiment 1 and a strong single- versus double-duplicate contrast in Experiment 2. Use sharply localized or softly categorical reliability-region assignment so exact or nearly exact matches produce substantial compression without pi_9's excessive broad reliability-gap gradient, addressing Experiments 12 and 13. Direct validity should remain strongly compressed, allowing coalition size and effective independent-source count to outweigh a uniquely high-validity cue as in Experiments 3-5. Include a separately calibrated, moderately concave transformation of effective source count so three-versus-two judgments and the subject-majority statistic in Experiment 8 are not forced toward pi_9's extreme predictions. Preserve exchangeable, zero-centered subject salience and no serial-position mechanism to retain the null results in Experiments 6-7 and 9-11. Subject heterogeneity should primarily affect category boundary uncertainty, within-source pooling curvature, and count calibration. The next proposed experiments should independently manipulate the number of duplicate clusters, members per cluster, and distances around category boundaries, thereby distinguishing latent-source partitioning from pi_9's smooth pairwise credit sharing."
