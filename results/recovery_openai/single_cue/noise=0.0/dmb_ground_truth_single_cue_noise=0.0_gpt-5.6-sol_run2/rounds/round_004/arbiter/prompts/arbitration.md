# arbitration

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist arbitrating between two theories across multiple experiments in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

Each experiment was proposed alongside a metric and an expected outcome. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, both theories' predicted metric values (from simulated data), and the observed metric value on real data. The two theories are tagged by stable labels (e.g. "pi_5" and "pi_6") and the same labels are reused on each experiment's predictions.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the arbitration is to surface theories that are task-invariant: that is, theories that can explain data across all experiments in the same domain. Perform a deep dive: which among the two theories better captures the observed data?Do not just look at the newest experiments, but look at all experiments together. If a theory is good at explaining all the data keep it. However, if the both theories are good at explaining some experiment but not all, then it might be a good idea to propose a completly new theory that can potentially explain all the data. It is often better to propose a new theory than to propose a new model. Even if one theory is clearly better than the other, instead of proposing a new model, you can propose a new theory that is a stronger competitor to the winning theory instead of proposing a new model. Only propose a new model if both theories are very good and you are confident that the new model will be better than the current one clearly distinguish the two theories.  Then issue a verdict: either "new_model" (keep the current theory description, but regenerate new predict / policy / parameter ranges such that they better capture the observed data across all experiments) or  "new_theory" (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory that can better capture the observed data across all experiments). `target_theory_idx` is 1 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_5" (THEORY 1 below), or 2 if you are acting on the theory labelled "pi_6" (THEORY 2 below). Justify your choice.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## THEORY 1 — pi_5
Reliability-Compressed Parsing Mixtures proposes that communicated cue validities are strongly compressed and all discriminating cues enter a diminishing-returns accumulator. Stable subject-level styles allocate attention among reliability, coalition size, and locally parsed cue groups. Display position has no universal primacy or recency gradient: configuration effects arise from chunk binding and weak interpretation completion. In nearly balanced three-versus-two conflicts, parsing is sensitive to the internal ordering of compact and fragmented portions of a coalition; this translation-invariant run-asymmetry can reverse associations with recency-weighted predictions without assigning greater weight to later cues themselves. Balanced two-versus-two conflicts retain sign-varying parsing effects that cancel at the population level. Completion in conflicts between two coalitions of at least three cues is population-common but weak, graded, and heterogeneous rather than deterministic. Signed size calibration creates stable divisions between subjects who treat an additional cue as corroboration and those who treat it as redundant.

## THEORY 2 — pi_6
Exchangeable Corroboration with Idiosyncratic Salience proposes that people retain the direction of every discriminating expert rating but strongly compress instructed differences in expert validity. Supporting cues are integrated into option-level coalitions whose evidence increases sublinearly, so additional agreement provides corroboration with diminishing marginal impact. Subjects differ in how they calibrate coalition members beyond the first two: a signed, stable calibration parameter makes an additional cue corroborative for some people and partially redundant for others. Separately, jointly diagnostic cues can be perceived as partially redundant: an order-free composition term discounts coalitions containing several simultaneously strong cues, with its effect centered between the competing coalitions. This composition discount is strongest for equal-sized coalitions but remains moderately active when coalition sizes differ. Cue order has no population-level directional role. Instead, each subject has a stable, broad cue-salience profile drawn from a zero-centered exchangeable distribution and centered again within the display. Consequently, individual subjects can show substantial configuration preferences, but there is no common early, late, onset, closure, or entry-versus-exit advantage. Choices result from the difference between the two saturated coalition signals, transformed by response sensitivity and an independent lapse process. Because no outcome feedback is supplied, neither validity beliefs nor salience profiles are learned across trials.

**Rationale:** This 8-cue design isolates the advocated theory's population-common completion term in balanced three-versus-three conflicts. Experts 1-6 all have validity 0.70 and discriminate on every trial; Experts 7-8 have validities 0.95 and 0.55 but give tied ratings, providing the required validity spread without creating reliability or composition differences between coalitions. In each of the first eight pairs, A is supported by exactly three cues, including Expert 6, the final discriminating cue, while B is supported by the complementary three cues. The eight configurations vary which two earlier cues join Expert 6, sampling compact, fragmented, and interleaved coalitions. Reliability-Compressed Parsing Mixtures adds a completion signal favoring A in every configuration because A supplies the final discriminating cue. Its completion increment ranges from 0.323 to 0.575 before response sensitivity, implying a common above-chance closure-coalition tendency, with smaller style-dependent parsing deviations around it. Exchangeable Corroboration with Idiosyncratic Salience has no completion mechanism: coalition sizes, validities, and order-free composition loads are exactly equal, so its population prediction for the closure coalition is 0.5. It permits stable individual configuration preferences from random salience profiles, but these preferences are zero-centered and therefore should produce approximately equal numbers of positive and negative subject-level closure effects rather than the advocated theory's common positive displacement. The final eight pairs are exact A/B mirrors, controlling response-side bias while preserving which spatial coalition contains the final discriminating cue. The decisive quantitative statistics are the closure-coded grand mean and the distribution of subject-level closure effects: reliably above 0.5 and predominantly positive under the advocated theory, versus population-centered at 0.5 with sign-symmetric heterogeneity under the competing theory. Sixteen unique pairs repeated six times yield exactly 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 16 unique pairs × 6 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is the proportion of choices favoring the coalition supported by the final discriminating cue, coded independently of response side. Exact A/B mirrors therefore cancel generic A-versus-B bias, while all 96 observations contribute to a stable subject-level estimate. Reliability-Compressed Parsing Mixtures predicts a population-common completion increment and hence a closure-choice rate clearly above 0.5. Exchangeable Corroboration has no completion term: its stable cue-salience profiles can generate individual closure preferences, but exchangeability makes those effects population-centered at 0.5. The metric directly tests the design's common directional prediction without relying on a deterministic or definitional consequence of the advocated theory.

**Rationale:** This 16-cue design isolates the advocated theory's order-free composition-redundancy mechanism in balanced two-versus-two conflicts. In the first six pairs, A is supported by two experts having the same advertised validity, which increases across conditions from 0.68 to 0.97; B is always supported by the low-validity Experts 7 and 15 (0.55 and 0.60). Every supporting pair is separated by eight positions. Consequently, both coalitions have zero adjacency and cannot place both members in the same width-2, width-3, or width-4 parsing chunk under any competing-theory integration style. Coalition size is also exactly balanced, and the two-versus-two format prevents completion. Reliability-Compressed Parsing Mixtures is therefore reduced to additive compressed reliability evidence and predicts a modest A preference that increases monotonically as A's two validities rise. Exchangeable Corroboration with Idiosyncratic Salience instead computes the pairwise composition load. A's load rises from (2*0.68-1)^2 = 0.1296 to (2*0.97-1)^2 = 0.8836, whereas B's load remains (2*0.55-1)(2*0.60-1) = 0.02. Its strong composition discount overwhelms its very weak reliability weighting, predicting preference for the low-validity B coalition and a steep monotonic decrease in P(A) as A's validity increases. Exchangeable salience can create stable individual deviations but supplies no population-level slope tied to these translated configurations. The final six pairs are exact A/B mirrors. The primary statistic should code selection of the equal-validity coalition: the advocated theory predicts a pronounced negative validity slope, while the competing theory predicts a shallow positive slope. Twelve unique pairs repeated eight times yield exactly 96 trials.

**Computed schedule:** 12 unique pairs × 8 reps = 96 trials per subject.



### METRIC
Rationale:
This is the composition-load-weighted probability of choosing the equal-validity coalition, coded identically across the A/B mirror trials. Weighting by the absolute difference in pairwise diagnostic-strength products emphasizes the high-validity conditions where the theories diverge most, while retaining all six conditions to reduce trial noise and average over cue-specific salience. The advocated theory's redundancy discount predicts a value substantially below 0.5, especially for the strongest equal-validity pairs. The competing theory has no composition discount in these separated 2-versus-2 displays and predicts a value near 0.5 or slightly above it due to reliability weighting. Mirror-invariant coding cancels response-side tendencies, and the weighted proportion remains well-defined for both pooled data and individual-subject slices.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of which theory better captured the observed data across both experiments, and why.
- verdict: Either 'new_model' (keep the same theory description, regenerate the predict / policy / parameter-ranges) or 'new_theory' (the current theory is degenerate; propose a brand-new theory).
- target_theory_idx: Which theory the verdict acts on: 1 or 2, matching THEORY 1 / THEORY 2. If verdict='new_model', this is the theory whose predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be regenerated (description preserved); if verdict='new_theory', this is the theory that will be replaced completely.
- recommendation: If verdict='new_model': how the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='new_theory': a sketch of the new theory that should be proposed and how it differs from both.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "Across all ten experiments, pi_6 is the substantially more task-invariant account. Its summed absolute point-estimate error is approximately 0.243, compared with 0.885 for pi_5. The clearest evidence comes from the targeted tests. In Experiment 1, the observed closure-choice rate was essentially chance (0.4958), matching pi_6 (0.4996) and contradicting pi_5's population-common completion prediction (0.6108). In Experiment 2, the strong preference against the equal, high-validity coalition (0.1723) was captured directionally and fairly closely by pi_6's composition-redundancy mechanism (0.2057), whereas pi_5 predicted chance (0.5023). Experiment 9 independently rejects pi_5's distinctive entry-versus-exit run asymmetry: the observed contrast was 0.0219, almost exactly pi_6's 0.0257 but far from pi_5's 0.2360. Experiments 5 and 6 also favor pi_6, while Experiments 7 and 10 are near-null and weakly discriminating. Experiment 8 favors pi_6 numerically, although its very large between-subject variance makes that comparison less decisive. Pi_5 is closest in Experiment 3 and slightly closer in a few near-null cases, but pi_6 remains reasonably close in Experiments 3 and 4 and wins the decisive mechanism-isolating tests. The variance results reinforce rather than reverse this conclusion: observed behavior is often somewhat more heterogeneous than pi_6 predicts, especially in Experiment 2, but there is no evidence for pi_5's common directional completion or run-order effects. Retaining pi_5 while merely shrinking completion and parsing parameters would erase the theory's defining claims and reduce it toward the exchangeable account, so this is a theoretical failure rather than a parameter-range problem.",

  "recommendation": "Replace pi_5 with a new order-invariant theory of contextual consensus and inferred expert dependence. The theory should propose that subjects strongly compress advertised validity, integrate all discriminating cues with diminishing returns, and treat agreement among experts with similar or extreme advertised reliabilities as evidence that may arise from a shared or redundant informational source. Coalition value should therefore depend on effective informational diversity rather than raw cue count or spatial arrangement: additional heterogeneous cues provide corroboration, while clusters of similarly high-validity cues can be sharply discounted. Stable subject-level priors over expert dependence and over the count-versus-reliability tradeoff should generate the extra heterogeneity seen in Experiment 2 and the subject split in Experiment 8. Unlike pi_5, the new theory must exclude population-common closure, onset, recency, and entry-versus-exit effects, thereby predicting the null results in Experiments 1, 6, 7, 9, and 10. Unlike pi_6, it should derive composition discounting from latent-source or similarity-based dependence inference rather than an unconstrained pair-product penalty, and it should allow nonlinear skepticism toward coalitions of equally extreme advertised validity. This should strengthen the negative effect in Experiment 2 while preserving majority-over-singleton behavior in Experiment 3 and negative agreement with highest-validity-cue heuristics in Experiment 4. The resulting competitor should make new predictions for coalitions that independently manipulate reliability similarity, reliability extremity, and coalition size while holding order fixed."
