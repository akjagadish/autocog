# feedback_iter_01

## System Prompt

You are a renowned cognitive scientist critiquing a freshly proposed candidate theory and model in the Decision Making (Binary Features) domain.

The candidate has been simulated on every previously run experiment. For each experiment you are shown the design, the metric, the value the metric takes on real data, and the value it takes on the candidate's simulated data.

Each metric value below is shown as `point_estimate (var=X)`, where `point_estimate` is `metric(data)` evaluated on the full pooled dataset and `var` is the population (between-subject) variance of the same metric re-applied per `subject_id`. The point estimate is the canonical scalar; `var` reports how consistent that estimate is across subjects (lower = more consistent). `var=n/a` means the metric could not be applied to a single-subject slice.

The goal of the feedback is to SURFACE theories that are EXPERIMENT-INVARIANT: that is,theories that explain data across multiple experiments. 
Your task is to determine whether the candidate captures the human/real behavior well enough across these experiments. Return a verdict:
  * "continue"   — the candidate is good enough; carry on.
  * "regenerate" — the candidate fails to capture the empirical pattern; the proposing agent must produce a new candidate, taking your rationale into account.

Justify the verdict with a concrete diagnosis (which experiments fail, in what direction, what mechanism is likely missing or miscalibrated).

## SCOPE OF YOUR CRITIQUE — STAY INSIDE THE ARBITER'S MECHANISM FAMILY
When an "## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION" block is present below, the proposer was explicitly instructed to implement the mechanism family the arbiter prescribed. Your job is to grade FIT QUALITY *within that prescribed family*, not to relitigate which family should be used — that is the arbiter's call, made one level above this loop.

Concretely:
  * If the candidate misses the data, you may push for MINOR ADJUSTMENTS that keep the prescribed mechanism intact: tightening / widening parameter ranges, adding a temperature, swapping a normalization scheme, fixing a softmax / distance metric, re-balancing attention weights, fixing a learning-rate sign, correcting a bug in the gating or recurrence, etc.
  * You MUST NOT recommend switching to a different mechanism family. Such a switch is the arbiter's prerogative; recommending it here will mislead the proposer into oscillating between families across iterations.
  * Also grade FAITHFULNESS to the recommendation explicitly: if the candidate has clearly drifted into a different family than the one prescribed, say so in the rationale and ask for a return to the prescribed family — again, with minor adjustments, not a re-design.

## ACCEPT GATE — HOW THE LOOP DECIDES WHAT TO BUILD ON NEXT
This propose-loop has a programmatic accept gate. After every iteration the candidate's `aggregate_loss` is compared against the running-best loss (`accepted_loss`):
  * `loss < accepted_loss` → ACCEPTED. The candidate becomes the new running-best base; the next iteration's proposer will build on THIS candidate.
  * `loss >= accepted_loss` → REJECTED. The base is unchanged; the next iteration's proposer will build on the SAME `accepted` candidate again, with your new feedback on top. Rejected candidates are discarded — the loop guarantees the base never regresses, so you do NOT need to ask the proposer to "revert" anything; that already happens for free.

Two consequences for your verdict:
  * If the candidate you are grading was REJECTED by the gate, returning `"continue"` is silently downgraded to `"regenerate"` (returning a worse candidate would defeat the gate). Spend your rationale on a NEW direction the proposer should try on top of the unchanged accepted base, not on defending the rejected attempt.
  * If the candidate was ACCEPTED, you can return `"continue"` to stop the loop and ship this candidate, or `"regenerate"` to keep tuning further.

## LEARN FROM YOUR OWN PAST ADVICE
When a "## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES" block is present below, each prior iteration ends with an "Outcome of your advice" line that says whether the next candidate the proposer produced was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the proposer discarded the result and reset to the previous accepted base). This is the loop's ground-truth signal on whether *your own previous critique was good*. Use it explicitly:
  * If a previous piece of advice was ACCEPTED, it is OK to repeat / extend it. Reinforce in the same direction.
  * If a previous piece of advice was REJECTED, do NOT repeat the same recommendation; in your new rationale, briefly acknowledge that the previous push in that direction was rejected by the gate and try a different in-family knob (or a smaller step in the same direction) instead.
  * If you find yourself oscillating (e.g. iter 1 said "increase α", iter 2 said "decrease α", iter 3 about to say "increase α" again), STOP and recommend a value between the two flanking iterations instead.
  * The "## LOSS TRAJECTORY" block at the top of the user prompt summarises the same information at the loop level — consult it before issuing a new regenerate-with-direction recommendation.


## User Prompt

## EXPERIMENTAL DOMAIN
Subjects repeatedly choose between two fictitious products, A and B. Each option is described by a vector of binary expert ratings (each 0 or 1). Every experiment fixes its own feature count (via `validities` length) and per-expert validities; both are LLM-proposed. The validities are communicated to the subject in the instructions. Subjects pick whichever product they believe is of higher quality. There is no trial-by-trial correctness feedback.

## ARBITER RECOMMENDATION (mechanism family the proposer was told to implement)
The arbiter labelled this round's two theories in its recommendation as follows:
- THEORY 1 = `pi_5`
- THEORY 2 = `pi_6`
- The recommendation below acts on THEORY 1 (= `pi_5`).

Replace pi_5 with a new order-invariant theory of contextual consensus and inferred expert dependence. The theory should propose that subjects strongly compress advertised validity, integrate all discriminating cues with diminishing returns, and treat agreement among experts with similar or extreme advertised reliabilities as evidence that may arise from a shared or redundant informational source. Coalition value should therefore depend on effective informational diversity rather than raw cue count or spatial arrangement: additional heterogeneous cues provide corroboration, while clusters of similarly high-validity cues can be sharply discounted. Stable subject-level priors over expert dependence and over the count-versus-reliability tradeoff should generate the extra heterogeneity seen in Experiment 2 and the subject split in Experiment 8. Unlike pi_5, the new theory must exclude population-common closure, onset, recency, and entry-versus-exit effects, thereby predicting the null results in Experiments 1, 6, 7, 9, and 10. Unlike pi_6, it should derive composition discounting from latent-source or similarity-based dependence inference rather than an unconstrained pair-product penalty, and it should allow nonlinear skepticism toward coalitions of equally extreme advertised validity. This should strengthen the negative effect in Experiment 2 while preserving majority-over-singleton behavior in Experiment 3 and negative agreement with highest-validity-cue heuristics in Experiment 4. The resulting competitor should make new predictions for coalitions that independently manipulate reliability similarity, reliability extremity, and coalition size while holding order fixed.


## CANDIDATE THEORY
Reliability-Schema Source Inference proposes that decision makers treat expert agreement as evidence generated by latent informational sources rather than as a collection of conditionally independent votes. Advertised validities identify experts' reliability schemas: experts with very similar advertised reliability are more likely to be mentally assigned to a common source, and this inferred dependence rises nonlinearly when both experts have unusually high advertised validity. Within each option's supporting coalition, every discriminating cue contributes, but its contribution is divided by the amount of latent-source overlap with the coalition's other members. Reliability-heterogeneous coalitions therefore possess greater effective informational diversity than equally sized homogeneous coalitions. Total coalition evidence also exhibits generic diminishing returns, while a stable subject-level count-versus-independence prior determines whether modest increases in coalition size are interpreted primarily as corroboration or redundancy. Communicated reliability differences are strongly compressed before evidence integration, preventing a single nominally best expert from dominating a heterogeneous majority. The latent dependence prior and count tradeoff are fixed within a subject and vary across subjects, producing stable individual differences without feedback learning. The computation is exchangeable over expert identities: it contains no onset, closure, recency, adjacency, entry, exit, or other spatial parsing mechanism.

`rationale`:
This is a minimal recalibration of the accepted latent-source model. The similarity bandwidth is narrowed so an exactly equal reliability pair is no longer treated much like a pair differing by roughly 0.05. A new overlap_curvature parameter converts inferred common-source overlap into a superlinear redundancy discount, while wider dependence and extremity ranges make the discount both stronger and more heterogeneous for equally extreme coalitions. The background affinity is reduced from 0.15 to 0.02 so this stronger mechanism remains selective: ordinary or reliability-diverse additions retain informational value. Finally, generic saturation is modestly reduced and the count-versus-independence prior is shifted toward corroboration, allowing heterogeneous three-cue coalitions to recover their advantage in Experiments 1, 3, and 6. No positional, closure, onset, recency, or entry-versus-exit term is introduced, preserving the successful order-invariant null predictions.

## LOSS TRAJECTORY (this propose-loop)
Aggregate loss across iterations of THIS propose-loop (lower = better, 0 = perfect, `+inf` = unscorable). The ACCEPTED / REJECTED tag is the loop's programmatic accept-gate decision: `loss < accepted_loss` -> ACCEPTED (becomes new base), else REJECTED (base unchanged). Use this together with the per-experiment values below to grade fit-quality AND your own past advice (see `## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES` below).

- iter 1: loss=0.1222 -> ACCEPTED
- iter 2 (current candidate you are grading): loss=0.1134 -> ACCEPTED
Running-best (last accepted) base: iter 2 at loss=0.1134.

## YOUR PRIOR CRITIQUES (for this propose-loop)
Each block is one of YOUR previous critique iterations: the verdict you returned, the interpretation and rationale you wrote, and an **Outcome of your advice** line that says whether the candidate the proposer produced AFTER following your advice was ACCEPTED (your advice helped — its loss strictly beat the running-best) or REJECTED (your advice didn't help — the gate discarded the candidate). Use this self-history to (a) reinforce advice that was ACCEPTED, (b) avoid repeating advice that was REJECTED, and (c) detect your own oscillation across iterations.

### Iteration 1 (most recent)
Verdict: regenerate
Interpretation: The candidate is faithful to the prescribed order-invariant latent-source family and successfully removes the unwanted spatial signatures. Experiments 5, 7, and 9 are fitted closely, and Experiments 4 and 8 remain reasonably near their intended nulls. However, the central contextual-consensus effects are much too weak. Agreement with the highest-validity cue is insufficiently negative in Experiment 1 (-0.0308 versus -0.1217) and especially Experiment 2 (-0.0175 versus -0.2642). The composition contrast in Experiment 3 is likewise attenuated (-0.0104 versus -0.0410). Most decisively, Experiment 10 shows that equal-reliability coalitions require a far sharper discount: the model predicts 0.4150 endorsement versus 0.1723 observed. Experiment 6 also underpredicts the fraction favoring the three-cue coalition (0.24 versus 0.44), indicating that generic count corroboration is too weak even while similarity-specific redundancy is too weak. Thus the current implementation compresses both desired forces toward indifference rather than separating heterogeneous count benefits from homogeneous-source discounting.
Rationale: Retain the latent-source, exchangeable mechanism, but recalibrate how inferred dependence affects coalition value. In Experiment 10, the unequal comparison pair differs by only about 0.05 in advertised validity; the current similarity bandwidth of 0.035-0.09 often assigns that pair substantial source affinity, so it is not distinguished sharply enough from an exactly equal pair. Try a narrower bandwidth range and a stronger, nonlinear conversion from near-unit affinity to redundancy—such as a superlinear overlap denominator or coalition-level posterior probability of a shared source—rather than merely increasing a generic pair penalty. Increase or widen dependence strength and extremity sensitivity so exactly equal, high-reliability coalitions can be discounted much more strongly and with greater subject heterogeneity; the candidate's Experiment 10 variance is also too low (0.0024 versus 0.0081). At the same time, shift the count-versus-independence prior modestly toward corroboration, or reduce generic saturation, so heterogeneous three-cue coalitions recover the majority advantage needed in Experiments 1, 3, and 6. These two adjustments should be selective: stronger count support for reliability-diverse additions, but sharply stronger redundancy only for highly similar or equally extreme members. Avoid increasing validity reliance or introducing positional terms, since that would threaten the successful null fits and does not address the decisive equal-versus-unequal composition failure.

**Outcome of your advice:** iter 1 candidate loss=0.1222 -> CURRENT candidate loss=0.1134 -> the gate marked it ACCEPTED.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- interpretation: Freeform analysis of the model simulation results on existing experiments and how they do or do not support the proposed model/theory.
- verdict: Either 'regenerate' (regenerate a new model/theory) or 'continue' (keep the current model/theory).
- rationale: If verdict='regenerate', why the current predict / policy / parameter-ranges should be revised. If verdict='continue', a sketch of why the current theory should be kept.


## Response

```json
{
  "interpretation": "The candidate remains faithful to the prescribed exchangeable latent-source family and the accepted recalibration improved aggregate loss, especially by moving Experiment 10 from 0.4150 to 0.2683 while preserving the positional nulls. Experiments 4, 5, 8, and 9 are now close, and Experiment 7 remains broadly consistent with a null despite simulation noise. Nevertheless, the model still misses the central cross-experiment consensus pattern. Experiment 2 is the clearest failure: predicted agreement with the highest-validity discriminating cue is essentially zero (-0.0046) rather than strongly negative (-0.2642), and it worsened slightly despite the overall accepted improvement. Experiment 3's composition-sensitive contrast has also collapsed toward zero (-0.0007 versus -0.0410). Meanwhile, the count recalibration overshot Experiment 1 in the opposite direction: endorsement of the top cue changed from too weakly negative to far too negative (-0.2712 versus -0.1217). Experiment 6 still has too few subjects favoring the three-cue coalition (0.28 versus 0.44). Experiment 10 remains materially underfit (0.2683 versus 0.1723), with insufficient between-subject variance. Thus the successful exact/equal-reliability discount is still too weak, while the ultra-narrow similarity kernel makes dependence inference nearly absent for the nonidentical reliability compositions driving Experiments 2 and 3. Generic count corroboration is also poorly shaped: it overvalues larger coalitions in Experiment 1 without providing enough of the localized three-versus-two advantage in Experiment 6.",
  "verdict": "regenerate",
  "rationale": "Build on the accepted narrow-kernel latent-source model, but do not further increase the existing global count_independence_tradeoff: that accepted change helped Experiment 10 but contributed to the Experiment 1 overshoot and did not solve Experiment 2. Instead, use a two-scale or spike-plus-shoulder source-affinity function within the same inferred-dependence mechanism: retain a very narrow, strong component for exactly equal and jointly extreme reliabilities, while adding a weaker moderate-width similarity component for merely similar schemas. The narrow component should be strengthened cautiously to move Experiment 10 from 0.268 toward 0.172 and its subject-level strength should vary more widely to raise variance. The weak shoulder is needed to distinguish the mixed coalition compositions in Experiments 2 and 3, which the current 0.012-0.025 bandwidth effectively treats as independent. Re-shape generic diminishing returns rather than applying a linear exponential reward per additional cue: allow a specific corroboration gain from two to three effectively diverse sources, then sharply taper gains beyond three. A capped or concave count term can raise Experiment 6's three-versus-two split while reducing the excessive support for four- through six-cue coalitions that drives Experiment 1 too negative. Keep validity reliance low and retain complete order invariance; the successful null results provide no justification for positional terms."
