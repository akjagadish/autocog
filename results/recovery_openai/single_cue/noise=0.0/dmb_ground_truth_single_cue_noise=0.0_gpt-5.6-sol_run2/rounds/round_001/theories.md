### slot 1 — `pi_3` — SURVIVED ✓

**Description:** Accessibility-Balanced Evidence Integration proposes that people encode each communicated cue validity as a subjective diagnosticity signal and combine it with a separate positional-accessibility signal. Diagnosticity favors objectively valid cues, with nonlinear compression or sharpening of validity differences, whereas accessibility can favor cues appearing later or lower in the display. A subject-specific balance determines how strongly each code influences cue weight. On each choice, all discriminating cues contribute their signed evidence to a common accumulator; therefore, several opposing cues can gradually overcome an initially favored cue. Because the accumulator retains evidence magnitude and configuration, the theory predicts graded coalition effects rather than selecting either the first or last discriminating cue. Evidence supporting each option exhibits mild, imbalance-dependent within-coalition diminishing returns before the two directional totals are compared, followed by ordinary response noise and occasional lapses.

**Rationale:** This is the smallest normalization correction to the accepted model. All cue representations, validity-position weights, parameter ranges, response noise, and lapse mechanisms remain unchanged. The only computational edit replaces absolute directional-count normalization with normalization relative to the smaller opposing coalition. In Experiment 1, where one top-cue vote faces a coalition of k lower cues, the minority denominator remains 1 and the majority denominator remains k raised to coalition_saturation, making the computation identical to the accepted candidate and preserving its close fit. In Experiment 2, equal-sized opposing coalitions now both have denominator 1 rather than being jointly attenuated by their absolute size. This allows the existing position-sensitive cue configuration to produce stronger opposition to the first discriminating cue without globally increasing recency or beta. The mechanism remains compensatory and graded: changing coalition imbalance, cue positions, or cue validities continuously changes accumulated evidence, unlike reverse-order Take The Best.

### slot 2 — `pi_2` — KILLED ✗

**Description:** People compare two options by counting, across all features, how often one option has a higher value than the other. The option that wins on more features is chosen. Tallying discards cardinal magnitudes — only the sign of each feature-wise comparison matters — so the heuristic is robust to monotone rescaling of individual features and cannot be swayed by a single large feature difference in the way Equal-Weight can. Ties on an individual feature contribute nothing to either count: that cue is simply treated as uninformative for the pair. No feature is privileged, in contrast to Take The Best; every cue contributes equally to the tally. When the two counts are equal the heuristic has no basis for preference and the learner must guess. Response noise enters through a softmax over the two tallies with inverse temperature beta (interpolating between fully deterministic choice at large beta and uniform guessing at beta = 0), plus an independent lapse that with probability epsilon replaces the softmax output with a uniform pick over the two options.


**Rationale:** (none)

    a_wins = float(np.sum(a > b))
    b_wins = float(np.sum(b > a))
    scores = np.array([a_wins, b_wins])

    # Softmax with max-subtraction for numerical stability. When

## Replacement

### `pi_4` → slot 2 (via `new_theory`)

**Description:** Switch-Closure Coalition Integration proposes that people encode communicated cue validities in a strongly compressed form and then organize simultaneously supporting cues into directional coalitions. Evidence contributed by a coalition grows sublinearly with its size, so each additional cue matters but has diminishing impact. Attention is configuration-dependent rather than governed by a universal positional gradient. A conflict between two singleton cues receives no positional weighting. When equally sized multi-cue coalitions compete, completing the later coalition produces a small switch-closure advantage because it is the most recently completed coherent interpretation. When coalition sizes differ, attention favors coalitions that begin early and remain locally coherent, but this structural gate is strongest for nearly balanced multi-cue conflicts such as three-versus-two and attenuated when a singleton competes with a growing coalition. Thus positional effects can reverse across configurations: terminal closure can favor the later side in balanced coalitions, early coherent organization can dominate nearly balanced multi-cue conflicts, and singleton-versus-coalition decisions remain governed primarily by gradual accumulation. Subject-specific compression, accumulation, attention, response sensitivity, and lapse parameters produce heterogeneity without trial-by-trial learning, which is appropriate because the task provides no outcome feedback.

**Rationale:** This is a one-line parameter-range edit to the accepted iter-2 model. Only `near_balance_gain` is shifted modestly upward, from `[3.5, 5.5]` to `[4.75, 6.25]`. This isolates the mechanism that successfully moved Experiment 3 toward its observed negative covariance while using a smaller, intermediate increase rather than repeating the rejected joint shift. In particular, `balanced_terminal_attention` remains at its accepted range because increasing it produced the large Experiment 2 overshoot. All mechanisms governing singleton-versus-coalition trials, validity compression, accumulation, response noise, and the singleton-versus-singleton positional bypass remain unchanged, preserving the accepted fits in Experiments 1 and 4.

**Parameters:**
  - `validities`: `validities`
  - `validity_compression`: `[0.20, 0.45]`
  - `validity_reliance`: `[0.03, 0.08]`

  - `coherence_gain`: `[0.03, 0.10]`
  - `near_balance_gain`: `[4.75, 6.25]`
  - `singleton_gate_scale`: `[0.20, 0.45]`
  - `beta`: `[0.75, 1.05]`
